Donald Trump remembers exactly when he realized his father was beginning to fade. About six years ago, they were driving down Fifth Avenue when he gave his father big news: he had just bought the land beneath the Empire State Building. ''That's a tall building, isn't it?'' Fred C. Trump replied. ''How many apartments are in that building?'' At first, Donald thought he was kidding. But his father, 87, was developing Alzheimer's.
Fred Trump died last June in Queens, at 93. Donald had visited him in the hospital that night and got the call later when he was by himself, high up in Trump Tower. He cried. It was the saddest day of his life, he says.
The son, now considering a run for the presidency, likes to present himself as a self-made man. But how much of him did his father make? Long before young Trump was putting up glass-and-bronze curtain walls on Fifth Avenue and selling apartments for $38 million, his father was putting bird cages in lobbies to dress up Queens apartment houses -- and releasing balloons on Coney Island at the height of summer with coupons inside for $50 off on a $4,990 Trump home.
Fred Trump was a builder who loved his work. You can still see his achievement throughout Brooklyn today: hundreds of houses and apartment buildings, all of them dapper but not fancy -- like him -- and made of solid materials. Trump's properties were maintained to a fare-thee-well. Brick was repointed; ironwork repainted. Signs over perfect lawns speak in Fred's stentorian tone: ''Positively No Ball Playing Allowed.''
''Freddy was always very neat, a Beau Brummell,'' says his contemporary, Sam LeFrak. ''He had a mustache, and that mustache was always right, perfect.'' He would ask his bricklayers to vary the balustrades on the terraces from one attached house to the next one, in order to create different patterns in the brick: squares, open crosses. Or he would add white shutters to brick apartment buildings to add a touch of class. Trump liked ornamentation, but not the glitzy kind. ''He didn't have frivolous taste,'' says his youngest son, Robert. ''There was not a frivolous bone in his body.''
The story the family tells about Fred Trump is that he was a Horatio Alger, a man who built himself up from nothing during the Depression. In fact, his own father, Fred Trump Sr., was a builder who left a sizable estate, some $30,000. Still, young Fred worked as if he had nothing. He taught his children to work hard too. On Saturdays, Fred Trump took them around as he inspected boiler rooms and spiffed up lobbies. His daughter Maryanne Trump Barry, now a federal judge in Newark, recalls how her father reacted when she took a day off after weeks of work: ''But what will the other judges say?''
A tall, vigorous and imposing man with a square chest and prominent cheekbones, Fred Trump was intensely competitive; he scoffed when a rival used the wrong colored brick to patch a wall. ''He didn't like wimps,'' says John Walter, his nephew. ''He thought competition made you sharper.''
Trump's eldest son, Freddy Jr., did not meet his tough standards. Handsome and fun-loving, Freddy wanted to fly airplanes and deep-sea fish. He wasn't interested in the family business, and he and his father quarreled. Freddy drank himself to death at 43. Donald drank in the lesson of his brother's life and never touched a drop of liquor. Never smoked, never touched coffee.
In Donald, the father found a spirit as large as his own, albeit more devilish. The two thrived on one another. Donald worked for a time with his father in the humble Trump Organization offices on Avenue Z in Coney Island and observed his father's careful business habits. Fred Trump would ask his contractors to get their bills to him by the 20th so he could pay them by the 30th, so they would have the cash to pay their own bills by the 10th of the following month in order to get the 2 percent discount from suppliers.
When Fred built Trump Village on the water, three blocks from his office, he put up a shanty on the job site as an interim office, so that he could always see what was going on rather than have to come three blocks. One day, Donald came into his father's office to find him fiddling around with what looked like a broken push broom. It turned out you could get it cheaper in two sections. ''I learned by osmosis,'' Donald says.
Donald helped his father on deals for a piece of Starrett City and to get into Forest Hills. The fancier parts of Queens were a big psychological leap for Fred Trump, and when his son declared in the early 1970's that he was going into Manhattan, it frightened him. ''New York -- who can work in New York? -- that's impossible,''' his daughter Elizabeth Trump Grau remembers him saying. ''Donald had to prove himself to my father. And in that regard, Donald proved him wrong.''
In a sense, Donald was just doing what his father had done. Fred Trump always had an eye for distressed gems that people were not managing well. He would go to the owner and say, You're obviously having problems here. The challenge of making it right fulfilled him. When Donald Trump started driving around Manhattan, the whole city was distressed. Even the Chrysler Building was going begging. His father helped to capitalize him in these early projects -- though Donald plays down the help. ''The money he would give me was very little, very little,'' Donald says. Certainly his dad's connections helped him out. Once when a cement contractor had given Fred Trump a $900,000 bill, he cut a $1 million check, just for the pleasure of handling such a sum, and hand-delivered it to the contractor. That same cement contractor later poured the Trump Tower in Manhattan.
Like his father too, Donald had a keen sense of people's aspirations. Fred Trump had built homes for working people who wanted to become middle class, people who wanted a little more quality than the stick bungalows they could buy that needed painting all the time. Fred Trump had given his houses brick-veneer construction, Tudor facades and mansard roofs; he built them so well that the ones near the water are worth $300,000 today. He gave his apartment houses English names: Wexford Hall, Sussex Hall, Edgerton. Donald took that understanding to another level, in catering to the desires of the rich.
The wild son has qualities Fred lacked -- daring and imagination. ''Dad was a careful man,'' Maryanne says. ''I don't think he ever took a flyer in his life.'' And Fred Trump never promoted himself; he did not like to put his name on things. Once, he called a supermarket Trump Market, but when King Kullen bought it from him the name came down, and the lesson stuck: they can always take your name off. Employees had to urge the patriarch to paint the small words ''Trump Village'' on the glass lobby of the huge apartment complex he built in the early 60's in Brighton Beach. There may have been ethnic fear in Fred Trump's shyness. He was of German background; indeed, with his piercing eyes and heavy eyebrows, he looked like a Wagnerian hero. But you didn't want to look German in sales in New York around the war years. Indeed, a certain mystification developed about Trump's background. People thought he was Swedish or Dutch.
Donald Trump was the shadow of his father in that respect. He learned early to put his name and face on his product. And his domestic arrangements were different. Fred Trump was married to his wife, Mary, for 63 years. He put his arm around her on the couch and said there was no place he would rather be. ''It was a much simpler life, and perhaps a better life,'' Donald says. ''I wouldn't want to swap it. But there was a beautiful simplicity to it.''
The Trump children say that their father was proud of his son Donald for all he did. ''Look,'' Donald says, ''I had friends whose fathers were very successful, and the fathers were jealous of the sons' success and tried to hurt them, keep them down, because they wanted to be the king. My father was the exact opposite. He used to carry around articles.''
Maybe. But Donald is not a very sensitive person. And how many fathers have unmixed feelings about their sons' achievements? The old man's office in Brooklyn is left just the way it was when he had to stop working last spring. There's humble shag carpet and industrial-grade steel trim, and the walls are crowded with emblems of 80 years of building: faded pictures of the Highlander and Edgerton, a photograph of Fred meeting Ronald Reagan, three of his beloved cigar store Indians.
But there's only one picture of Donald, a framed 1986 cover of Fortune. That was just before ''The Art of the Deal,'' just before Donald became a household name. Just before it became clear that Donald had eclipsed his father's noble achievement forever. They say that when pictures were taken of father and son, Fred would rise just a little on his toes -- so he would look taller.
Taking potshots at Ed Koch, all the Republicans running for president, North Korea, Fidel Castro, Japan, Russia and candidates of humble background, Donald J. Trump today brought his presidential exploratory campaign to Minnesota, where he outlined his vision of a Trump administration and helped raise money for his Reform Party ally, Gov. Jesse Ventura.
Mr. Trump, who called himself ''the biggest developer in the hottest city in the world'' -- that would be New York -- spoke at a Chamber of Commerce lunch and later at a dinner where more than 200 people paid $100 a ticket to attend. Aides to Governor Ventura, the Reform Party's highest-ranking elected official, said the money would be used to spread the party's gospel around the state.
By day's end, however, Mr. Trump seemed no closer to announcing whether he would compete for the party's presidential nomination than when he arrived.
''I am looking very, very seriously at whether or not it can be won,'' he said at a news conference with Mr. Ventura that was sandwiched between his scheduled events. ''Instinctively, I want to know if I have a good chance of winning.''
For Mr. Trump, the visit was a chance to share with appreciative audiences his views of, well, just about everything. He said New York City's inability to fix the Wollman skating rink in Central Park, which Mr. Trump repaired for the city at cost in 1986, showed that Mr. Koch was a bad mayor. Mr. Trump said he watched the Republican candidates debate on Thursday night and concluded: ''Are these people stiffs, or what? It was pathetic.''
He described North Korea as the United States' greatest foreign threat, a country ''run by some very bad people.'' He called himself ''a big, big fan'' of the economic embargo against Cuba, whose president, Mr. Castro, is ''a bad guy.'' He said that Japan had been ''ripping us off for 25 years,'' and that Russia was ''totally mixed up, and they have missiles run by people nobody ever even heard of.''
And he struck a blow for rich people as national leaders, chiding candidates who express pride in their humble backgrounds.
''They're losers,'' Mr. Trump said. ''Who the hell wants to have a person like this for president?''
Without criticizing anyone, he reviewed his proposal to eliminate the national debt with a one-time tax on the nation's wealthiest people and said he would put forth his ideas on health care and overhauling the welfare system within a few weeks.
Mr. Trump said he came to Minnesota as a favor to Mr. Ventura, not to get his endorsement. But the governor made it clear that Mr. Trump would get it if he decided to run. Otherwise, Mr. Ventura said, he would endorse someone else, anyone but Patrick J. Buchanan, the Republican-turned-Reform candidate who is seeking the party nomination.
Because of policy differences with Mr. Buchanan, the governor said, ''It would be very difficult for me to support him.''
There may be many reasons to run for president of the United States, but the chance to turn a profit on the campaign trail is generally not one of them. Unless the office-seeker happens to be Donald J. Trump.
''I'm the only candidate who makes money when he runs,'' said Mr. Trump, who is toying with seeking the Reform Party's nomination for president. Mr. Trump commands $100,000 a speech, he said, adding, with his trademark hyperbole, that he was the highest-paid lecturer in the country.
Whether or not that is strictly true -- the Washington Speakers Bureau, which represents him and other famous speakers, did not return repeated telephone calls -- most political hopefuls speak free, at length, to anyone who will listen.
If Mr. Trump does decide to run -- and he says he will do so only if he is confident that he can win -- his financial affairs are likely to start attracting the kind of attention that until now has been reserved for his colorful personal style (and colorful personal life).
That is in part because profits, broadly speaking, are an important plank in Mr. Trump's potential platform. For one thing, if he runs he has promised to campaign using as much as $100 million of his own money, money he says he has made primarily as a real estate developer (he is also a casino operator, advertising icon and author).
Furthermore, according to his new book -- ''The America We Deserve'' (Rennaisance Books), written with Dave Shiflett, a conservative commentator -- Mr. Trump's wealth helps qualify him for higher office. ''Politicians are on the take and looking for job security,'' he writes. ''Not me.''
Mr. Trump has not filed financial disclosure documents, and right now, even his supporters are not positive that he has $100 million for a campaign. Using his own $100 million would mean he could not accept federal matching funds and would not have to rely on financing from special interest groups, supporters say.
''Does he really have that money? I don't know,'' said Rick McCluhan, chairman of the Reform Party in Minnesota. On the other hand, Mr. Trump does have ''charisma and chutzpah,'' Mr. McCluhan said, as well as the ability to attract attention.
That was in evidence on Wednesday, when Mr. Trump signed books in the marble lobby of Trump Tower on Fifth Avenue. Flanked by two American flags, Mr. Trump faced a phalanx of television crews, reporters and several hundred fans, political supporters, casino patrons, autograph seekers, befuddled shoppers, and tourists on their way to Tiffany's next door. In an hour and a half, he said, he sold 839 copies, at $20 each.
Should Mr. Trump run for president? The crowd's opinion appeared to be mixed. Patricia Joyce and her mother, Alice, were enthusiastic (and they like his casinos, particularly Trump Plaza in Atlantic City). Alvin Hirschberg, a retiree from Brooklyn, said no: ''He'll see he is not as popular outside of New York as he thinks he is.''
Pedro A. Rivera shrugged. ''Well, he's got the money,'' Mr. Rivera said. And in that opulent setting, who could doubt it?
Getting a grip on Mr. Trump's financial situation has never been easy -- just ask the banks that lent him millions in the 1980's, shortly before his real estate and gambling empire collapsed. During his ''rough patch,'' as he calls it, in the early 1990's, Mr. Trump personally owed about $900 million; his casinos filed for bankruptcy protection.
Today, Mr. Trump says he is worth about $5 billion. But Forbes Magazine, which annually calculates the wealth of individuals for its list of the 400 richest people in America, pegs Mr. Trump's net worth at about $1.6 billion. ''That's a pretty aggressive number,'' said Peter Newcomb, the senior editor who supervises the project. ''If anything, it's high.''
Forbes tried to calculate what Mr. Trump could get if he had to sell his holdings today. Mr. Trump values his properties based on what he thinks they will be worth when they are completed and fully sold or leased, Mr. Newcomb said. That makes a big difference in the case of projects like redevelopment of the old rail yards on the Upper West Side of Manhattan, where only 2 of 16 residential buildings have been completed.
The difficulty lies in figuring out what Mr. Trump's real estate ventures are worth. The Trump Organization is a private company, and so does not have to disclose audited financial information. Crain's New York Business magazine ranks the company as the second-largest private company in the city, based on figures supplied by Mr. Trump.
Mr. Trump contends he is ''by far the biggest developer in New York,'' a claim that makes other real estate titans roll their eyes.
Then there is the rather murky issue of ownership. Real estate deals tend to be financially complex, and Mr. Trump's are particularly complicated. He says he owns 50 percent or 100 percent of most of his projects, and he does indeed own several, including parts of the Trump Tower and all of 40 Wall Street, an office building that he bought for the real estate equivalent of a song just before the market in lower Manhattan took off.
But in other cases, when Mr. Trump says he owns half the building, what he seems to mean is that he has the right to half the profit the building may generate in the future. That is the case with the condominium he is building across from the United Nations (and in the teeth of fierce opposition from its wealthy neighbors and community groups). The building will have 72 floors, but Mr. Trump advertises it as 90-stories tall. A South Korean company actually put up the money for the project.
Mr. Trump's latest prize is the old General Motors building on Fifth Avenue, which now has the letters T-R-U-M-P emblazoned on its facade. But Conseco, an Indiana insurance company, put up most of the down payment on the building, real estate specialists say. Mr. Trump and Conseco are 50-50 partners in the 1998 deal and borrowed $700 million together. But documents outlining the deal say the partnership owes Conseco $270 million, and Mr. Trump provided a personal guarantee on $200 million of the building loan. Mr. Trump said, however, that he did not provide any guarantees.
While visitors to Manhattan may feel they see the name Trump on a dozen glittering facades, some of those buildings are condominiums, and are therefore owned by the people who live in them.
That is the case with the old Gulf and Western building near Central Park, now called the Trump International Hotel and Tower. General Electric's pension fund owned the building and hired Mr. Trump to revamp it, which he did by covering it in bronze glass, fixing its tendency to sway in high winds, and converting its office spaces into condo apartments and a hotel.
As a result, Mr. Trump as the developer, received an undisclosed percentage of the profits on the condos, which he says totaled $301 million. And he retains control of the building's commercial spaces.
All these fees do add up, and Mr. Trump also received $140 million in 1996, when the Pritzker family bought out his share of the Grand Hyatt Hotel.
So although he will not say on the record that he has $100 million in the bank, Mr. Trump asserted that he could easily come up with that sum without selling any assets. ''Money today is very plentiful,'' he said.
On the other hand, Mr. Trump does have debts. He borrowed about $25 million from Trump Hotels & Casino Resorts, the public company that owns three casinos in Atlantic City and a gambling riverboat in Gary, Ind. That debt is secured by Mr. Trump's 40 percent stake in the company itself, according to documents the company filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
Mr. Trump borrowed the money so that he could repay a loan from Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette, the Wall Street firm that in 1995 and 1996 helped sell the casino company's stock to the public. When he got that loan, Mr. Trump's shares were worth a lot of money; the stock traded for more than $30 a share in the spring of 1996.
Today, the Trump casino company's shares change hands for less than $3.50, so that Mr. Trump's shares (about 14 million according to Securities and Exchange Commission filings, 16 million according to him) are worth $47 million to $54 million. If he tried to sell them all at once, that would probably depress the stock price even more.
Mr. Trump says he has not repaid the loan not because he does not have the money to do so, but as a favor to the casino company, which is making more off his loan than it could get from putting the money in certificates of deposit. The loan comes due in June, he said.
But the company seems to need all the cash it can get. In the 12 months ended Sept. 30, it generated just enough cash to pay its debt service and capital expenses, without much room to spare, according to John Leupp, a fixed-income analyst at Donaldson Lufkin. As a result, the company's bonds (it owes about $1.85 billion) are rated at the junkier end of the junk-bond scale, B and B-minus, by Standard & Poor's.
Though Mr. Trump has just fired the president of his biggest casino, the Trump Taj Mahal, he said that the casinos were ''doing very well, making a lot of cash flow.''
Whatever the value of his holdings, Mr. Trump said that if he decided to run for president, he would put his businesses in a trust, to be managed by someone else. The prospect appears to fill him with gloom; even someone he trusts ''wouldn't run it the same way,'' he said somberly.
On the other hand, exploring a bid for president has been ''a lot of fun,'' Mr. Trump said. ''And I'm not spending very much money doing it.''
To the Editor:
In his article ''Trump, His Gilded Taste, and Me'' [Dec. 19], Herbert Muschamp writes: ''Mr. Trump builds buildings, I write about them. So far, he hasn't given me an opportunity to write glowingly about his architectural projects.''
But he might have said how much better the Gulf and Western Building did after Mr. Trump's rehab. He might have given Trump Tower credit for using planned setbacks to grow trees in the sky for Fifth Avenue strollers who cast their eyes upward. And he might have credited Trump Tower's three-story, beautifully lit waterfall. The lobby, all marble and a wonderment, draws more tourists than even Tiffany, and possibly as many as Rockefeller Center.
Mr. Muschamp did, however, take time to belittle the Palm Beach mansion that Mr. Trump turned into a beach club. And he gave Mr. Trump no credit for the huge parklike development he is building over the open railroad tracks adjoining the Hudson River.
MORTIMER LEVITT
New York
MILAN—  As dress codes in the workplace continue to ease up, the race is on to find a comfortable alternative to the conventional suit and a new generation of designers see sportswear as the best solution. 
 Prada started the ball rolling with the launch of Prada Sport in 1997. Since then, other established Italian design houses have gone active, including Armani with its swanky golf-wear collection. Last year, Ermenegildo Zegna also launched its own sports label, as did Hugo Boss, which is produced in Italy by Marzotto. 
 Even high-end fabric and suit makers have been quick to see the business potential of sportswear. Brioni, Loro & Piana, and Carlo Barbera will all unveil their first sportswear collections for autumn/winter 2000 at this week's menswear show, Pitti Uomo in Florence. 
 Neil Barrett, Milan's most talked about newcomer, is set to kick off the four-day event Thursday with a runway show held in a disused railroad station in Florence. 
 Now in his second season, the young British designer is fast gaining a name for himself on the international fashion circuit with his softly tailored line of menswear and now womenswear designed and produced in Italy. 
 After five years designing at Gucci, Barrett was head-hunted by the Prada chairman Patrizio Bertelli who asked him to start up the Prada menswear label. 
 Four years later, he decided to go solo. "I was so fed up with waking up each morning and not finding the right thing to wear in my wardrobe that I decided to do something about it." 
 So keen is the designer to put an end to that global problem commonly referred to as "wardrobe crisis" that he plans to keep designing until men find they don't need anything anymore. Hence his decision to drop formal suits from his collection. 
 "Fewer men buy suits these days, as they already have enough to chose from," he said, adding that "designers in the formal-wear market will have to work harder at promoting themselves in the financial districts that depend on them." 
 Unlike other designers, Barrett is keen to avoid flooding the menswear market with designer sportswear brands by making sportswear an integral part of his collection. 
 For spring/summer 2000, he pairs crisp cotton shirts with streamlined jackets and padded vests. He wants men to look masculine, not like urban warriors, choosing to enhance the body though an innovative use of natural and plain fabric gauges. 
 Also based in Milan, the American designer Lawrence Steele is giving a unique look to sportswear with his unisex label LSD. Steele is already speeding into his second season with laser-sharp cuts and a mix of luxurious and high-tech materials. 
 "Men have eased up in the way in which they present themselves and sportswear is the best way to express this new cultural mood," Steele says. 
 Based in Milan for the last 14 years, Steele worked with Franco Moschino and Miuccia Prada before venturing out with his first womenswear label in 1994. 
 His current sportswear collection includes jeans made from a selection of retro Japanese denims, jackets made from neoprene, and functional coats that can be worn in several ways thanks to detachable thermal linings. 
 "The great thing about sportswear is that it is so versatile," he says, noting his innovative fabric lineup. For instance, Steele's own specially developed thermal fabric has a skin-like hand that regulates body heat to a snug degree. 
 Coming from America, where the "casual Friday" wear trend began, he sees cultural differences in the way sportswear is worn. Compared to American men, Steele says, Europeans are more likely to wear sophisticated sportswear to the office. "The U.S. mass market is more gym-oriented. Here in Europe, it's a lot more luxury-based." 
 When it comes to exclusive menswear, Jil Sander has been introducing luxury into sportswear since 1997. 
 She may have loosened her style with the end of minimalism but still keeps to her sharp-tailored principles. Last season, she sent models down the runways in cropped cotton pants and square-cut shirt jackets. 
 "Life is less formal then it used to be," Sander says. "We have freed ourselves of constraints and become open to fashion's new dynamic elements," she added, referring to her successful sportswear line that is made from Italian fabrics and produced in Italy. 
 Sportswear will continue to be a major part of Sander's menswear collection but she still holds out for classic formal wear. "I still believe in the classic tailor-made suit which will never loose its basic importance in men's fashion." 
 As a former project leader on Sander's menswear collection, Roberto Menichetti is presently putting the Italian touch to men's sportswear at the English luxury goods label Burberry. Since becoming creative director in 1998, Menichetti has given the classic label a sharp new edge. 
 Menichetti, who says neckties will soon be a thing of the past, wants to do away with conventional dressing and is more than keen to do it with sportswear, albeit as elegantly as possible. 
 Speaking from the family's mill in Tuscany, where the Burberry menswear line is produced, Menichetti said: "The new generation of managers and professionals needs to move on to a new style of fashion that makes them feel free but maintains their elegance. If this means sportswear, then I believe this is the only way forward." 
 LUCIE MUIR is a free-lance writer based in Milan. 
SINCE you're already rereading ''Stuart Little,'' do yourself a favor and reread another E. B. White masterpiece, ''The Trumpet of the Swan'' (Harper & Row, 1970). Mr. White's perfect sentences are alive and well. (''Almost everything delights a chickadee.'') And so, thankfully, are trumpeter swans, the largest waterfowl in North America and one of conservation's great success stories.
By the early 1930's, when the count had dropped to about 70 in the United States, trumpeter swans were almost as rare as whooping cranes because they had been hunted for food and fashion (the feathers for hats, the skins for powder puffs). Cooperation between the United States and Canada helped save the swan. Previously unknown remnant populations were discovered in Alaska and northwestern Canada. Habitat protection and restrictions on hunting and on poisonous lead shot have brought trumpeters back from the edge of extinction to a Rocky Mountain population of more than 2,500 and an Alaska-Pacific Coast population of perhaps 15,000, according to the Trumpeter Swan Society, www.taiga.net/swans/mission.html.
The nonprofit society, founded in 1968, is based in Maple Plain, Minn., and publishes two newsletters, Trumpetings (which appears online) and North American Swans. Its site has information on the history, diet and identification of the swans, which have a wingspan of more than seven feet and a height of about four feet.
The site also has a link to a thorough overview of the swans from the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources, on an Adobe Acrobat file, at www.taiga.net/swans/g3647.pdf. The overview, as well as other papers available through the society, will help a reader distinguish the trumpeter swan from its cousin, the tundra swan (formerly known as the whistling swan). It is sometimes hard to do if you cannot hear them. If you have Real Player, you can hear a trumpeter swan at www.wpt.org /getreal!/300/swans/swans.htm.
A smaller but active trumpeter organization is the Trumpeter Swan Sentinel Society, based in Courtenay, British Columbia (www.vquest.com /swan). The society has an annual festival in February to mark the nearby wintering of some 2,000 trumpeters in the Comox Valley on Vancouver Island.
For New Yorkers and nearby residents, the local swans are probably mute swans. They were introduced from Europe to grace the ponds of the wealthy and soon muscled into Northeastern coastal regions.
''Mute swans are not highly regarded by most bird conservationists,'' said Dr. Jeffrey Wells, director of bird conservation for the National Audubon Society of New York State. ''They're such big birds, they're very capable of moving other birds out of the way.''
Mute swans have orange bills and hold their necks in an S-curve; trumpeter swans have black bills and straighter necks. Mute swans are occasionally considered a pest, but a check with New York and federal health authorities turned up no reports of diseases transmitted by them.
Dr. Wells is stationed at the Cornell Laboratory of Ornithology, which, along with the Audubon Society, co-sponsors the BirdSource program (birdsource.cornell.edu). BirdSource has online maps of a huge number of species, by territory, abundance and sightings locations, from the early 1900's to the present.
Trumpeter swans have been reintroduced to several sites in the Midwest and central Canada, and the Trumpeter Swan Society has accounts of those efforts. Wildlife managers would like to see them farther east, wild and free, but there is a problem: since Eastern trumpeter populations became extinct, there have been no adult birds to show cygnets the flyway. Some years ago, scientists discovered that swans will follow an ultralight airplane. (The same thing has been tried on Canada geese and whooping cranes.)
An account of one such program is at www3.sympatico.ca/trumpeter .swan. It traces the successful 1997-98 effort to condition a group of trumpeters to migrate 700 to 800 miles with an ultralight from Ontario to a refuge in southern Indiana. Wayne Bezner Kerr, project leader of the nonprofit Migratory Bird Research Group in Guelph, Ontario, wrote by e-mail that the swans returned to Sudbury, Ontario, last year unassisted. ''More spectacularly,'' he wrote, ''they returned after being on their own for at least two months'' and without any reports of having approached humans for help.
''Last month we had some sightings that suggested the birds had moved south again,'' he wrote. If he can get the financing, he hopes to establish 30 cygnets taken from Alaska on a migration route between upper New York State and the Atlantic coast near Chesapeake Bay.
Claiborne Cary
Algonquin Hotel
Claiborne Cary is a dangerous woman. The 60-something pop-jazz singer can take a seemingly innocent song like ''Charade,'' Johnny Mercer and Henry Mancini's breezy title tune from the 1963 Cary Grant-Audrey Hepburn movie, slice it apart with her scalpel of a voice and reveal its essence to be a cynical, self-mocking statement about romantic game-playing and the difficulty of discerning truthfulness in relationships.
With the possible exception of Elaine Stritch (who rarely appears in nightclubs), no cabaret performer goes harder at a song than Ms. Cary, whose insistent yawp of a voice is the kind of sound that can be heard rising like a sour trumpet above the din of a very wet cocktail party. The surprise comes when that bullying shout breaks into a softer swinging voice with a vibrato that conveys an unexpected tenderness.
The singer, who is appearing at the Oak Room at the Algonquin Hotel, Thursdays through Saturdays through next week, favors material that fits the persona of a funny, angry woman who has stayed too long at the party. Her signature song remains ''Something Cool,'' the June Christy-identified jazz ballad that Ms. Cary delivers as the half-spoken monologue of a barfly deep in her cups, whose harangue drives away a friendly stranger. Ms. Cary squeezes every drop of mordant humor out of Murray Grand's ''Too Old to Die Young,'' the defiant proclamation of an older person who refuses to stop smoking, drinking, taking drugs and picking up strangers.
Beneath Ms. Cary's tough facade, an embattled romanticism peeks through in her versions of ''Angel Eyes,'' ''All the Way'' and ''At Long Last Love.'' Still, the final impression Ms. Cary leaves is of the kind of person who insists on telling you the truth whether you want to hear it or not. STEPHEN HOLDEN
AFTER four years of often rancorous debate and seemingly endless technical discussions on flow rates and drainage issues, approval appears close for the construction by Donald J. Trump of a new 18-hole golf course and clubhouse on the site of the existing Briar Hall Golf and Country Club.
This would be Mr. Trump's first construction project in Westchester County, where he has two other golf course proposals now pending and a third in the planning stage.
In addition to the one here, he has another proposal pending for Seven Springs, a 215-acre estate that straddles the borders of the towns of Bedford, North Castle and New Castle in northern Westchester, and one for 175 acres he owns along the Taconic State Parkway in the French Hill section of Yorktown. Both are now undergoing environmental impact reviews.
For the moment, though, the Trump Organization is relishing its first real victory in Westchester.
Mr. Trump said that the Jan. 10 meeting of the Briarcliff Manor Village Board at which it took action on two key parts of his golf course plan was the end of an ''extremely tough process.''
Near midnight, the board voted 4 to 1 to approve two zoning changes critical to the construction of the new course and clubhouse. He will now be allowed to expand the size of the existing golf course to 147 acres from its present 144 acres (a change that will allow the new course to have a total yardage of 7,200, rather than the existing 6,300) and to demolish the 65,000-square-foot clubhouse. However, he will be required to replace it with a 42,000-square-foot clubhouse and he has opted for a white clapboard and fieldstone building.
''Those zoning changes were essential in order for this project to happen,'' said Keith Austin, the village mayor, ''but this isn't the end of the process. There are still some remaining issues. We need to approve the site plan and the Trump Organization has to submit a tree preservation plan for our approval. But the recent vote covered the most difficult issues, and the project should move ahead from here.''
The new Briarcliff Manor course will be a par-72, Mr. Trump said, and will be called the Trump National Golf Club, adding that fees would be around $150,000 a year. Membership will be capped at 350, Mayor Austin said.
''We insisted on that,'' he stressed, ''and there will be a social membership of another 100. But they would just be allowed to use the clubhouse.''
IN 1987, under previous ownership, the site had been approved for 87 home sites, which Mr. Trump still plans to build, but possibly at a much later date. ''We plan to start construction on the course in about three months,'' he said, ''then we'll start on the clubhouse once the course is completed.''
Mr. Trump indicated he was in no hurry to complete the residential component. ''I may not build that for a long time,'' he said, because he wanted to concentrate on the golf course. As now envisioned, there will eventually be 71 apartments in two buildings -- one 4 stories, the other 3 -- adjacent to the clubhouse. The remaining 16 units will be two- and three-bedroom town houses to be built near the clubhouse.
At one time, Mr. Trump wanted to build 57 town houses, but the village was concerned about the houses being too close to existing residential streets, which surround the golf club.
Mr. Trump said he had to make many concessions during the review process for both Briarcliff Manor and Seven Springs, both of which have been in the works for about four years.
For example, he had to reduce the size of the replacement clubhouse here from 81,500 square feet to 42,000.
At one time, he had planned to build nine houses at Seven Springs, but he has now reduced the figure to one. And he planned to offer championship play at the golf course there, but had to abandon those plans as well because of community opposition to the heavy traffic that tournaments would generate.
After years of high-profile building projects in both Manhattan and Atlantic City, Mr. Trump said that he found building in Westchester challenging on several fronts.
''First of all, there's no land, or very little available,'' he said. ''And the approval process takes a very long time. I think it's the toughest place to build on the planet.''
NEVERTHELESS, Mr. Trump said that he was continuing to look at additional properties in the county and the general area. In late 1998, he purchased 175 acres in Yorktown and 315 acres on the Westchester/Putnam border, mostly in Putnam Valley, for golf projects.
Dino Bradley, Mr. Trump's vice president for project development, said that a draft environmental impact statement was now being reviewed by Yorktown, and ''we're now preparing an environmental impact statement for the Putnam property, but it's very early to talk about that yet.''
The most onerous project to date has been Seven Springs, where Mr. Trump plans to build an 18-hole golf course and convert a 38,000-square-foot mansion into a clubhouse. The property is particularly troublesome since it involves three towns.
As a result, it is the first project in the county ever to be evaluated by an agency representing all three towns. At one time, Mr. Trump planned to subdivide the property into nine building sites, but has since dropped eight of them, effectively taking New Castle out of the reviewing process since the dropped sites were all in that town.
Now down to Bedford and North Castle, the two-town agency will hold a public hearing on Thursday to review the Trump Organization's revised final environmental impact statement.
North Castle is on record as approving the golf course, but Bedford still has some remaining concerns, mostly about traffic and runoff into Byram Lake, which supplies drinking water to Mount Kisco.
''Since this is a revised document, there shouldn't be too many questions remaining,'' said Hugh McMillan, chairman of the Bedford Zoning Board. ''Basically, we will be determining whether the statement is complete.''
After the environmental review is complete, Mr. McMillan added, the two-town agency will disband and each municipality will have to pick up the approval process from there.
''Each municipality will have to vote separately on all future questions, such as granting special permits and other steps as they come up,'' Mr. McMillan said. ''There's still a long way to go.''
Mr. Trump said that he hoped to get all the necessary approvals by the summer.
Donald J. Trump won a round yesterday in his long-running battle over a state-financed road and tunnel project that he thinks would give rival Mirage Resorts Inc. an unfair advantage over the Trump Marina, one of three Atlantic City casinos Trump Hotels and Casino Resorts Inc. owns.
A state appeals court said Mr. Trump had legitimate concerns about the impact of the Atlantic City-Brigantine Connector on his casino and said he could request a hearing. Mr. Trump called it ''a great victory for us and all of Atlantic City.''
James A. Crawford, executive director of the South Jersey Transportation Authority, which is helping the state finance the project, said the ruling would not delay completion of the project. Construction on the 2.2-mile connector between the Atlantic City Expressway and the marina district began in November 1998.
The 13-page ruling set a March 9 deadline for the State Department of Environmental Protection's approval of final plans for the roadway's ramps. The $330 million project is being paid for by the state and Mirage, which plans a $1 billion casino in the marina district.
Philip Jones, a leading British trumpeter and a music educator, died on Jan. 17. He was 71 and lived in London and Switzerland.
Mr. Jones was born in Bath, England, into a family of brass musicians. He began playing the trumpet as a boy, and in 1944 he won a scholarship to the Royal College of Music. At 20 he was appointed fourth trumpet in the Covent Garden orchestra, rising to principal the next year.
He was then, remarkably, principal trumpet with most of the other major London orchestras in succession: the Royal Philharmonic (1956-60), the Philharmonia (1960-64), the Philharmonic (1964-65), the New Philharmonia (1965-67) and the BBC Symphony (1967-71). During his career he played under most of the great conductors, from Erich Kleiber to Pierre Boulez.
During these years he was also performing regularly with a group he had founded in 1951, the quintet known as the Philip Jones Brass Ensemble, to which he was able to give his full attention after 1971. The ensemble played Baroque music, especially pieces by Giovanni Gabrieli and Johann Pezel, and as the early-music revival grew in the 1960's and 70's the group was much in demand for performances of choral music by Monteverdi and others. But the ensemble also commissioned works from composers like Hans Werner Henze, Richard Rodney Bennett and Toru Takemitsu.
As a soloist, too, Mr. Jones lent his brilliance and beauty of tone to new music, like Iain Hamilton's ''Circus'' for two trumpets and orchestra (1969), written for him and his colleague, Elgar Howarth.
In 1986 he retired from playing and devoted his energies to what had been a secondary career, teaching. Two years later he was appointed principal of Trinity College of Music, London, an institution that was then in the doldrums. He invigorated it to a point where it could reclaim equal status with the Royal Academy of Music and the Royal College. He retired in 1994 and the next year took on the chairmanship of the Musicians Benevolent Fund, the leading British musical charity.
He is survived by his wife, Ursula.
Political consultants, pollsters and commentators like to nurse the impression that political outcomes are highly predictable along proven analytical lines, and sometimes they are. For example, a Democratic presidential candidate with A.F.L.-C.I.O. backing is very hard to defeat in the Iowa caucuses, as Bill Bradley wishes he had remembered.
But even beyond upset-prone New Hampshire, there is a wild-card factor in presidential politics that is much harder to predict, and that has to do with the mysterious chemistry that develops between certain candidates and those in the electorate usually referred to as swing or crossover voters. They may be true independents or people with wobbly party loyalty. They may be reacting to hard times, war or a political crisis like Watergate or simply feeling an inchoate longing for a leader who seems new, trustworthy or just different.
From time to time, a candidate pops up who can get votes even from people who understand that they disagree with the candidate on specific issues or even broad ideology. In 1976 Jimmy Carter, with his promise never to lie, ran strongly among independents and soft Republicans offended by Watergate and among working-class Democrats in the North who thought their party had drifted too far to the left.
Four years later, those same culturally conservative Democrats had become Reagan Democrats. Ronald Reagan won the presidency in 1980 by cutting deeply into such traditional Democratic blocs as union members and urban Catholics. Mr. Reagan is remembered as the classic example of the candidate with supra-ideological appeal, and that is why John McCain paid a visit this week to Macomb County, Mich., a Reagan blue-collar stronghold, to appeal openly for independent and Democratic support. ''That's the way you lead the country,'' he said.
It is also, handily, the way to defeat a primary opponent who is favored by the party establishment. A party's Congressional leadership and its governors seldom, if ever, favor insurgents who try to flood their primaries with independents and crossovers. In 1976, establishment Democrats ginned up the Anybody But Carter movement. In 1980 Northeastern and Beltway Republicans tried to lure former President Gerald Ford out of retirement to stop Mr. Reagan, whom they regarded as an unelect able extremist.
But one of the greatest upsets of a seemingly inevitable nominee came in 1952, when Dwight Eisenhower defeated ''Mr. Republican,'' Robert Taft. In that campaign, Peter G. Peterson, the New York investment banker who became Commerce Secretary in 1972, was polling and interviewing voters for a group called Citizens for Eisenhower. The interviews, he recalled, showed that with Eisenhower, ''there was something there that transcended the issues. The stuff on Eisenhower would come pouring out: 'That's a guy I really like.' 'I trust him.' 'I really think he'd do the right thing.' ''
''I wrote up a memo,'' Mr. Peterson recalled, ''that talked about the transcendent importance of character and trust and how it was a far better strategy for Dwight Eisenhower to build on that than get on overly gritty nuances of his positions and Taft's positions, because he was seen as a transcendent figure that people trusted.''
It is too early to know whether Mr. McCain can sail above the issues with a modern approximation of Ike's father-figure appeal. Mr. McCain is a hotter and, potentially, a more divisive presence than Eisenhower was in 1952. Yesterday George W. Bush's surrogates were condemning Mr. McCain as hotheaded and disloyal for airing commercials that accuse Mr. Bush of Clintonesque dishonesty.
One danger for Mr. McCain is that he could wind up looking too liberal for G.O.P. voters and too conservative or overly abrasive to independents and crossover Democrats he needs. There can be other pitfalls as well for candidates who run as true outsiders. ''McCain doesn't quite say if I ever lie to you, don't vote for me, but he says something like that,'' says Jody Powell, who was Mr. Carter's press secretary. ''He should remember that if you say that, the press will hold you to it and decide that it is all right for all the other candidates to lie since they never promised not to.''
Another kind of expectation game is, however, working in Mr. McCain's favor. Designated nominees are expected to operate with a tough professionalism and steady competence that Mr. Bush has not projected since he got tagged in New Hampshire. A defeat in South Carolina could be an irremediable blow to his standing with a Republican establishment whose support came to him so early and easily.
IT'S halftime at the Nokia Sugar Bowl. The crowd quiets down as a randomly chosen fan, Robert Moderhak, a 54-year-old retired school administrator, walks onto the field to try winning $500,000 by throwing a football through a 2-foot-square target 15 feet away.
A loud chant begins in the stadium. ''Go! Go!'' Among those cheering the loudest are executives of Nokia, the sponsor.
The only people not rooting for Mr. Moderhak are from SCA Promotions of Dallas, which, for a $50,000 fee from Nokia, took the risk that the fan could beat the odds.
As it turns out, SCA bet wrong and, after Mr. Moderhak's pass sailed through the target, paid up. But when Robert D. Hamman, SCA's founder and chief executive, heard the news, he barely winced. Even the best oddsmakers miss some of the time.
Mr. Hamman does not miss often. SCA, which stands for Sports Contest Association, has paid out $65 million in prizes since its founding in 1986. But that amount is less than 1 percent of the $10 billion it has underwritten. Revenues vary widely from year to year, but are, on average, slightly more than twice the payouts, Mr. Hamman said.
''To have a viable business, we need winners,'' Mr. Hamman explained. ''But what we really root for are close misses, because the customer thinks it was almost going to happen, and yet we didn't have to reach for our checkbook.''
The excitement over TV game shows like ''Who Wants to Be a Millionaire,'' he said, has made more companies want to offer bigger promotional contests without increasing their financial risk. That is part of the reason he expects SCA's revenues to grow by one-third this year -- to $37 million. The company is privately held; Mr. Hamman owns slightly more than 50 percent.
His Dallas office is teeming with fresh-faced account executives who call him ''Bob'' and have the air of the contestants in the contests he underwrites -- after they win. ''The cornerstone of our business is that our clients pay us a fixed fee, regardless of the outcome of the contest,'' he said. ''Even those who can afford to pay the cost of the prize they're offering do not want to have to worry about whether it's a smart thing to do.''
Analyzing odds is something Mr. Hamman has done well since at least the age of 18. That is when he began playing bridge. Now, at 61, he is a 10-time world champion bridge player, and is currently the top-ranked player in the world.
Warren E. Buffett, who has played with him in regional bridge tournaments, has become an admirer. ''He can watch a basketball game and eat a sandwich at the same time he's playing and still know precisely what he's doing,'' Mr. Buffett said.
With his loud, striped, open-neck shirts and disarming laugh, Mr. Hamman looks and acts less the bridge-playing mathematician than a Las Vegas high-roller. Many other executives cultivate gray blandness, but, as Mr. Buffett said, ''he comes in Technicolor.''
Born in Pasadena, Calif., Mr. Hamman recounts in his autobiography and bridge guide, ''At the Table,'' (DBM Publications), how, at the age of 5, he won money playing in his father's poker games. His education in figuring odds came from extensive math courses at Occidental College, U.C.L.A. and California State University at Northridge. He was so busy playing cards, he says, that he never earned a degree. In 1969, he moved to Dallas to join a bridge team competing for the world title, which it won the next year.
In 1986, at the age of 47 and with his own insurance brokerage firm, he was asked to underwrite a hole-in-one golf contest. After years of responding to acts of God or nature, he said, he liked the challenge of analyzing a created risk and decided to start a business.
This year, SCA, with the backing of other investors, or underwriters, will support 5,000 promotions, including radio and TV contests, scratch-and-win games and lottery and casino jackpots. Mr. Hamman prefers contests with pure mathematical odds, like many casino games, but he will take a chance on almost anything. For years, he covered a $50,000 prize to be given to any member of the World Pumpkin Growing Federation who grew a 1,000-pound pumpkin. He paid up in 1996, when a grower produced a winner the size of a Volkswagen.
He can tell the odds of a basketball fan's sinking a shot from half-court: 1 in 25. And the odds of a golf hole-in-one: 1 in 6,500, on a 175-yard hole. When SCA agreed to underwrite a Memphis radio station's $1 million ''Find Elvis Alive'' contest -- requiring the winner to produce the King's current dental records -- Mr. Hamman put the odds at less than 1 percent. The fee was $2,000.
''Often a sponsor will say to me: 'This will never happen. The fee should be really cheap,' '' Mr. Hammon recounted. ''And I'll say: 'In that case why are we discussing it? Tell me how it came out.' '' SCA's fees usually range from 2 to 20 percent of the prize value, depending on the risk.
Mr. Hamman rarely has a sleepless night. That, however, was not always the case.
In 1989, SCA, for a $25,000 fee, underwrote a contract for American Express and Best Western Hotels to pay $250,000 to Little League Baseball if Nolan Ryan of the Texas Rangers pitched a no-hitter that season.
''Ryan was 42 at the time,'' Mr. Hamman recalled. ''There had never been a pitcher in the history of baseball at age 42 to pitch a no-hitter. The previous season he'd been pitching in the Astrodome,'' for the Houston Astros, ''and now he'd be pitching outside in the Dallas heat.
''We thought he was no threat whatsoever, so anything we got paid was a gift. Soon after, I'm listening to the game and Ryan is dominating it, and I'm thinking, 'God, this is a lot scarier than I thought.' Several times that season, he reached the eighth and ninth innings with no-hitters. The real problem was that it was a nationally visible promotion that our underwriters signed off on, and they're opening up the newspaper each morning seeing what an idiot Bob is.''
Ryan did not pitch a no-hitter that year, but he did the next two years. ''We weren't involved in those,'' Mr. Hamman said with a smile.
Donald J. Trump has decided to end his brief and flamboyant exploration of a run for president, concluding that the Reform Party, whose support he had sought, was so beset by internal fighting that he would have no chance of winning the White House as its nominee, his associates said last night.
Mr. Trump will officially announce his decision in a television interview this morning, according to someone close to him. In a formal statement that is scheduled to be released today, he denounced the divisions that have beset the Reform Party in recent months, which he described as ''general fratricide.''
Mr. Trump's decision came one day after a Reform Party faction backed by Ross Perot, which strongly opposed the prospect of Mr. Trump as the party's presidential candidate, ousted a faction aligned with Gov. Jesse Ventura of Minnesota, who was close to Mr. Trump. Mr. Ventura quit the national party on Friday, calling it ''dysfunctional.''
Although it is risky to offer any predictions concerning the Reform Party, the latest round of maneuvering seemed all but fatal to any hope Mr. Trump had of filling the position Mr. Perot had held in the 1992 and 1996 presidential elections.
Mr. Trump asserted in his statement that he believed he could win the party's nomination if he chose to pursue it. But, he said, ''the prospect of divisive lawsuits, continued fighting over the national convention site and general fratricide'' had convinced him that the Reform Party nominee, whoever it may be, would have no chance of victory.
''I have consistently stated that I would spend my time, energy and money on a campaign, not just to get a large number of votes, but to win,'' Mr. Trump said in the statement. ''There would be no other purpose, other than winning, for me to run. I have therefore decided not to seek the presidential nomination of the Reform Party.''
Mr. Trump's imminent departure would appear to leave Patrick J. Buchanan, the conservative commentator, as the leading prospect to win the Reform Party's backing -- providing that Mr. Perot does not decide to make a third go at it.
Mr. Trump's decision, which was described by his friend as final and unequivocal, ends what had been one of the stranger episodes of the 2000 presidential race. Before six months ago, Mr. Trump had never shown any interest in electoral politics, instead building a large reputation as a developer, casino operator and, by his own boast, skilled publicity seeker and accomplished womanizer.
The new interim head of the Reform Party, Pat Choate, described Mr. Trump as a ''hustler'' last night, and said he had never believed that Mr. Trump had any interest beyond promoting himself and a new book that happened to be published at exactly the time he started his light schedule of campaign travel.
''Donald Trump came in, promoted his hotels, he promoted his book, he promoted himself at our expense, and I think he understands very fully that we've ended the possibilities for such abuse of our party,'' Mr. Choate said. ''We're taking our party back to our very principles, and exploiters such as Donald Trump will not be able to exploit us again -- and he realizes it.''
''We saw no evidence that he was a serious candidate at all,'' Mr. Choate said. ''All this was, was a serious hustle of the media, and I think the media should send him a massive bill on it.''
Mr. Trump apparently anticipated such speculation -- which, in fact, is fairly common in political circles -- and in his statement went out of his way to say that this was more than a frolic. ''For those who suggest that this has just been a promotion, I want to strongly deny that,'' he said.
He said that although his book and his businesses had probably benefited from the exposure his campaign generated, ''I did not launch my exploratory campaign for that reason.''
Mr. Trump painted a fairly dark picture of the Reform Party in his statement, noting the role of Mr. Buchanan, along with the roles of David Duke, a former leader of the Ku Klux Klan, and Lenora Fulani, the former standard-bearer of the New Alliance Party and an advocate of Marxist-Leninist politics.
''The Reform Party now includes a Klansman, Mr. Duke, a neo-Nazi, Mr. Buchanan, and a communist, Ms. Fulani,'' he said in his statement. ''This is not company I wish to keep.''
Mr. Trump reached his final decision after meeting with advisers at his estate in West Palm Beach before flying back to New York this evening. Although Mr. Ventura said he was forming his own new Independence Party, Mr. Trump said he would not seek its nomination for president.
At La Guardia Airport last night, Mr. Trump told reporters that he might make a decision soon about which candidate he would endorse. He lamented the loss of Mr. Ventura, calling him ''the star of the party.''
Donald J. Trump is ending his brief and flamboyant exploration of a run for president, concluding that the Reform Party, whose support he had sought, is so beset by internal fighting that he would have no chance of winning as its nominee, the developer's associates said.

To the Editor:
Donald J. Trump says that he didn't pursue a race for the presidency because ''my lawyers told me that [it] was unlikely'' that the Reform Party candidate would be able to get into the debates Op-Ed, Feb. 19. But the hallmark of a serious independent reformer is the willingness to lead the fight in the constant legal battles for access to the ballot and access to candidate debates.
The independent political movement is slowly but steadily gaining ground in a prolonged fight against the two-party system. It does not need a ''reformer'' telling us he's going to sit in the audience until round 15, and then jump into the ring to throw one punch and claim the championship.
ARTHUR R. BLOCK
New York, Feb. 19, 2000
With two more primary victories under his belt, Senator John McCain campaigned across the Northwest today with restored confidence, proclaiming himself a ''proud, pro-life conservative Republican'' yet continuing his appeals to Democrats, independents, young people and minorities.
''The party of Abraham Lincoln,'' he told a group of college students today, ''is a party of addition, and not division.''
Mr. McCain repeatedly aimed his appeals at two fronts in a series of events across Washington State, one of three states with Republican primaries next Tuesday.
Concerned about his weak support among conservatives, he underscored his commitment to cherished Republican positions like reducing government spending, opposing abortion and strengthening the military. But, delighted with his backing from Democrats and independents, Mr. McCain reminded large, enthusiastic audiences of his terrifying experiences as a prisoner of war in Vietnam and of his ''crusade'' to show young people that public service is an honorable undertaking.
''The great thing about this victory yesterday,'' he said at Gonzaga University in Spokane, ''was we have proved -- I hope to my Republican friends, and I believe to most Americans -- that we can reassemble a coalition, a coalition that reaches out across party lines, preserving our core with conservative Republican principles and yet attracting to our banner people who are independents, people who are Democrats, libertarians, vegetarians.''
For his part, Gov. George W. Bush of Texas reached out to a wider audience than he normally does, visiting a privately financed social service center that helps provide food, clothing and educational assistance to people in inner-city Los Angeles. The Dream Center, as it is called, is a model for the governor's efforts to encourage private, faith-based involvement in social services.
Mr. Bush later held a news conference in which he belittled Mr. McCain's appeal during his victory speech for Republicans to support his campaign. ''I was amazed last night to hear my opponent is reaching out to Republicans,'' he said. 'It's an amazing admission to make.''
Mr. Bush also blamed the ''liberal Democratic vote'' for his eight-point loss in Michigan, and suggested that the Democrats who voted for Mr. McCain had tried to ''hijack the primary to help Al Gore.''
The governor added: ''I didn't anticipate that nearly 20 percent of the Republican primary would be made up of, in many cases, liberal Democrats. I don't think anybody did. The only thing we need to do is rally our base and rally our support.''
In his speeches today, Mr. McCain largely avoided mentioning Mr. Bush, instead aiming his fire at President Clinton and Vice President Al Gore, just as Mr. Bush did after winning the South Carolina primary on Saturday.
But in interviews with reporters, Mr. McCain and his aides tried to pin Mr. Bush to the far right. Rarely did they utter Mr. Bush's name without mentioning his support from social conservatives like Pat Robertson and the Rev. Jerry Falwell, or Mr. Bush's campaign appearance earlier this month at Bob Jones University in South Carolina.
Mr. McCain left open the possibility that his campaign would continue to place phone calls telling Roman Catholic voters that Bob Jones has made a series of anti-Catholic remarks. On Tuesday, as voters cast ballots in Michigan, Mr. Bush complained bitterly that people were receiving such calls, but the McCain campaign denied any involvement.
Only late Tuesday night did the campaign acknowledge making such calls, a point that Mr. Bush made today. ''They admitted they were making those calls,'' he said. ''I don't accept that kind of campaign. And I don't appreciate it one bit.''
Although Mr. McCain has repeatedly promised not to run negative advertisements, he defended the phone calls today when he spoke to reporters on his campaign plane. ''That was an accurate phone call,'' he said, jabbing the air for emphasis. ''I didn't call anybody a bigot.''
He was alluding to phone calls that Mr. Robertson, a Bush supporter, made to voters in Michigan in which he characterized former Senator Warren B. Rudman of New Hampshire, a McCain supporter, as a ''vicious bigot.''
Yet just below the swagger, there was a palpable sense of relief in the McCain campaign. The magnitude of the loss in South Carolina last week had been stomach-churning, aides said, and Michigan had been viewed as a must-win state, which perhaps explains Mr. McCain's first reaction upon hearing himself declared the victor of Michigan on television.
''Phew,'' he said.
Mr. McCain flew first to Spokane today and then to Seattle, riding a crest of new enthusiasm and campaign contributions over the Internet. In Spokane, several hundred people stood outside the Gonzaga student union building because it was packed to capacity. When Mr. McCain waded though the crowd, people surged toward him, seeking his handshake or his autograph on campaign signs, books, newspapers, T-shirts and, inexplicably, a volume of Washington State statutes.
In Bremerton, a working-class town built around a naval shipyard on the edge of Puget Sound, more than 5,000 people showed up tonight for a McCain rally, one of the largest turnouts of any McCain campaign event. Hundreds of people waited as long as four hours, and when he departed after a brief speech in freezing rain several dozen people surrounded his bus and pounded on the windows to get his attention.
''You know what this is like?'' asked Cindy McCain, the candidate's wife, ''it's like traveling with Mick Jagger.''
McCain strategists said today that one key to shoring up support from Republicans would be forceful reminders of Mr. McCain's conservative voting record on a wide range of economic and social issues.
''We have to do a better job of connecting the dots, and we will,'' said a senior strategist, John Weaver. ''We have to remind Republicans of John McCain's life history, his record, his ties to Reagan.''
To the Editor:
Re ''What I Saw at the Revolution'' (Op-Ed, Feb. 19): I question Donald J. Trump's knowledge of the issues when he says that Gov. George W. Bush's and Vice President Al Gore's ''issue positions seemed virtually indistinguishable.'' Mr. Trump ignores such topics as a woman's right to choose and the protection of the environment. But perhaps Mr. Trump considers these unimportant.
CONSTANCE T. LATSON
Greenport, N.Y., Feb. 19, 2000
The news that the jury had reached a verdict in the trial of the death of Amadou Diallo was first reported on New York 1 News late yesterday afternoon, but moments later all the major cable news channels and most of the city's local stations dropped their programming to tune to the reading of the verdict.
These stations -- WCBS, WABC, WNBC and New York 1, as well as CNN, MSNBC and Fox News -- covered the verdict from its initial announcement in the courtroom just before 5 p.m. While the officers' faces crumbled with what might be described as respectful gratitude, WNYW, the Fox affiliate on Channel 5, ran reruns of ''The Nanny'' and ''Third Rock From the Sun.''
John Verrelli, WNYW's associate news director, said that other stations -- WWOR, the UPN affiliate on Channel 9, and WPIX, the WB affiliate on Channel 11 -- also decided against carrying all of the live verdict. ''We did a cut-in and did the verdict and the reaction,'' he said, ''and then went back to normal programming because there was nothing happening at that point.''
All the New York affiliate stations were ready with reporters stationed in the Soundview section of the Bronx, where Mr. Diallo died a little more than a year ago. But although reporters anticipated the possibility of riots, they instead found a few angry citizens willing to be interviewed on live television, along with police officers. And as one WCBS correspondent characterized the scene, ''at least 50 percent of the people'' -- at the intersection near Mr. Diallo's apartment building -- ''are members of the media.''
Many of the reporters covering the verdict in Albany echoed Scott Weinberger, the WNBC correspondent who spoke of ''the unbelievable tension in the courtroom'' as the verdict was read. John Noel, also a correspondent for WNBC, described the scene on the street outside the courthouse as ''a very angry group of people out there.''
But for every possible incendiary report from Albany or the Bronx, it appeared as if station news directors wanted to temper it with analysis from legal experts not affiliated with the case. After Mr. Noel reported that a chanting mob was holding up wallets in angry protest -- a reference to the wallet Mr. Diallo was holding when he was shot, which officers mistakenly perceived as a handgun -- WNBC switched to a studio discussion with a lawyer, Robert Tarver, about whether there was a specific need for legislation regarding police conduct.
More than a few times in the first hour of reporting, local news correspondents were forced to ask people in the street to leave the air after they began to use obscenities. New York 1 allowed one particularly angry Bronx man to vent his frustrations for several minutes, saying that he wanted to kill all police officers and that all police officers are racist.
''Never a cop go to jail for murdering a black man in 100 years,'' he screamed.
In contrast to the local channels, the verdict carried less weight on the network news broadcasts. It was not the lead story on ABC's ''World News Tonight,'' and while it was the first story on ''NBC Nightly News'' and ''The CBS Evening News,'' CBS did not have a reporter in Albany.
Six weeks remain in the regular season, but the Rangers and Buffalo Sabres played tonight as if it were a deciding game in a Stanley Cup playoff series.
In a wildly, entertaining match with end-to-end rushes, the Rangers rallied from a two-goal deficit in the second period to score five straight goals and skate to an improbable 6-3 victory.
The victory -- the Rangers' first against Buffalo since Dec. 13, 1996, snapping a 0-8-4 slump -- enabled the Rangers to both pull 3 points ahead of the Sabres in the Eastern Conference standing and into a seventh-place tie with Pittsburgh with 64 points.
The Rangers finally solved the world's top goaltender, Dominik Hasek. Petr Nedved was the Rangers' most accurate sharpshooter, scoring a hat trick, the last goal going into an empty net with 1 minute 11 seconds remaining. Nedved's third three-goal game of the season matched the hat trick of Buffalo's Michael Peca.
Entering the game, Hasek was 7-0-3 against the Rangers in his last 10 games, shutting them out five of the last seven during a span of more than three years.
Not tonight.
''It just looked like maybe he was a little sore,'' Rangers Coach John Muckler said of Hasek, who has missed 40 games this season with a groin injury. ''He wasn't moving naturally to me. I thought he was down on the ice quite a bit, more often than you usually see him.''
The Rangers found a way to capitalize. Theo Fleury, Mike York and Alexandre Daigle also scored for the Rangers, who scored three power-play goals for the first time this season.
Fleury tallied his first power-play goal as a Ranger, snapping a 61-game drought -- almost four hours skating with the man advantage. York, a 22-year-old rookie, scored his 20th goal. Daigle scored what turned out to be the game-winner at 5:21 of the final period.
Nedved scored the game's final two goals, including his 20th, which put the game away with 5:59 to play by giving the Rangers a 5-3 lead.
''He seemed to bite on our first move all the time,'' Fleury said of Hasek, ''like he did on Petr's second goal.''
Nedved, who was cruising down left wing on a two-on-one break, faked a pass and held onto the puck. Nedved's shot from off the left post beat Hasek up high. It was only the second time the Rangers had beaten Hasek five times in a game.
The first was Dec. 31, 1992, an 11-6 loss here, in which Mike Richter relieved John Vanbiesbrouck, allowed six goals and took the loss. Tonight, Richter made 22 saves and ensured that no Sabre except Peca would score a goal.
After scoring his 21st goal of the season into an empty net, Nedved said with a laugh, ''That one went between Hasek's legs, I think.''
The Rangers could afford to smile after coming back from a 3-1 deficit that was built courtesy of Peca. The Buffalo captain scored the first hat trick of his National Hockey League career before the game was half over. His terrific performance provided an interesting subplot to the evening. Earlier this week, the 25-year-old center had said he would give up his captaincy if the Sabres acquired Mark Messier from Vancouver.
Even though the Sabres' ownership has directed the front office to pursue a trade for Messier, Vancouver General Manager Brian Burke has long maintained that he will not trade Messier until Messier asks to be traded.
''This thing will transpire the way Mark wants it to happen,'' Burke said this week.
Another plot line was the return of Richter, who had missed the last two games with a sprained left knee and five of the Rangers' nine games since the All-Star Game break. Richter sprained the knee during the All-Star skills competition in Toronto on Feb. 5.
At the other end of the ice was Hasek, who was making his first start of the season against the Rangers. Since returning from a major groin injury, Hasek was 4-0-3 with a 1.23 goals against average, looking every bit as dominating as his nickname, the Dominator, would suggest.
And that, of course, did not bode well for the Rangers, who came in with a 1-23-7 record this season in games in which they had scored two goals or fewer. Who could have guessed that the Rangers would have three goals -- all on the power play -- before the second intermission?
Then again, who would have guessed that Peca would have his first career hat trick well before the second intermission? And the Rangers were extremely fortunate that Peca did not have a fourth goal heading into the third.
Instead, the teams headed into the third period tied at 3-3. Fleury's goal, with 11 seconds remaining in the first period, was his 14th this season and just his third in the last 20 games.
York's goal, at 7:06 of the second, cut the deficit to 3-2. Asked afterward if he ever imagined he would score 20 goals this season, York, who leads N.H.L. rookies in goals, said: ''No. Definitely not. I really wasn't that much of a scorer in college at Michigan State. My senior year, I barely broke 20. It is surprising.''
So was the comeback against Hasek. The Rangers are now 19-0-0 this season in games in which they score four or more goals.
''You're usually shooting at his torso and you didn't see that tonight very often,'' Muckler said. ''He usually plays his angles and spreads his legs. He seems to be set and you're shooting into the main part of his body all the time. I didn't see very much of that tonight. But don't worry. He'll be back.''
The Rangers play host to the Sabres at Madison Square Garden on Wednesday night.
SLAP SHOTS
Veteran defenseman RICH PILON missed his fifth straight game and seventh in the Rangers' last eight with a left rotator cuff strain. Pilon said the shoulder was still weak and he would probably miss Saturday night's game in Ottawa, as well. He is pointing toward a Wednesday return against Buffalo, although Pilon might sit that one out, too, because of the Sabres' team speed and Pilon's lack of it. . . . On Thursday, JASON DOIG, an inexperienced defenseman, accepted a second conditioning stint in Hartford.
WHATEVER happened to ''Asian values?''
With the unexpectedly rapid revival of most of the economies in East Asia, you would think that there would be a lot more talk again in the region about the hardy superiority of Asia's often more authoritarian and centralized approach to fostering economic growth and running governments.
But the avatars of Asian values -- Lee Kuan Yew, the patriarch and former prime minister of Singapore, and Mohathir Mohamad, the prime minister of Malaysia -- who were once so outspoken about the dangers of individualism and the cultural failings of the West, have barely been heard from lately. And few in Asia are listening these days to sermons on ''Asian'' virtues of thrift, strong extended families, personal connections and deference to elders. Instead, the continent has fallen in love with the Internet.
On a recent trip to Tokyo, Shanghai, Hong Kong and Jakarta, I was struck repeatedly by the widespread enthusiasm for doing business on the Web. The mania for the few dot-com stocks aimed at the Asian market is just the most visible sign. More profound is how quickly Asia's leaders are realizing that they can't flourish in the new economy by doing business as usual.
''We have no choice but to adapt an Asian version of the American model of openness and entrepreneurialism,'' said Victor Fung, chairman of the Hong Kong Trade Development Council. ''Fortunately, that's where Hong Kong already has an advantage.''
Yet even in China, where the freewheeling Internet threatens the monolithic power of the Communist Party, the government solidly backs building the infrastructure of a wired economy.
''China needs the Internet more than any other country in the world,'' said Peter Yip, chief executive of China.com, a Hong-Kong company of which the Beijing government is part-owner. ''It's the only way to catch up with the rest of the global economy.''
Indeed, the emergence of the Internet is empowering a new generation of Chinese entrepreneurs and luring home some of China's best and brightest who have been studying and working abroad. One evening in Shanghai, at an upscale Western-style restaurant called M on the Bund, I had dinner with three young Chinese entrepreneurs involved in various online ventures. From our table on the seventh floor of a neoclassical stone office building built by foreigners before World War II, we were able to look across the Huangpu River to dozens of modern glass skyscrapers in the sprawling Pudong industrial and commercial area.
The conversation, ranging from media gossip to contemporary art to business strategies, could as easily have taken place in Manhattan, London or Tokyo. Yes, these Web pioneers represent only a thin slice of a tiny elite, but they are likely to be a wedge that helps open China to the wider world.
''In the United States, I'm just another smart tech guy,'' said Bo Y. Shao, founder and chairman of Eachnet.com, which is trying to introduce a new form of person-to-person e-commerce to China. ''Here in Shanghai, my skills are unique.''
Mr. Shao, 26, a Shanghai-born math whiz, went to Harvard to study, but returned to China last year to build Eachnet from scratch. While he adapts his business model to the vagaries of what is still a primitive economic environment, he is raising money abroad and planning a public offering.
EVEN more than in America, the online explosion in China is a challenge to the Asian business establishment, which has been on the defensive since the Asian financial crisis broke in 1997. In the mainstream economy and to some extent online, many leading businesses -- and some spectacular failures -- are little more than the long shadows of powerful families. Ownership and responsibility is closely held at the top, mostly by fathers, sons and brothers. ''Guanxi,'' or connections that sometimes spill over into corruption, are an essential element of the complex dance between business and government elites.
''Family businesses, crony businesses -- they all have to share power and be restructured to be competitive,'' said Jimmy Lai, chairman of Next Media, a publishing company that is becoming a multimedia content provider and e-commerce vehicle. ''The Internet has democratized business. It will inevitably democratize Asian economies.''
There is a lot of hype associated with Internet ventures in Asia, of course, just as there is in the United States. And there are plenty of places in Indonesia, Malaysia and Thailand where basic development remains frozen and the Web is a distant dream.
Still, as the region resumes its economic race, the idea that Asia is fundamentally different has lost its resonance. The information technology revolution is liberalizing an already liberal West; the more traditional East seems destined for the same.
Individual contests have long been unpopular and are rarely staged, but in a sense they are the purest form of the game. Nobody wins or loses because of sophisticated partnership understandings, and there are no professional-client relationships. In Athens last week, 100 of the world's best players competed by invitation in the fifth Generali Masters Individual, and 10 of the 33 countries participating took home medals. That may seem a strange number, since there were three medals to be won in each of three divisions.
In the Men's Division, first place went to Antonio Sementa of Italy, second to Piotr Gawrys of Poland and third to Aleksandr Gromov of Russia. In the Women's competition, the honors went to Benedicte Cronier of France, Jill Meyers of the United States and Martine Verbeek of the Netherlands. Milton Karamanlis of Greece and Andreas Gloyer of Austria were first and second in the Junior competition, and Kit-Lai of Hong Kong and Kylie Robb of Australia tied for third position.
Eva Haraszimovich of Poland did not win a medal, but she was the only player to make three no-trump on the diagramed deal. She won the opening heart lead with the king and led a club to the king. East won with the ace and returned her remaining heart, on which West played the nine. At double-dummy South should now win with the ace, but that is not practical unless you known that the suit is divided 6-2.
When South allowed the nine to win, West shifted to a diamond. South knew that West had no likely entry, but she was in considerable difficulty. She put up the queen, and East won and returned a diamond. This was ducked to West, who won with the 10, leaving this tricky position:
Diagram
A minor-suit return would have permitted the defense to prevail, but the situation was far from obvious. West tried a spade with fatal results. South put up the 10, which was permitted to win. She cashed the heart ace, putting pressure on East in three suits.
East gave up a spade, which was as good as anything. South discarded a club and cashed three spade tricks, ending in dummy. East gave up. She could not protect both minor suits.
IS it possible for a computer game to have the intellectual heft and emotional impact of a good book while remaining as captivating as a well-paced film? If so, the first candidate may well be Planescape: Torment.
Planescape, a role-playing game, breaks many of the conventions that have distinguished the genre since it emerged two decades ago. Plane scape is not especially difficult, but it is written for ages 13 and older and may be inappropriate for younger children.
The game features poignant storytelling and engaging interaction with digital characters, not to mention a healthy dose of good old-fashioned play. Picking up where path-clearing games like Fallout began, Plane scape could well herald a new wave of games that are valued as much for their artistic merit as they are for their technical brilliance and the fun they offer.
Planescape is like other role-playing games in that the player directs an alter ego, along with a band of companions, through fantastic environments and against fearsome foes as they try to complete their quest. Like some other role-playing games, Planescape is based (loosely) on the rules of Advanced Dungeons and Dragons, the most popular pen-and-paper role-playing game.
That is where most of the similarities to most other games end, both in design and execution.
Most computer role-playing games take place in a medieval fantasy environment, complete with elves, goblins and, of course, dragons. Planescape mostly takes place in the bizarre city of Sigil, a place that sits at the intersection of infinite planes of existence. In the Plane scape multiple universe, ideas are often more powerful than actions, and an entire city can move from one plane to another when the beliefs of its inhabitants change.
Rather than a gleaming hero, the player controls a scarred, shambling figure known only as The Nameless One. Instead of chain mail, he wears magical tattoos for protection. Instead of typically heroic companions, he may be joined by things like a floating skull, a demoness or a disembodied suit of armor, each with its own set of often-disturbing neuroses.
Perhaps the most distinctive aspect of the game's design is that the main character is immortal. That is a boon for most players because death at the hands of a monster or trap is generally only a minor inconvenience in Planescape. In fact, dying is essential to solving at least one of the game's puzzles.
But it turns out that the main character's immortality is actually his biggest problem; the game's story revolves around his quest to discover its cause and annul it so he may finally rest in peace.
Along the way, The Nameless One discovers that at least some of his prior incarnations were deceitful, manipulative cretins who destroyed the lives of relatively innocent beings and who tricked others into sacrificing themselves for his benefit. In the game, the player struggles for redemption, despite the actions of his own earlier incarnations, while wrestling with the unexpected consequences of his immortality.
The game's level of detail and its emotional impact have prompted some players to cast about for literary peers. ''As a piece of literature, it blows away 'Lord of The Rings' for my $34.99,'' wrote one person in an Internet games newsgroup. ''And that was a childhood favorite.'' Planescape, the person wrote, ''fills the same niche for my adult life.''
Referring to the game's lead designer, another person wrote that computer role-playing games ''may not have seen their Shakespeare yet, but I think in Chris Avellone and the rest of his team, and in Planescape, we may have seen the like of Christopher Marlowe and Dr. Faustus.''
In one sense, the literary allusions are apt because most of Plane scape's story is conveyed in text. Planescape has beautiful (if slightly unsettling) graphics, but most of the dialogue and important plot elements are conveyed with words. Planescape includes about a million words of text, but because it includes multiple paths to success, only a fraction of those will be displayed in any particular game.
''Some of the things we were trying to convey would have required 400 or 500 people to achieve graphically,'' Mr. Avellone said. ''It became apparent that we could achieve the same effect with a paragraph of text. When you watch a movie, your imagination is basically being supplied for you, whereas in a book you're creating it yourself. The same thing applied here: What you recreate in your own mind is more powerful than what we can supply for you. Plus, it's just fun to write.''
Perhaps partly because the game is so text-intensive, Planescape's system requirements are fairly low: Windows, a 200-megahertz processor and 32 megabytes of memory.
But perhaps the most important requirement is an ability to think new thoughts about just what a computer game can be.
''There are a lot of intelligent games out there,'' Mr. Avellone said. ''But people who really don't play a whole lot of games, if they just see certain first-person shooters they assume it's all mindless.''
Referring to games from other companies, he added: ''If you look at Final Fantasy 7 or Half-Life or Homeworld, for instance, there are a whole lot of games that aren't mindless at all. So you say, 'Wow, this is making me have certain emotions, this is making me feel a certain way. I'm really enjoying this.' Maybe people should just play more games.''

Jonah Jones, a jazz trumpeter who played with some of the great swing bands and sold a million copies of his versions of ''On the Street Where You Live'' and ''Baubles, Bangles and Beads,'' died on Sunday. He was 91 and lived in Manhattan.
Mr. Jones, who was born in Louisville, Ky., learned to play the trumpet at a community center where he played church music. The day he heard a Louis Armstrong record, he said, his life changed. While still in Louisville, he performed with local bands like Tinsley's Royal Aces and Perdue's Pirates; in 1928 he was hired by the band leader Horace Henderson and worked in the Midwest for a few years.
In 1932 he moved north and joined the violinist Stuff Smith's sextet. He continued changing jobs, appearing with McKinney's Cotton Pickers and Lil Armstrong, Louis Armstrong's wife, among other band leaders. But his first big break came in 1936, with a four-year residency at the Onyx Club secured by Stuff Smith. The band, featuring Smith on electrified violin, was popular, salting its vivid playing with slapstick humor.
After working briefly with Benny Carter and Fletcher Henderson, Mr. Jones became a longtime member of Cab Calloway's group, from 1941 to 1952, seeing the band through its reduction from a big band to a septet to a quartet. (Calloway was an appreciative boss: he recorded a song celebrating Mr. Jones's arrival called ''Jonah Joins the Cab.'')
He staged a midcareer resurgence in the 50's by putting a mute in his horn and familiar pop melodies in his hands. In 1952 Mr. Jones received an offer from the pianist Joe Bushkin to fill in at the Embers, one of New York's 52nd Street jazz clubs. Mr. Jones agreed to put a mute in his horn; this quieter sound was what his predecessor in the band, Buck Clayton, had adopted, and it was what the restaurant preferred. Mr. Jones, whose resume included stints with the society band leaders Lester Lanin and Meyer Davis, wasn't particularly fazed. Despite the fact that his regular style was open, forceful and swinging in the Louis Armstrong vein, he knew how to play softly too.
He was invited back to play at the Embers with his own quartet in 1955, and the same restrictions of volume applied. Occasionally Mr. Jones was tempted to take the mute out of his horn. ''People would say, 'Jonah, just play one chorus open,' '' Mr. Jones told John S. Wilson of The New York Times in 1983. ''One night, Joe Howard, the maitre d', who had warned me to keep the mute in, was busy, and I thought he wasn't listening, so I played one chorus open. Afterward, when I came off the stand, Joe told me that if I took the mute out again I should just forget the address of the club.''
The trumpeter Jimmy Owens recalled: ''The essence of his style was to swing. His whole thing was to communicate, and that's why he stuck with the melodies. He always said of himself that he was not a chord player, like Dizzy Gillespie and Roy Eldridge and Charlie Shavers; he was more of a melody player.''
What started as a once-weekly job led to a week's engagement, which finally led to a five-year contract, in which Mr. Jones played at the club 20 weeks a year. He also began to sing during his performances of this period. The Embers became Mr. Jones's home base for the next decade, and he began to make records that further refined this sound, which verged on easy listening. His recordings of show tunes were extremely successful, and he won a Grammy in 1959 for the album ''I Dig Chicks.''.
Touring and recording through the 80's, Mr. Jones finally retired from performing in 1993. His final public performance was at the Blue Note in Greenwich Village in November, when he sang during a benefit for the Jazz Foundation of America.
He is survived by three children, Shirley Redmond of Manhattan, Lawrence Jones of the Bronx and William Jones of Cleveland; and two grandchildren.
DONALD TRUMP is known as the brash builder of Manhattan high-rises and Atlantic City casinos, not dogleg par-4's in Westchester.
But Mr. Trump is building a golf course in Briarcliff Manor that will eventually include upscale apartments and town houses.
It is called -- what else? -- Trump National Golf Club, and memberships start at $125,000.
Preliminary work began last week on the 7,200-yard, par-72 layout, designed by Jim Fazio, a prominent golf course architect. The course is scheduled for completion by the end of next year.
Mr. Trump gained approvals earlier this month for the project on the 147-acre site of the Briar Hall Golf and Country Club. It will be his first project in Westchester.
But something seems odd here.
In the film ''Caddyshack,'' Rodney Dangerfield, who plays a boorish developer freeloading at a snobby country club, declares: ''Country clubs and cemeteries are the biggest wastes of prime real estate.'' And one of the hallmarks of Mr. Trump's career is his record of eking out every last bit of profit potential -- from craps tables to co-ops -- from his properties.
But the residential component of Mr. Trump's Briarcliff plan includes only 87 units -- two apartment buildings and 16 town houses -- far fewer than a previous developer proposed. Pressed for an explanation, Mr. Trump called Westchester County ''the toughest place to build on the planet,'' citing zoning restrictions and local resistance to development.
Still, he is seeking permits to build two other golf courses in Westchester, the Seven Springs Club in Bedford and French Hill in Yorktown Heights, and another in Putnam Valley, called Indian Hills.
''The community likes having space and open air and generally prefers golf courses to the prospect of building 250 houses on a site,'' Mr. Trump said, referring to other developers' failures to win approval for subdivisions on the Briarcliff property and the Bedford site.
Mr. Trump said he would concentrate on building holes before homes for several reasons: to capitalize on the spending power of Wall Streeters catching the golf bug, his own love of the game and a need to indulge his creative side.
''I like shaping land,'' he said. ''I get a real thrill from buying it and shaping it beautifully and artistically. It's a whole other thing from building a 90-story tower across from the U.N.''
Mr. Trump said that he bought the property for $8 million in a foreclosure about five years ago and is investing around $30 million to build the course.
Keith Austin, the mayor of Briarcliff Manor, said that Mr. Trump hired ''an army of consultants'' to comply with town regulations.
''It was important for us to keep this property a golf course,'' Mr. Austin said. ''If we didn't, there was always the possibility of it being sold for single-family homes.''
Given his urban high-rise aesthetic, Mr. Trump might be expected to produce a clubhouse wrapped in shiny gold glass, but the Donald has been forced to adopt an uncharacteristic buttoned-down restraint.
For instance, the Town Planning Board required the clubhouse to be a white clapboard structure, half the size of the one Mr. Trump had in mind. Nor would the board indulge Mr. Trump's wish to hold professional golf tournaments at the course. Too much traffic, it said.
But if local restrictions have reined in the builder's glitz on the outside, the club is pure Trump indoors, the kind of place where a high-rolling golfer could take a supermodel girlfriend. Members could head from the 19th hole on a large veranda overlooking the course, to a formal dining room.
Mr. Trump hopes to have 350 playing members and another 100 social members. Initiation fees have increased along with demand, said Carolyn Kepcher, the general manager of the course. Prices started at less than $100,000. They are now $125,000 and may increase to $300,000 before the club opens, she said. More than 100 people have already paid to join, she said. Annual dues would be $9,000.
Mr. Fazio, the course architect, said Trump National will be a long course with several severe par-4's, up to 450 and 460 yards long.
''It will play very hard from the back tees,'' he said, ''and require long drives to reach the fairways on many holes.''
The course will have a hilly front nine and a flatter back nine, with streams and ponds throughout and a deep ravine meandering through six of the holes. Being built over the old Briar Hill layout, some of the new holes would use the same imprint, he said, but the holes will not run in any similar order and will occasionally even run in the reverse direction.
Mr. Fazio said the course would compare with Westchester's top courses, Winged Foot, which has been the host to several United States Open championships, and the Westchester Country Club, home of the Buick Open.
''I've played those courses,'' he said, ''and when you compare them hole for hole, it's going to be hard to decide which course is better.''
Mr. Fazio designed Mr. Trump's golf course in Palm Beach. Trump National, he said, may turn out even better because the terrain, including 7,000 trees, offers natural challenges.
''It will have no gimmicks or tricks,'' he said. ''It's built to challenge the pros, but I always give the weekend player a place to bail out.''
Mr. Fazio said his partnership with Mr. Trump results in top-level golf courses because ''he doesn't give me a budget; I get a blank check.''
But Ron Whitten, the architecture editor for Golf Digest, said that it takes more than money to build a great golf course.
''Fazio is a talented architect, and if he gets a big budget, he'll probably build a good course,'' Mr. Whitten said. ''Will it be the equivalent of Winged Foot? Hell no. Winged Foot has 75 years worth of U.S. Opens and P.G.A.'s on them.''
Mr. Trump said he plays golf once a week and is a 5 handicap at Winged Foot, his home course.
Mr. Whitten said that he sneaked into Mr. Trump's locker at Winged Foot one day and, as a joke, swiped his handicap certification sticker. It showed a handicap of 6.
''If he's a legitimate 6 at Winged Foot,'' Mr. Whitten said, ''he's probably spending too much time playing golf.''
As with many of Shostakovich's works the subtext of the Symphony No. 7, the ''Leningrad,'' has long been debated. It was composed in 1941-42, when the city was under siege by invading German forces. Is the work essentially program music, a depiction of brutal attackers and a beleaguered people? Or is there a secret anti-Stalinist protest buried in it, as some claim? Is this tumultuous 70-minute symphony to be heard as a bitter, sarcastic outcry or the musical equivalent of poster art?
Kurt Masur is clearly enthralled with the work, and his performance with the New York Philharmonic on Thursday night at Avery Fisher Hall was fascinating. He pays special attention to every passage, every stretch of the score where the music turns introspective and quizzical, making the work seem more subtle and complex. Even the extended march segment in the first movement, which, like Ravel's ''Bolero,'' builds up from quiet stirrings to bombastic outbursts, came off here as dramatic and inexorable though this is the very music that Bartok parodied in his Concerto for Orchestra.
Ultimately the symphony's flaw is its length. Almost any stretch of 5 or 10 minutes is riveting. But the work runs on and inevitably seems ponderous. The Philharmonic played it magnificently for Mr. Masur. Their performance can also be heard on a new Teldec recording.
The concert began with the premiere of a Concerto for Trumpet and Orchestra by Lowell Liebermann, a lifelong New Yorker who is 39 and very successful. With three degrees from Juilliard, Mr. Liebermann brings clear skills to his work. But here his accessible Neo-Romantic musical language seems tame and derivative.
Wanting to explore the lyrical qualities of the trumpet in the first movement, he gives the soloist a breezy melody that is spun out over the lapping arpeggios of the orchestra's accompaniment. Mr. Liebermann says that after completing this movement he realized to his surprise that the main melody was rather like that favorite ditty of trumpeters, ''The Carnival of Venice.'' That the concerto's melody is so similar in contour and mood suggests that Mr. Liebermann was not working too hard to be original.
As the music proceeds, the melody is picked up by the violins playing in gushy unison. The harmony is spiked with ''wrong note'' dissonance, but the result is very tepid. The molto adagio second movement begins with a sort of wistful chorale and church bell chimes. The last movement is a slapstick comedy, the composer says, but the galumphing humor is heavy-handed.
The problem for any composer working in such a derivative vein is the inevitable comparisons with the original models. You are tempted to say that this music was better when Barber wrote it. Or, in this case, Rachmaninoff and Prokofiev as well. Still, the concerto certainly offered Philip Smith, the principal trumpet of the Philharmonic since 1978, ample opportunity to display his brilliant technique, elegant lyricism and wide range of colors.
Thursday night was the annual occasion for plaques and speeches in honor of retiring orchestra players. The cellist Lorin Bernsohn, retiring after 42 years, and the bassoonist David Carroll, retiring after 16 years, were enthusiastically applauded, as was in absentia the clarinetist Michael Burgio, retiring after 40 years.
FORGET the lone bugler. Instead picture 650 trumpet players gathered in one place, then imagine about half of them trying out new instruments, practicing scales or rehearsing. The result -- a joyous noise, a distinctive clamor, a common language spoken by a tribe that perfectly understood one another's blasts and toots.
The sounds floated through the Purchase College campus recently, when the International Trumpet Guild met for its 25th anniversary conference. Trumpet players from Finland, Ukraine, France and Germany joined some of the best players in America for four days of networking, music making and merchandising. The recital schedule suggested how much could be done with one horn. The eclectic performers included the Carnegie Hall Jazz Band, the Lyon Conservatoire Trumpet Ensemble and the Salvation Army New York Staff Band. The trumpet section of the New York Philharmonic also played, as did Wynton Marsalis.
A steady stream of shoppers browsed through stacks of sheet music, books and CD's and fingered the assorted instruments and accessories for sale. These included a 9 1/2-inch pocket trumpet, modeled after instruments used in the French cavalry, as well as everyday items like slide grease and valve oil. A student competition took the form of a mock orchestral audition, while panels considered subjects ranging from jazz improvisation to custom-designed mouthpieces.
One discussion resembled a fireside chat, as panel members recounted the early days of brass chamber music. Robert Nagel, founder of the New York Brass Quintet, described the group's first recording session in the 1950's. ''We played in a cold garage, wearing overcoats and fingerless gloves,'' he said. The audience in the PepsiCo Theater listened raptly. There was not a toot to be heard. ROBERTA HERSHENSON
Well, one thing didn't change: the parking valets were once more dressed in tuxedos despite the heat of the day at Belmont Park. But in most other ways, the 132nd Belmont Stakes on Saturday was staged in stunning contrast to the recent past for the third leg of the Triple Crown.
Not just that the Triple Crown wasn't at stake after three straight years when it was. But chiefly because the race actually did fall apart after the two superstars of the 3-year-old class dropped out -- Fusaichi Pegasus with a small cut on his right front foot, Red Bullet because he needed rest.
So, for the first time in 30 years, they were running the Belmont without the winners of either the Kentucky Derby or the Preakness. It was as though a bunch of amateur actors were thrown onto the Broadway stage, and the marquee was at a loss for words.
Make no mistake, the cast lacked distinction. None of the 11 horses had won a Grade I stakes. Only one of them, Impeachment, had run in both the Derby and the Preakness. The eventual winner, Commendable, had lost six in a row since winning his debut 10 months earlier at Del Mar, and he ran 17th in the Kentucky Derby. He was entered almost in desperation by D. Wayne Lukas, the king of Triple Crown racing, after High Yield finished 15th in the Derby and 7th in the Preakness.
Commendable was no secret to the betting public, which wasn't betting on him to outrun his credentials: he was an 18-1 long shot. He also lost a shoe when it got stuck in the flooring of his paddock stall before the race.
''He didn't do anything,'' Lukas said about the shoe, like any trainer reporting an insignificant matter just before the most important race of the horse's career. ''He just stood there and turned, and it held in the footing and came off real clean. The blacksmith did a good job putting it back on.''
It was almost as though Pegasus, the flying horse, had clipped a wing. But losing a shoe turned out to be really insignificant for Commendable, who sprang from the gate second to the pace-setting Hugh Hefner. One mile or so later, Pat Day made his move, and Commendable threw his challenge to Hugh Hefner, who was getting tired, anyway.
As they crossed the finish line, Commendable had a length and a half on Aptitude, who also ran second in the Kentucky Derby, and Aptitude had a length on Unshaded, who had to be treated with ice and cold water on the track because of heat exhaustion.
They ran an exceedingly slow race, too: the mile and a half in 2:31, which was seven seconds slower than Secretariat's record time in 1973. Five years ago, Thunder Gulch won the Belmont in 2:32.
But you have to go back to 1970 to find a slower going than that: 2:34 by High Echelon. The longtime trainer Jimmy Jones, who should know, has often said that time isn't important in a horse race; getting there first is what counts. Maybe he had the Belmont in his sights.
On the morning after his latest coup, Lukas beamed and said: ''He's perfect. He didn't show a lot of stress from yesterday.''
Commendable also didn't show a lot of speed or promise. But then, as Lukas often says, you can beat only the other horses they put on the track. And they did not include Fusaichi Pegasus or Red Bullet.
Yet, despite all the snickering at the colts on stage, the 132nd Belmont drew a crowd of 67,810, a record for a day that did not feature a Triple Crown going on the line. Last year, the third straight year when it did go on the line (and the third straight time it missed), the race drew a record crowd of 85,818.
The record figured to be broken until Red Bullet and Fusaichi Pegasus were withdrawn in the last three weeks. But few people would hazard a guess: without the superstars, the crowd might be as low as 40,000 or as high as 70,000, depending on the weather, the Yankees-Mets game in the Bronx, or the loss of interest with the Triple Crown factor gone.
Instead, on a sultry day with the Yankees-Mets game sold out, Belmont Park hit the jackpot, the 67,810 spectators helping to set an all-sources betting handle of $54 million.
How come?
''We were coming off a three-year run when Triple Crown opportunities provided significant appeal,'' said Terry Meyocks, president of the New York Racing Association. ''That momentum, coupled with an outstanding lineup of quality racing, helped to provide a successful day for N.Y.R.A. and the industry.''
Momentum, no doubt. Quality racing, no way, at least not in the Belmont. Now, they had better keep the momentum going until the quality racing returns.
It's been 20 years since I left Long Island to live in Atlanta, and I've spent my entire working life here, so I guess that by now you may call me an Atlantan. I have gotten used to finding the city's fanciest restaurants in strip malls, and I have even done the tomahawk chop. I have grieved over my estrangement from the ocean and gone on. There is indeed only one thing that serves to remind me that this is not where I'm from nor where I intend to end up, one thing that reminds me -- in the incessant and inventive kvetching it inspires -- that I am, after all, a New Yorker: the accursed Atlanta heat.
I have never gotten used to it. I don't want to get used to it, for the same reason poor souls cast into perdition probably don't welcome the forecast, no matter how diabolically upbeat the weatherperson: it's hell; I'm not supposed to like it. I'm not equipped for it, genetically or culturally. Indeed, in a region that has seen the continual blurring of regional distinction, the heat -- or, rather, one's opinion of it -- has always served as an enduring line of demarcation between native Southerners and Yankee expatriates.
For me and my wife and everyone else we know who hails from the North, the heat of an Atlanta summer is nothing short of a pestilence. We are driven to fits of desperate nostalgia about summer days when the breeze billowed in the curtains, absolving us of the obligation to air-condition, and the lemony light pouring through the windows was soft and benign. ''We used to love summer!'' we say, with sad insistence. ''We used to go outside!''
Southerners, on the other hand, still love the summer, even though they never go outside unless they have to. Tthey have a sentimental attachment to the heat; they were formed in it, and so was their society. They feel sort of patriotic about it, the way they feel about kudzu, which takes so much of its character from the expansive temperatures that it ends up metaphorical.
Southern nostalgia celebrates not the freedom of summer but rather its creeping stasis, as manifested in Papaw's penchant for seersucker and straw hats, the fan Mamaw wielded when it got really hot, and the sweet tea that doused the sweat from Mother's delicate upper lip. Of course, as it has gotten hotter and hotter the heat has begun to obliterate, even here, the notion of summer as a storehold of memory, as it chases people from the sultry porch swing to the chilly TV room: who, after all, can get nostalgic about air-conditioning?
Now we hear from the U.S. government that the South is literally on the rise, boiling up through the temperate latitudes and becoming so pervasive that Atlanta's weather will become New York's, as Houston's will become Atlanta's. I have lived in Atlanta long enough to adopt some of its defensive boosterism, so there's part of me that wants to say it serves New York right for scoffing at our cosmopolitan pretensions. At the same time, I wonder how New Yorkers are going do in the heat, since in the South climate is concomitant with culture, and the endless miasmic summers are the crucible in which generations of genteel Southerners learned to sweat while standing still.
I wonder how New Yorkers are going to do when the heat becomes simultaneously startling and numbing, when the sun becomes this whitish disc fixed in the sky, when humidity leaches the brilliance from the moon and the stars, when long-awaited rains wind up trickling down like seepage or sweat, when the heat wakes up as early as a cranky baby and stays up as late as a drunken guest.
I'm enough of a New Yorker to want to tell you how I've done: I've become a heat-obsessive, a heat-crank. I've gone around the bend. I've written such phrases in my journal as ''the sun, it is winning,'' and two years ago I started a novel only to realize that I had written the first 20 pages about a sunstroked dog trying to get a drink of water.
My tongue hangs out from May to October, and now I'm facing the fact that those corny variations of Saul Steinberg's famous depiction of Gotham sold by Atlanta gift shops -- you know, the whole world reduced to the vantage from Peachtree Street -- were horribly prescient.
In an effort to flee the omnipresence of air conditioning, my wife and I recently set about buying a house on Long Island, though now, in light of the Congressional report predicting the heat's northward progression, the thing we worry about is the house's lack of precious A.C. There is no escape, you see. The whole world is Atlanta, unless you happen to live here, in which case the whole world is Houston.
I used to manage a law firm. They were sending work to servers who were so inept -- one literally couldn't find the Empire State Building. I said to a lawyer: ''This is a joke. Let me get my license and I'll serve those papers for you.'' In 1977, Serving by Irving was born.
Lawyers love us. They know that if a case is ever haunting them years later, they can come back to the same reliable servers that were here before. My guys have done everything -- served celebrities, had their lives threatened. One of my guys, Big Bob, once served a guy on a nude beach. The slogan I coined for the company is: ''If they're alive, we'll serve them. If they're dead, we'll tell you where they're buried.''
I don't serve papers myself anymore, but I used to have fun doing it. Another guy and I once had to serve Donald Trump's bodyguards for a divorce deposition. We ran down the street to this tuxedo place at 4 p.m., then showed up at a party at the Plaza. Ivana got us on the list. We hung out having hors d'oeuvres, caviar until Trump and his bodyguards came in. Our people have served Donald Trump many times.
We don't have voicemail and never will. You call this office and you get a human being. If a lawyer is on trial, he doesn't want to have to start pushing buttons. He wants me, he gets me. Now I have walkie-talkies, so we can get answers to the lawyers much faster. We work with a lot of huge corporate law firms and even if they have four months to serve a client, they want it done this afternoon. They don't care about cost.
You can't always do it as fast as a lawyer wants. I'll say, ''Sir, we can't just bust this guy's door down -- he's not under arrest.'' We have to hide under a tree, stake him out, whatever. And sometimes a guy just disappears. If I can't find him, nobody can.
Now I have a staff of 20, including 15 process servers. Some have been with me 15 years or more. Bob was with me from the beginning -- 23 years. Process serving is usually a transient position. But our servers make this their career. Bob now has a house, two cars, a boat, but when he met me he was living in a basement in Brooklyn.
I look for people who are creative, street-smart. People who can lie well, but are also honest. They also have to have a lot of patience. We often have to do stakeouts. You can spend hours outside a house, waiting for the lady with the pink dog to come out.
We don't want people who have done this work before. We want to train them our way. One woman who works for me is a professional singer; one guy used to be a doorman. My P.R. firm has been working on some new ads for The New York Law Journal. I'll go around with a photographer and he'll get me in all kinds of scenes. Dressed as a Hasidic Jew on the Lower East Side. In Central Park with a horse and buggy. Outside a hospital serving doctors. Lawyers love my ads.
I once tried to set up a franchise with offices in D.C., Westchester, Philly, New Jersey. It didn't work out, though. I could pay people to teach this stuff, but they're not me. No one can really do what I do.
I'm getting a private investigator license soon, so we'll be expanding to do investigation as well. It'll triple our revenues. We've worked with a lot of the same firms from the beginning. We've also seen law firms come and go. I'm still here. One lawyer said to me once, ''Irving, you still answer the phone!'' I said, ''Yeah. That's what I do.''
Most bridge players are not aware that Snoopy and his creator, Charles M. Schulz, were bridge enthusiasts. Members of the public did not understand the bridge that appeared occasionally in the strips, but they put up with this little quirk in the makeup of the beloved cartoonist, who died in February.
In May 1997 four consecutive strips featured bridge hands, and the American Contract Bridge League made Snoopy and Woodstock honorary life masters. Schulz was delighted. His strip that appeared on Nov. 7 centered on the bridge deal shown in the diagram.
The same layout appears in Ely Culbertson's ''Gold Book,'' first published in 1936, allowing a pleasant speculation. Did the bridge exploits of World War I's greatest fictional flyer find their way into the archives of the great bridge authority two decades later? Or was it the other way round?
In the first frame Snoopy, in flying gear, is sitting on a doghouse decorated with suit symbols. In the second he is engaged in a game with three small helmeted friends. The third shows the diagram, and Snoopy correctly interprets his partner's mumbled bid as a raise to three no-trump.
The reader is left to guess that a spade is led and can see that South has eight tricks. If he routinely attempts to set up a ninth trick in clubs he will almost surely fail. The defenders will establish spades and make at least five tricks in the black suits.
At this point duty calls. ''Sorry, men,'' Snoopy says. ''We'll finish that hand when I return.''
He and the doghouse take to the air, and he boldly faces a barrage of anti-aircraft fire. He is in great danger but succeeds in returning to base.
''Flying Ace Snoopy reporting, mon capitaine,'' he says.
The capitaine, one infers, is not pleased.
''Yes, sir. Everything went bad,'' says Snoopy. ''Perhaps the captain could tell me what I did wrong.''
The chastened flyer returns to the bridge game, where the troops have been patiently waiting.
''He said I should have led a low heart to the queen.''
The state lobbying commission is looking into Donald J. Trump's ties to a group that used television, radio and newspaper ads to try to block an Indian casino in the Catskills, a project that Mr. Trump also tried to stop, according to people close to Mr. Trump.
The Temporary State Commission on Lobbying is investigating the anti-casino group, called the New York Institute for Law and Society, a fact confirmed by correspondence from the group's lawyers to the commission, and obtained from the commission under the state's Freedom of Information Law.
The Institute, based in Rome, N.Y., bought the ads in March, at a time when the State Legislature was considering various bills -- all of which failed -- dealing with whether and how the state might approve a casino in Monticello proposed by the Mohawk tribe. The lobbying commission is looking into whether those ads should have been considered a lobbying expense, intended to influence legislation. If so, the institute would have been required by law to register with the commission as a lobbyist and a lobbying client and report its expenses, which it did not.
Trump associates say the lobbying commission is also asking whether Mr. Trump paid for those ads, using the institute as a front group without reporting that spending to the commission, which could be a serious violation of the lobbying law. Mr. Trump opposes development of a Catskills casino, which could draw business away from his Atlantic City casinos.
David M. Grandeau, executive director of the lobbying commission, refused to say whether the commission was investigating a Trump link to the anti-casino ads.
Violations of the state's lobbying law can bring fines up to $25,000 per incident. The commission can also refer cases to prosecutors for criminal action, but it has done so just once in its 22-year history, and no charges were filed in that case.
People close to Mr. Trump have said that he put up much of the money used for the ads. Calls today seeking comment from the Trump organization and the Institute for Law and Society were not returned.
The lobbying commission is investigating Mr. Trump and a rival Atlantic City gambling magnate, Arthur Goldberg, president of Park Place Entertainment, to determine whether they should have registered as lobbyists because of the time they spent trying to influence the Legislature's handling of the casino bills. That investigation was first reported Monday by The New York Post and confirmed today by associates of Mr. Goldberg and Mr. Trump.
While Mr. Trump sought to prevent construction of a casino in the Catskills, Mr. Goldberg wants to build one in a deal with the Mohawks.
Under the lobbying law, anyone whose work and expenses in trying to influence legislation exceed $2,000 in a year must register with the commission as a lobbyist. Mr. Trump and Mr. Goldberg both contend that they did so little lobbying that they did not cross that threshold. In a 1997 opinion sought by Mr. Trump, the commission ruled that the $2,000 rule applies not only to professional lobbyists, but also to business owners and corporate executives who buttonhole lawmakers on issue of interest to them.
A lawyer for Mr. Trump, Edward C. Wallace of Greenberg, Traurig, noted that Mr. Trump, following the commission's advice, registered as a lobbyist in 1997 and again in 1998, and that his company, Trump Hotels and Casino Resorts Inc., had reported its rather lavish spending on several of the state's high-priced professional lobbyists. ''Obviously, this is not a guy who's averse to disclosure,'' Mr. Wallace said.
To determine whether Mr. Goldberg and Mr. Trump spent more than $2,000 worth of their time lobbying, the commission would have to determine not only how much time was involved, but how much the two men earn, information they may be reluctant to reveal.
Legislators, lobbyists and lobbying commission officials all agree that there are many corporate chiefs who make calls to legislators but do not register as lobbyists.
Some Trump associates said that the commission may be looking to make an example of Mr. Trump, hoping that because he is so well known, an action against him would be widely publicized and would spur other business leaders into filing as lobbyists.
In another victory for Donald J. Trump in a long-running legal battle, an appeals court yesterday upheld the dismissal of a lawsuit seeking to prevent him from building the world's tallest residential tower near the United Nations building.
A coalition of neighborhood and civic groups sued the Buildings Department and the Board of Standards and Appeals in October, contending that a building permit should not have been issued for the 70-story Trump World Tower on First Avenue between 47th and 48th Streets.
In yesterday's ruling, a three-judge panel of the Appellate Division of State Supreme Court in Manhattan agreed with Justice Nicholas Figueroa's Dec. 1 decision that the agencies had interpreted the complex and ambiguous zoning regulations rationally and were entitled to deference.
Seymour Flug, the former chairman of the Diners Club and one of several prominent opponents of the building, said the group would seek a reversal from the Court of Appeals. He and other residents say the 861-foot tower does not fit into the neighborhood. Terry Pristin (NYT)
Mary MacLeod Trump, a philanthropist who supported charities near her home in Jamaica, Queens, and elsewhere, died on Monday at 88 at Long Island Jewish Medical Center, her family said.
Mrs. Trump was born Mary MacLeod on the Isle of Lewis in Scotland on May 10, 1912. On a visit to New York City in the 1930's, she met Fred C. Trump. They married in 1936 and settled in Jamaica Estates, and Mr. Trump went on to become one of the city's biggest developers.
Mrs. Trump was the mainstay of the Women's Auxiliary of Jamaica Hospital and of the Jamaica Day Nursery. The Trumps were also active in the Salvation Army, the Boy Scouts of America and the Lighthouse for the Blind, among others. A pavilion at Jamaica Hospital Medical Center bears their name. They also gave buildings to the National Kidney Foundation of New York/ New Jersey and to Community Mainstreaming Associates of Great Neck, N.Y., which provides homes for the disabled.
Mr. Trump died last year. Mrs. Trump is survived by four children: Donald, the developer and casino operator; Robert, the president of his father's property management company; Maryanne, a federal judge on the Third Circuit Court of Appeals; Elizabeth, an executive with Chase Manhattan Bank; eight grandchildren; and four great-grandchildren.
Trump Hotels and Casino Resorts said this week that it was cooperating fully with the Securities and Exchange Commission's inquiry into a Trump statement about a $17 million gain last year.
''We're working with the S.E.C. to have it resolved,'' said John Burke, corporate treasurer of the company, which is based in Atlantic City.
The reaction from Trump Hotels, headed by the real estate investor Donald J. Trump, came after the company said in a quarterly earnings report that the S.E.C. was considering taking action against the company for reportedly issuing a ''false and misleading'' statement about the gain in the third quarter of last year. The S.E.C. would not comment but said no action had been taken against the company.
The company said the S.E.C.'s Northeast regional office might recommend a civil injunction against the company, its former chief executive and its chief financial officer.
The S.E.C. may accuse them of issuing on Oct. 25, 1999, a ''press release that was materially false and misleading because it failed to disclose that $17 million of T.H.C.R.'s operating income in the third quarter of 1999 came from a one-time gain,'' the company said in the filing.
The gain was a result of the acquisition of the All Star Cafe restaurant from Planet Hollywood International by a Trump Hotels unit on Sept. 15, 1999.
The company said the gain was later clarified in a quarterly report filed with the S.E.C. on Nov. 4, 1999.
Columbia University is talking with Donald J. Trump about creating a satellite campus near Lincoln Center at the developer's vast Trump Place project on the Hudson River.
The main Columbia campus at 114th Street and Broadway in Morningside Heights is starved for land, with 20,000 students crammed onto 36 acres. So the university, according to three people involved in the discussions, is considering moving its Graduate School of Business and the School of the Arts more than 50 blocks south to a 7.5-acre riverfront parcel on West End Avenue between 59th and 62nd Streets.
The zoning would also allow the university to build two residential towers for faculty members and graduate students on the parcel, which is within two blocks of the Broadway subway line, allowing easy access to the main campus uptown.
But while Columbia sees the neighborhood as a good place to expand, the West Side is already awash in projects that have prompted residents to complain about overcrowding, traffic congestion and pollution. Nearby, John Jay College and Fordham University are expanding; Steve Ross of the Related Companies is building the 2.7 million square foot Columbus Center complex, and Douglas Durst, the developer, has proposed a large office-and-studio complex.
A deal would depend not only on winning over the community but also on the price, which could be more than $200 million. The parcel sits at the south end of Trump Place, a 77-acre former railyard from 59th to 72nd Streets, where Mr. Trump and a group of Hong Kong investors are building 16 apartment houses and more than 20 acres of landscaped public parkland.
Emily Lloyd, executive vice president for administration at Columbia, was noncommittal about the site. ''Whenever there is a property available that looks like it might fit our needs, we try to look at it and assess the feasibility,'' she said. ''We don't comment on particular pieces of land, unless and until we acquire something.''
But according to people involved in the talks and in Columbia's expansion plans, John Zuccotti, a university trustee who heads the buildings and grounds committee, talked with Mr. Trump about the parcel in August and scheduled a meeting for next week. Mr. Zuccotti, who is chairman of Brookfield Financial Properties, a major New York developer, was out of the country and could not be reached for comment.
''There's no better site in New York City than this,'' Mr. Trump said yesterday. ''Beyond that I have no comment.''
Meyer Felderberg, dean of Columbia's business school, said he was aware that the site had ''been under discussion.'' Bruce W. Ferguson, dean of the arts school, said he was unaware of the talks, but not surprised. ''They're always on the lookout for real estate,'' he said. ''It is, after all, the New York discourse.''
Aside from 65 buildings on the main campus, Columbia owns the 50-story G. E. Building, at Lexington Avenue and 51st Street, and Arden House, an estate in Harriman, N.Y. It sold the land beneath Rockefeller Center in 1985 for $400 million.
Over the years, the university has bought tenements in Morningside Heights for housing, though its efforts have often run into community opposition. For the most part, it has made do: it built a rare book center atop Butler Library and a computer center under another building. More recently, it shoehorned the Morris A. Schapiro Center for Engineering and Physical Research into a space behind the business school. It also announced plans for a 12-story building at 110th Street and Broadway for faculty housing and a school for faculty and neighborhood children.
Mr. Felderberg said that space was tight at the business school, where the number of students has risen 15 percent in the last decade to 1,800 students as he added centers for international business, real estate finance and global brand management. ''We are now at the point at which our expansion in terms of size and quality is constrained by space,'' he said. ''But we would be unhappy and uncomfortable about leaving the campus.'' He said he would favor moving nonessential offices off campus, as well as housing. Faculty housing is necessary, he said, to attract top professors.
The arts school, whose classrooms, offices and studios are now spread among nine campus buildings, is about to study the feasibility of consolidating into two: Dodge Hall, on campus, and Prentice Hall, a Columbia-owned building on 125th Street. The school has about 700 graduate students and offers classes to thousands of undergraduates.
Two years ago, Columbia also expressed interest in building dormitories, classrooms and studios on Governors Island. The project would have included a conference center for the business school's executive education program, a money-maker for the university.
But one person involved in the university's expansion plans said that Columbia could no longer afford to address its space problems piecemeal. ''They've got to find some big strategy,'' the executive said. ''Incremental expansion won't do it.''
The option of buying the Trump parcel emerged only recently. So far, the developer has put up two buildings at Trump Place: a 40-story building with 516 rental apartments and a 46-story tower with 377 condominiums. A third building is nearing completion, and a fourth, a luxury condominium between 70th and 71st Streets, is expected to get under way this fall.
But for some time, Mr. Trump and his Hong Kong partners have shown a willingness to sell part of the vast tract. In 1998, the Hong Kong group hired Salomon Smith Barney to sell two residential sites, much to Mr. Trump's chagrin. A deal ultimately foundered.
More recently, Mr. Trump and his partners have sought to sell the south end, a commercial parcel known as the studio site. The developer talked to CBS about building a digital-television studio on the land, but nothing came of it. Two weeks ago, Mr. Trump suggested he might build a casino at Trump Place.
A deal with Columbia could include two residential sites. At different times, Mr. Trump has said he would sell the sites for anywhere from $90 million to $400 million.
Columbia University's academic and financial fortunes have been on the rise. Its endowment has swelled to $4.25 billion, from about $1.7 billion in the early 1990's. It has consistently ranked among the top 10 educational institutions in fund-raising, taking in $292 million last year.
But any proposal for the site would have to go through the city's lengthy land review process. ''One week it's a casino, the next week it's a university campus,'' Assemblyman Scott M. Stringer said. ''Columbia should be prepared for a serious community review process. In light of what we're facing in this neighborhood any new large-scale development has to be examined for traffic and congestion. They're going to have to convince this community that it's environmentally sound.''
Donald J. Trump and his associates have agreed to pay $250,000 in fines and to issue a public apology because they failed to disclose to the state lobbying commission that he had secretly financed newspaper advertisements opposing casino gambling in the Catskills.
The settlement is expected to be ratified at the Nov. 13 meeting of the New York Temporary State Commission on Lobbying, unless investigators unearth new information about Mr. Trump's lobbying activities in New York. It would be the largest civil penalty ever imposed by the commission.
Although there would be no admission of wrongdoing on Mr. Trump's part, he has agreed to spend $50,000 on advertising acknowledging that he had paid for seven ads that appeared last spring under the name of the Institute for Law and Society, an anti-gambling group in Rome, N.Y.
According to several people who have seen the terms of the tentative settlement, Trump Hotels and Casino Resorts would pay $50,000; Mr. Trump's lobbyist, Roger Stone, would pay $100,000; and the institute would pay $100,000.
The settlement was reported yesterday by The Times Union of Albany.
''It's been settled,'' Mr. Trump said. ''We're happy it all worked out nicely.''
Mr. Trump has long feared that competition in the Catskills would undermine the gambling industry in Atlantic City, where he owns three casinos. In the first six months of this year, Mr. Trump reported spending $303,856 to lobby state legislators against gambling and a proposed Indian casino in Monticello, 90 miles northwest of New York City.
But the commission contended that Mr. Trump also should have indicated in his lobbying reports that he had spent another $150,000 on the newspaper ads. Mr. Trump gave the money to Mr. Stone, who created and placed the ads, which criticized Gov. George E. Pataki and highlighted the criminal history of some members of the St. Regis Mohawk tribe.
Mr. Trump vowed yesterday to continue to campaign against gambling in the Catskills and other areas of New York. ''It will destroy the progress that's been made in New York City,'' he said. ''It will drain money out of the city. Instead of buying cars and apartments, they'll be spending money at the casinos.''
Mr. Trump said he also continues to provide financial support for a lawsuit challenging Governor Pataki's authority to approve Indian casinos without a vote by the State Legislature. In August, the Appellate Division of the State Supreme Court reinstated the suit.
Indian tribes own two casinos in New York. Last April, the United States Interior Department approved a plan by the Mohawks and Catskill Development to build a third casino in Monticello. But that project came to a standstill after the Mohawks abruptly abandoned their longtime partner and signed a new deal with Park Place Entertainment, the largest casino company in the world.
Mr. Trump's dispute with the lobbying commission centered not on his opposition to the casinos, but on his failure to disclose all his lobbying activities. Mr. Trump's lawyers contended that the ads constituted free speech rather than lobbying, and did not require disclosure.
Yesterday, Mr. Trump's lawyers said it was cheaper to settle than to litigate, although they still disagreed with the commission.
''We have agreed to make full disclosure and amend our filings in accordance with the commission's view of what constitutes lobbying,'' said Judd Burstein, a lawyer for Mr. Stone. ''We don't agree, but we're acquiescing.''
Q: What's the one thing you've bought that has given you the most pleasure?
 It is probably the yacht. I adore the boat for one reason. If you own a house -- and I own a lot of homes -- you just sit and you go left and right and you go take your car and drive somewhere. But on the boat you are in St. Tropez, an hour later you are in Monte Carlo. So it gives you tremendous freedom.
 What else do you spend a lot of money on?
I go on big shopping sprees. But my big shopping sprees are not buying the clothes. I mean, I do buy the clothes because I'm in the public eye. But I don't buy the diamonds. They sit in a safety deposit box. I'd rather go and spend my money buying beautiful homes and improving them.
 Do you keep track of everything you spend?
 Absolutely.
 Do you have Quicken or what?
 I have all my bills, all my receipts, all the checks I sign, every single one of them I write. I have a consultation every single month. Every quarter of the year I have a meeting with my head accountant.
 What do you use when go shopping -- credit cards, checks, cash?
 I do not go shopping. I hate shopping. What I do is like this 
 week, fashion week. I go to like four or five designers. I'm looking at the show. I have the list in front of me. I am actually shopping as I'm there. And then I call designers and I order.
 What do you do when you want a pair of jeans?
 I have my licensing for a pair of jeans, so I do not buy a pair of jeans. Shoes you have to try on. So I go to Christian Louboutin, it's one boutique, or I can go to Gucci or somebody, usually when I am in Paris. But clothes and fitting and all that -- lingerie you have to go and buy because it's a fitting question, and that one I have to do.
 So how much does a beautiful bra have to cost to make you think twice about buying it?
 I really don't look. This is the time when I go to Bloomingdale's, to the fourth floor. I go there for two hours and I buy 2,000 of the black, 2,000 of the beige, 2,000 of the white. And I ship them around between the homes and the boat and that's end of it for maybe half a year when I have to do it all over again.
 Have you ever been in a cab or someplace else and had to pay cash and then realized you hadn't gone to the bank machine?
 Bank machine, forget it. I wouldn't know how to use it. That happens to me quite often, actually. I will have a $100 bill, and the guy doesn't know what to do with it. So he drops me off, and I say, When you have an extra route around, tomorrow or something, just ring the bell and my assistant will give you the money.
 If you lost all of your money tomorrow, would there be something that you really missed? Like nice meals out?
 My favorite is probably chicken in the pot from local deli.
 Really? How much does that cost?
 Probably about $5.99. Of course, I go to Le Cirque. I had lunch there today. 
 Do you ever go bargain shopping? Would you buy socks at, say, Price Club?
 Price Club? What is Price Club? There is something called Costco. When I open a house in Palm Beach or send a boat from America to Europe, I take my housemen and housekeeper and we go to Costco. 
 I have a ball. What happens when you open the house in November for the winter -- there is a major shopping to do. At Costco you buy in big quantities -- we buy the salt and the pepper and the herbs. 
 And toilet paper.
 I don't know about that. But we go there and buy the big quantities and the kitchen is stocked, and the chef goes with us. I actually enjoy it a lot. It's fun.
 Why is it fun?
 I don't know. You go, Wow, $3.99 for a bottle of virgin olive oil. I honestly don't know how much it costs normally. But somehow they make you feel good about it. Home Depot is another beauty. 
 I love the Home Depot. I go with my people, and there are the pots and there are the plants. The paper for the showers that I buy for the housekeeper. I have great fun. 
 What would you do if you won the lottery?
 I would call Ace Greenberg at Bear Stearns and let him worry about it. -- Amy Barrett
Willie Cook, a lyrical lead trumpeter with a soft tone who played in big bands led by Jay McShann, Earl Hines, Dizzy Gillespie and Duke Ellington, died on Sept. 22 in Stockholm. He was 76.
He died of heart failure at Maria Regina Hospice in Stockholm, his son Wambi said.
Mr. Cook was born in Tangipahoa, La., and grew up in East Chicago, Ind. He was an admirer of Louis Armstrong and Roy Eldridge. In the early 1940's he played with the 'Bama State Collegians, led by Claude Trenier, and he met McShann in 1943. It was with Hines's band, in which he played from 1943 to 1948, that he learned to write arrangements; he also worked with the Jimmie Lunceford Orchestra. In the next few years he also worked with Gillespie and Billie Holiday.
In October 1951 Mr. Cook joined Ellington as a lead trumpeter, a role that requires stamina and doesn't allow much room for solos. With some breaks, he remained in the band for almost a decade.
After returning to Ellington sporadically and otherwise freelancing in the 1960's, Mr. Cook gave up performing until the late 70's, and worked in a music store in Houston. He worked with B. B. King, Clark Terry and Count Basie in the late 70's; in 1982, on tour with Count Basie, he traveled to Sweden and decided to settle in Stockholm. He worked in Sweden for 11 years as a lead trumpeter with Gugge Hedrenius's Big Blues Band.
In addition to his son Wambi, of Los Angeles, Mr. Cook is survived by his wife, Krystal; his mother, Laura Cook of East Chicago; another son, Taru, of Pittsburgh; a daughter, Tawana, of Takoma Park, Md; two brothers, Hosea, of Chicago, and Edward, of Hammond, Ind.; a sister, Shirley Cousins of East Chicago; 13 grandchildren; and five great-grandchildren.
The world of tournament bridge can be considered an enormous club, in which members come and go, perhaps resuming acquaintance after a lapse of many years.
Slightly more than a quarter of a century ago, Kitty Munson was the Novice Player of the Year in Boston, and had met Steve Cooper, who held the same title in New York. Since then she has been active on the tournament scene, winning many titles, including one at world level: the 1989 Venice Cup in Perth, Australia. He gave up the game to concentrate on his career as a law professor.
Both have recently retired, and when he returned to the bridge scene this year they played together. They will be married tomorrow in East Hampton, N.Y., will live in Albuquerque, N.M., and will be active on the tournament circuit.
At the Summer Nationals in Anaheim, Calif., in August, they finished second in the Mixed Team Championship with Steve and Betty Bloom of Duanesburg, N.Y., and Mel and Janet Colchamiro of Merrick, N.Y. They had some help from the diagramed deal, which featured an unusual bid.
Munson's three-spade cue bid with the North hand is commoner for the responder, directly following an overcall. It means a strong desire to play three no-trump if partner has a stopper in the opponent's suit, and is usually based on a solid minor suit.
Cooper could not provide the required stopper, and passed East's double. When his partner retreated to four diamonds he ventured four hearts. This suggested a strong five-card suit, since he would have presumably bid four hearts a round earlier holding six.
South had now reached a game that was unbeatable after the normal lead of the spade queen, but he had a hurdle to surmount in the play. West led the spade queen and noted his partner's discouraging play of the deuce. He accordingly shifted to a low diamond, confident that his partner would ruff.
But Cooper had also seen the spade deuce, and knew what was going on. He played low from the dummy, and East ruffed. The defense took a spade trick, but that was the end. South scored a spade ruff, drew trumps, and threw his club losers on dummy's diamonds, making his game.
The game could have been defeated by an improbable opening lead in a minor suit. As it was, after the lead, no defense could succeed.
After a shift to a low club, South can play low from dummy and score a ruff in a black suit. After a weird shift to the club king, South would have to win and lead a black suit to set up a ruff.
Editors' Note Appended
Virginia Cha, a correspondent for MSNBC, positioned herself in front of the police station in Kennebunkport, Me., yesterday and flashed a photocopy of an arrest report for the cameras.
''This little card,'' she exclaimed, ''has created a firestorm for the Bush campaign!''
Firestorms and other doomsday imagery were all the rage on the air and in the tabloids, as anchors, analysts, editors and reporters scrambled to explore the nooks and crannies of one of the more combustible stories of the political year.
''A bombshell in the campaign for George W. Bush!'' a WABC-TV news reader declared in a tease for the news at noon.
''G.W.B. -- D.U.I.'' read the caption frozen under the logo of the Fox News Channel.
''Dubya Trouble'' shouted the headline on Page 1 of The Boston Herald.
It was an intoxicating narrative for a campaign season short on sizzle, and the news media ate it up.
Or did they?
For every breathless declaration, there seemed to be a corresponding expression of doubt over how juicy a drunken-driving infraction from 24 years ago really was.
''Arrested, charged and convicted. But will Americans care?'' Brenda Blackmon, an anchor on UPN's New York station, said on Thursday. Gregg Jarrett, an MSNBC anchor, edited himself after calling the story ''a developing scandal.''
''That seems too strong a word,'' Mr. Jarrett added.
Some news organizations may have been struggling over how much weight to give the disclosure that Mr. Bush had been fined for drunken driving in 1976. Major newspapers like The Miami Herald and The Washington Post played the report on Page 1 above the fold, while others, like USA Today, ran it small and inside. The New York Times referred to it in a front-page article about Mr. Bush's day of campaigning and directed readers to an article of about 850 words inside.
But there was little dispute that the campaign had a vexing public-relations problem.
For a campaign that, like its Democratic counterpart, was concerned with sticking to a finely honed message, the breaking of the drunken-driving story was an all-consuming detour at a critical juncture of a close race. Mr. Bush's aides had been so worried about possible distractions that they had declined an invitation by NBC to have Mr. Bush comment on an issue live each night this week on ''NBC Nightly News,'' a proposition Vice President Al Gore agreed to. Barbara Levin, an NBC spokeswoman, said Bush senior advisers begged off by saying ''they wanted to stay on message.''
That message, of course, was all but smothered yesterday, one of the few days in this grueling contest on which an unanticipated story dominated the political news cycles. The cable networks went to the news equivalent of Defcon 1, providing around-the-clock updates, satellite interviews and live broadcasts of routine speeches by Mr. Bush and Mr. Gore from places like Saginaw, Mich., and Ames, Iowa.
The ''Today'' program, on NBC, devoted the better part of a half-hour to the incident, during which David Gregory, who covers Mr. Bush, told of ''utter chaos'' in the campaign when the news broke. WSVN, the Fox affiliate in Miami, led its 5 p.m. newscast with the report and asked viewers to call in with replies to the question: Will the Bush arrest affect your vote? CNN even sent a reporter to interview a retired traffic officer in Los Angeles, Clint Nunez, for his take on policing drunken driving.
Though television rushed to embrace and at times pump up the drama, the nation's newspapers were more ambivalent. In Denver, The Rocky Mountain News, a tabloid, ran a headline on its front cover. But its rival, The Denver Post, ran only a wire story in its ''political briefs'' column, on Page 19. In Boston, WCVB began its 6 p.m. newscast with a piece it called ''Damage control and finger pointing on the campaign trail,'' while The Boston Globe provided a couple of column inches on Page 1 that referred to a full story on Page 25.
In Florida, both campaigns have invested vast amounts of time and energy, so the tone and volume of the coverage there was especially important. As elsewhere, the emphasis changed from city to city. On the state's gulf coast, The St. Petersburg Times played the news on Page 8, while on the Atlantic, The Sun-Sentinel of South Florida put it at the bottom of Page 1.
''A number of us were involved in the conversation last evening,'' said Paul Tash, editor of The St. Petersburg Times. ''We came to this decision and we're all very content with it.'' The piece, by the paper's political editor, took a back seat to the paper's main political story of the day, a tally of the special-interest money going to the state parties that ran on the front page.
At The Sun-Sentinel, editors had the same kind of late-night conference, and came to a different conclusion. Ellen Soeteber, the paper's managing editor, said that several editors had argued against putting the story on the cover. What bothered them, she said, was ''the timing, so close to the election; the feeling of being used, and wondering who it was'' doing the using. Ms. Soeteber said she argued, however, that the story should go out front, and that it did not seem all that damaging to Mr. Bush, because ''it doesn't make him a liar.''
From one end of the country to the other, stations played and replayed the tape of Mr. Bush's impromptu news conference in which he admitted the offense. ''I regret that it happened; I learned my lesson,'' he said, over and over and over. Many people seemed to take him at his word. In St. Louis, KDNL, the ABC affiliate, sent a crew to a local high school to ask students eligible to vote -- most of them were not old enough -- whether the revelations changed their opinion about whom to vote for? The students said no.
In Chicago, the CBS station, devoting a full five minutes to the story on its 4:30 p.m. newscast, asked local Bush and Gore supporters for reaction. Most said they thought the disclosure was of more interest to reporters than to the man on the street. And in Atlanta, callers to radio station WGST were not nearly as captivated as the commentators and correspondents on cable.
''The general consensus is that he's not a hero for this incident that happened 24 years ago, but most callers feel that he's handled it well,'' said Paul Mann, the station's assistant news director. ''I don't know that anyone says they'll change the way they'll vote.''
Editors' Note: November 5, 2000, Sunday A headline yesterday on the continuation of the front-page article about Gov. George W. Bush's presidential campaign said in some copies that he had stressed integrity ''Even as Drunken-Driving Arrest Raises Questions of Character.'' That phrasing exceeded the facts of the article, and its opinionated tone was unintended. A replacement headline went astray in the production process.
The legal battle waged by Walter Cronkite and other neighbors of Donald J. Trump's planned 72-story condominium tower on the East Side of Manhattan came to an end yesterday.
The Court of Appeals, New York's highest court, refused to hear the neighbors' appeal of a lower court ruling that said the city had a legal basis for approving what would be the tallest residential building in the world, the Trump World Tower at First Avenue and 47th Street.
''If we'd had a mayor strong enough to take a position at the outset, it never would have been built,'' said a leader of the opposition, Seymour Flug, the former chairman of Diners Club. ''After that it was an uphill battle.''
Mr. Flug and many civic and community activists had argued that the 856-foot structure should have been scaled back because it was both illegal and out of character with the neighborhood. The tower looms 310 feet above the United Nations.
The opposition to the tall tower became a cause celebre, attracting support from Mr. Cronkite, the former CBS News anchor; James Ivory, the film director; and Alberto Vilar, an investor who donated $25 million to the Metropolitan Opera. They had urged Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani to revoke Mr. Trump's building permit.
Mr. Trump countered that his wealthy opponents were upset merely because Trump World Tower would block their views.
The Giuliani administration maintained that the developer had properly bought development rights from other property owners on the block and built a public plaza in return for the right to build the tower 20 percent higher than statutes allow.
In December 1999, Justice Nicholas Figueroa of State Supreme Court in Manhattan upheld decisions by both the city's Buildings Department and the Board of Standards and Appeals to approve Mr. Trump's project.
The oversized tower did inspire Joseph B. Rose, chairman of the City Planning Commission, to begin an effort to overhaul the city's arcane zoning regulations. Under Mr. Rose's proposed regulations, the tower could have been no taller than 495 feet, about 44 floors.
Mr. Trump said yesterday that he was thrilled that the battle was over and that he did not have to lop off the top of his building. He said he expected to begin moving residents into the $400 million bronze-and-glass tower in January.
A FRIEND has a theory that our five senses get one blanket allotment of talent at birth and that the size of that allotment is pretty much the same for each of us. What separates one person from another, the thinking goes, is how we divide up what we have. The ''well-rounded'' person would actually be the well-balanced one: a finite amount of ability split equally among seeing, hearing, smelling, tasting and touching. If a little of everything seems to lead us to the ideal personality, it also, I fear, identifies someone who would bore us to death.
True talent, it would follow, is a kind of lopsidedness: a great chef with exquisite palate who decorates his house with velvet portraiture and lava lamps; an Abstract Expressionist in the studio crossing great conceptual chasms to the accompaniment of the ''Les Miz'' cast album. To squander (if that is the word) our given resources on one art leaves us proportionately bereft in others.
What I like about this theory is that it scotches the idea of talent as a thing in itself, a sort of mobile faculty that works, with a few adjustments, in different disciplines. I can make my way fairly well around music but am a fool in astrophysics and not much better in basic Aristotelian logic. In a New Yorker article a few years ago, a brilliant literary critic came to the conclusion that Michael Tippett was a more valuable British composer than Benjamin Britten; no amount of scholarship and wisdom in the world of books seems to have rescued the critic from this appalling miscalculation.
These thoughts arrived after a reading of this year's mail-order catalog from the Music Treasures Company, which crossed my desk just in time for the Christmas-shopping season. Its contents reinforce the idea that people who think and feel with their ears do not necessarily use their eyes very well at all. Music audiences at concert halls have long told me this. Handsome, well-groomed women and men do like music, but they hardly show up in droves. The average serious concertgoer gives the term ''casual dress'' new and sinister meanings.
The Music Treasures catalog, then, is the classical-music lover's source for a bright if visually challenged Christmas. As a Palestrina CD wafts delicately into the ears, why not a saxophone lamp by which to read the liner notes? (''Retired'' alto, 36 inches high, gold-lined shade, G clef finial, onyx and wood base, $350.) The prudent and more frugal customer will know that summer is not far off when festivals move outdoors and nature threatens. (Midnight black fly swatter in the shape of a guitar. Molded unbreakable plastic. A bargain at $1.50.)
Need a little history to liven up your wall? Music Treasures offers the Elvis History Map. Accompanied by full-face and profile portraits of this great American, a famous life is traced geographically from the time the singer's parents met to the date the Elvis Presley postage stamp was issued. For $2, one can ''relive his live concerts, his movie career and the world events that helped shape his life and times'' (20 by 16 inches and conveniently printed on a foam core).
Other pictorial items offer practical help: for example, the Circle of Fifths Poster. Ride the fire-engine-red circle superimposed on a seascape of ocean, blue sky and clouds as its takes on or unloads sharps and flats at every tonal port of call. The key signature of E major, even of E flat minor, will be a glance away. (Laminated for heavy use, $11.95.)
Musical pens are everywhere. They celebrate composers, instruments, clefs. The faces of Beethoven, Mozart and Schubert look up from a set of rubber erasers (package of six, $3.50), admonishing us to edit. Printed music rolls out across socks and hats, even shoelaces, though no shirts that I could notice. (What an opportunity missed for ''Ring'' around the collar.)
Humor, or what I think is humor, runs through these 112 pages; how else to explain three and a third of them devoted to the most astonishing neckties I have ever seen. (They range from the Trumpet Galore at $15.95 to the high-end Beatles Sgt. Pepper II at $29.95.) And what sly wit thought of musical toilet paper, unwinding with near-endless melody written across its 325 two-ply sheets ($2.75 a roll)? Let us end further speculation on this item and move to safer ground.
Music Treasures also implies that musical people may have trouble with the sense of taste as well as sight. An item called Notesuckers, on Page 63, tempts us with eighth-notes on a stick. They come in cherry, orange, green apple, grape, root beer and blue raspberry flavors. (The cost, $1 per package, seems high, so buy in bulk: 84 for $70.) Melody Chups on the same page bring along music you can eat, or better, food you can play. Realize a nice tune on a ''candy whistle with tone control stem'' while sucking the life out of it. Flavors are fruit punch, watermelon and raspberry. (Box of 48 for $24, which also seems high.)
And finally, don't be caught ill equipped when next year's catalog arrives. Get your Violin Telephone now, and you will have the right tool to make your orders in 2001. This device (which, according to an enthusiastic copywriter, ''even Stradivarius would marvel at'') sits up at an angle almost 13 inches high. Gouge into the sound board to extract the handset. All the necessary bells and lights are included. (No bow, but still $69.95.)
The Wallflowers jumped into the limelight in 1996 with their second album, ''Bringing Down the Horse,'' which went quadruple platinum.
''One Headlight,'' from that album, was a Top-10 hit and ''Sixth Avenue Heartache'' received extensive airplay on alternative rock radio stations. Now the band has released its third album, ''Breach,'' which has a scorching alternative edge while retaining its rock 'n' roll roots.
Jakob Dylan, vocalist, writer and lead guitarist, said he avoided adding rap or heavy metal to the songs in favor of a more traditional approach.
The group sold out Trump Marina when it first appeared there in 1997. More recently the band toured with The Who for some concert dates this past summer.
The Wallflowers will return to Trump Marina for a Dec. 7 performance at the Grand Cayman. Karen DeMasters
In the 20 years since a Syracuse zookeeper first encouraged an elephant's artistic impulses, pachyderm paintings have become fundraising fixtures at zoos. So it was probably only a matter of time before someone decided to try these highly intelligent animals out on another creative endeavor: music.
Now the debut CD of the Thai Elephant Orchestra is scheduled for release this month. The band is the brainchild of Richard Lair, an American expatriate who has worked with elephants for 23 years and written an encyclopedic United Nations study of Asia's captive elephants, and David Sulzer, a neurologist who heads Columbia University's Sulzer Laboratory and works as a composer and producer under the name Dave Soldier.
Together they organized six young pachyderm at the Thai Elephant Conservation Center, a former government logging camp near the town of Lampang, where elephants now earn their keep by giving rides, demonstrating logging skills and painting pictures for tourists.
Elephants are natural candidates for music-making. Their hearing is much keener than their sight, and they employ a vast range of vocalizations, many of which are heard on their CD, to be released by the New York-based Mulatta Records. Ancient Romans and Asian mahouts, or elephant handlers, have noted elephants' ability to distinguish melodies, and today's circus elephants follow musical cues. In 1957, a German scientist, Bernard Rensch, reported in Scientific American that his test elephant could distinguish 12 musical tones and could remember simple melodies even when played on different instruments, at different pitches, timbres and meters. She still recognized the tones a year and a half later.
There have been commercial ventures, too. In the 1850's a circus elephant named Romeo cranked a hand organ while ''Juliet'' danced, and the Adam Forepaugh and Barnum & Bailey circuses later fielded ''elephant bands.'' These ''probably sounded like a herd of angry Buicks,'' said Fred Dahlinger, research director for the Circus World Museum in Baraboo, Wis. ''They were all novelty acts, characteristic of their times.''
The Thai Elephant Orchestra attempts something different. Its members play sturdier versions of traditional Thai instruments -- slit drums, a gong hammered from a sawmill blade, a diddly-bow bass and xylophone-like renats -- and a thundersheet and harmonicas. Mr. Sulzer said he and Mr. Lair merely showed the elephants how to make the sounds, cued them to start and stop, and let them play as they wished. After five practice sessions, they started recording.
Mr. Sulzer admits he was skeptical at first. ''I thought we would just train elephants to hit something, and I would tape that and have to paste it together with other things.'' Instead, he recorded the performances intact, without overdubbing, in a teak grove, pausing only when outside noises intruded. The players improvise distinct meters and melodic lines, and vary and repeat them. The results, at once meditative and deliberate, delicate and insistently thrumming, strike some Western listeners as haunting, others as monotonous.
Mr. Sulzer wondered whether Prathida, a 7-year-old orchestra member whom he called ''the Fritz Kreisler of elephants,'' would recognize dissonance. ''I put one bad note in the middle of her xylophone. She avoided playing that note -- until one day she started playing it and wouldn't stop. Had she discovered dissonance, and discovered that she liked it? She outsmarted the researchers.''
Mr. Lair worked out a set of hand signals for the mahouts to cue the elephants while he was conducting. He discovered that some ''figured out the meaning of the signals on their own, with no teaching whatsoever.''
But is it music? Mr. Sulzer insists it is. ''I have no doubt they're improvising -- and composing, which is the same thing,'' he declared. To test out the proposition, he suggested something like the Turing test of artificial intelligence: play the CD without disclosing the performers' identity and then ask listeners the question. For Mr. Lair, it's simply a matter of interpretation, as in all art: ''Just as there are a lot things they don't understand about our music, I am sure there are things we will never understand about theirs.''
The proceeds from the CD will go to a milk bank for orphaned elephants and a school to improve mahout training -- although Mr. Lair concedes that ''profits are highly theoretical at this point.'' Nonetheless, Mr. Lair, who not only advises the Conservation Center but also trained the elephants for the Disney movie ''Dumbo Drop,'' is sensitive to any charges of exploitation. Elephants should not be ''incarcerated and made to do slave labor,'' he writes in the new CD's liner notes. With habitat vanishing and logging banned in Thailand, however, there's little alternative to tourist-camp work. At least, he says, making ''gorgeous noises of their own volition'' is light and pleasurable duty: ''What better job than to be in the prison band?''
Mr. Lair and Mr. Sulzer are devising new instruments and seeking new talent. They say one 3-year-old has already proved a prodigy, and another elephant camp is trying to develop an orchestra. Meanwhile, a second, ''easy-listening'' recording, ''code-named the 'Schlock CD,'' is on the way, Mr. Lair writes, mixed to be accessible to a wider audience.
Once nearly extinct, trumpeter swans now flock by the thousands each winter to the rural farmlands and estuaries of northwestern Washington's Skagit Valley.
In greater numbers than anywhere else in the lower 48, they fly down in November from arctic nesting grounds and stay until March, feasting on leftovers from corn, potato, wheat and barley harvests.
North America's largest waterfowl, snow white trumpeters with black bills mesmerize onlookers with their size, beauty and grace. They stand four feet tall and have a wingspan of up to seven feet.
''They're so big, and if it's a real still day, you can actually hear the wind move through their wings,'' said John Garrett, manager of the 16,000-acre Skagit Wildlife Area about 60 miles north of Seattle. ''It's like watching a 747 go through the air.''
Trumpeters often share their feeding grounds with their smaller cousin, the tundra swan, standing out like undulating swaths of snow against the deep brown of a harvested field.
A total of 4,094 swans were counted in Skagit County at the end of last winter -- 2,275 trumpeters and 1,819 tundras. That's an increase of about 800 from the previous year, according to Mike Davison, district biologist for the Department of Fish and Wildlife.
Hunting decimated trumpeter swans in the 1800's, and pushed them close to extinction. Milliners used their feathers to adorn fancy hats. Women powdered their noses with swan-skin puffs. Settlers feasted on their meat.
Stiff hunting regulations and stalwart conservation efforts -- starting before the 1920's -- saved the swans from extinction, and biologists credit their rising numbers to wildlife conservation efforts as well as cooperation from farmers and a more conscientious generation of hunters.
Swan hunting is banned in Washington State. Trumpeters are protected throughout their migration range, but hunting tundra swans is legal in several states.
The hunters' loss is the birders' gain, for those lucky enough to watch each day as dusk fades and the swans fly to sloughs and other calm waterways for a night's rest, out of the reach of predators.
Witnessing hundreds touch down against the backdrop of twilight is a sublime experience, said Darryl Thompson, president of Snohomish County's Audubon Society chapter, which leads frequent tours for the growing number of bird-watchers.
''We're trying to give people an appreciation for something besides their televisions, their computers and their jobs,'' Mr. Thompson said.
Wintering snow geese, which migrate from Russia's Wrangel Island northwest of the Bering Strait, also gather in the Skagit Valley, and in far greater numbers than their larger counterparts.
A flock of 15,000 to 17,000 at a wildlife reserve was seen on Fir Island one recent afternoon. Russ Canniff, a biologist for the state Department of Fish and Wildlife, says he expects the wintering population to reach 55,000 by the peak of the season in late January and February.
Bird enthusiasts rave about the sight and sound of snow geese lifting off by the thousands. ''It looks like a snowstorm in reverse,'' says Tim Cullinan, director of bird conservation for the National Audubon Society of Washington. ''It's deafening, too, because they all start honking, too. It just looks like an explosion of life coming off the ground.''
Snow geese, however, can be hunted. Washington's season lasts from early October to early January and can be cut short if population counts dip too low. That hasn't happened since 1981, said Don Kraege, waterfowl manager for the Department of Fish and Wildlife.
The snow geese and swans lure such large numbers of bird-watchers that crowd control has become a problem. ''It's becoming as big or more of a challenge to manage people as it is to manage the wildlife,'' Mr. Garrett said.
So the department is pushing a Watchable Wildlife program to promote ecologically friendly bird-watching and to establish more places like the Johnson DeBay Swan Reserve, a fenced-off observation area in Mount Vernon surrounded by fields and sloughs.
Members of the Greater Trenton Symphony Orchestra are mourning the death of James M. Tuozzolo, principal trumpet player. On New Year's Eve at Trenton's War Memorial Theater, Mr. Tuozzolo played a 12-bar solo of Glenn Miller's ''In the Mood,'' then dropped his trumpet and collapsed, suffering a heart attack, said John Peter Holly, director and conductor. Craig Smith, principal French horn player, called 911 on his cell phone while Donald Brodie, a doctor and cellist in the orchestra, tried resuscitating Mr. Tuozzolo, 57. ''He passed at a young age, but he went in a way that was most appropriate for him,'' said his wife, Jacquie. The orchestra's next performance, on March 18, will be in remembrance of Mr. Tuozzolo.

WHEN Jon Faddis, the trumpeter who is now the artist-in-residence at Purchase College's jazz studies program, was 12, his parents took him to a supper club in San Francisco so he could hear his musical idol, Dizzy Gillespie, perform.
After the show, Mr. Faddis said, he was introduced to the legendary trumpeter and band leader, ''but I was too shy to say anything to him.''
''So I promised myself the next time I met Dizzy I would talk to him -- and I did,'' Mr. Faddis continued. ''I was 15, and it was at the Monterey Jazz Festival. After he played we talked quite a bit. I'd also brought all of his records that I owned with me and he autographed each one.''
Next Saturday night Mr. Faddis, now 47, will have another chance to pay homage to the musician who became his mentor, in a concert titled ''Big Band Bop: The Music of Dizzy Gillespie'' at PepsiCo Theater at Purchase College.
''This concert is special to me for lots of reasons,'' Mr. Faddis said. ''We'll be playing music that I grew up listening to every day, and with Dizzy passed away [Gillespie died in 1993] I feel it's important to continue his musical legacy.''
Joining Mr. Faddis, who also plays the flugelhorn, will be several notable jazz musicians, including two saxophonists, Frank Wess and Ralph Lalama, who are equally adept on the flute; the trombonist Conrad Herwig; the bassist Todd Coolman, a fellow Purchase College educator; and the baritone saxophonist Gary Smuylan, a Hastings-on-Hudson resident.
Much of the Purchase College concert will focus on material written by Gillespie for his jazz orchestra of the late 1940's -- ''songs like 'Woody 'n You' and 'Things to Come,' which aren't heard much anymore,'' Mr. Faddis said.
''Dizzy possessed this wonderful combination of musicianship and humor, and that's what made him a great entertainer,'' Mr. Faddis said. ''When he played, people would have so much fun that they tended to overlook the musical aspects of his performance, and I can tell you -- he was very serious about music.
''The best thing about Dizzy, though, was he was always willing to help other musicians; he was always ready to talk about music. You could call him up at 2:30 in the morning and tell him you were having trouble with one part or another of a certain song and he'd spend the next 40 minutes explaining it to you.
''I first played with Dizzy when I was 15, and my dad said that I walked on air for the next six months,'' Mr. Faddis said. ''From that point on I knew that I wanted to be a musician.'' Gillespie was always ''very supportive of me,'' he said.
In 1971, just barely out of high school, Mr. Faddis, a native of Oakland, Calif., moved to New York. Gillespie was there to help and, as a result, making it in the city's competitive jazz scene ''came pretty easy to me, not that I didn't experience some tough times,'' said Mr. Faddis, who also credited two other trumpeters, Clark Terry and Lew Soloff, for watching out for him early on. ''All in all, it was a good time to be in New York City. Duke Ellington was still around, and guys I grew up admiring, like Miles Davis, Freddie Hubbard and Woody Shaw, were also playing in town a lot.''
From the start Mr. Faddis found loads of people to perform with. In the 1970's and 80's he worked regularly in the Thad Jones/Mel Lewis Orchestra while also appearing on albums led by a who's who of jazz greats, including Oscar Peterson, Milt Hinton, McCoy Tyner, Anthony Braxton and Charles Mingus.
Over the years Mr. Faddis has amassed an impressive discography of his own works: his most recent CD, a recording with the Dizzy Gillespie Alumni All Stars, was released on the Shanachie Entertainment label last year.
In 1993 Mr. Faddis became musical director of the Carnegie Hall Jazz Orchestra and has been leading the ensemble ever since.
Before his appointment at Purchase College two years ago Mr. Faddis, who lives in northern New Jersey, had taught privately and done workshops but had never had full classroom responsibilities.
Besides teaching two classes a semester, both for fairly advanced students, Mr. Faddis also organizes a pair of concerts for the college each term. In May he will present another tribute, this time to the collaborations of Miles Davis and Gil Evans. And last week Mr. Faddis performed with other Purchase faculty members at the International Association of Jazz Educators conference in New York City.
''I think the students I'm in contact with at Purchase are impressed and excited about having someone there who has played with a lot of their heroes,'' Mr. Faddis said, ''and beyond what I can do for them academically or in terms of helping them develop their musical styles, my main objective, I feel, is to inspire them and prepare them for the real world. A lot of what they need to know, especially in this music we call jazz, is not something they will learn in a classroom, though. They'll just have to go out and blow, test their chops, and see what they can do.''
His reason?
''I'm just trying to keep this great music alive,'' said Mr. Faddis, modestly.
Jon Faddis and the New York Big Band All Stars will perform ''Big Band Bop: The Music of Dizzy Gillespie'' at 8 p.m. on Jan. 27 at the PepsiCo Theater on the grounds of Purchase College, 735 Anderson Hill Road, Purchase. Tickets are $37 and $32. Tickets and information: call (914) 251-6200 or visit the Web site www.artcenter.org.
When Harry Lunn discovered for himself the work of Ansel Adams in 1970, photographs were not widely viewed as fine art, and there was almost no market for them in the United States. There was only one photography gallery in Manhattan, opened the year before by Lee Witkin. Neither Sotheby's nor Christie's offered regular sales of photographs in New York.
Mr. Lunn's discovery of Adams's ''Moonrise, Hernandez, N.M.'' (1941) did much to change that. At the time a fine-art dealer in Washington, he quickly went from avid student of photography to tireless proselytizer of photography as a fine-art collectible.
A print of ''Moonrise'' is in ''Harry Lunn: Hommage'' at the Edwynn Houk Gallery. Drawn mainly from Mr. Lunn's estate -- he died in 1998 at 65 -- the pictures in this elegant exhibition are a reminder of his superb and eclectic eye and his extraordinary prescience in zeroing in on photographers who are now recognized masters.
In the 70's few knew about an area of photography that became a passion for Mr. Lunn: the work of 19th-century French photographers like Eugène Cuvelier, Edouard Baldus, Louis de Clercq and Eugène Atget.
An albumen print, circa 1858, by Cuvelier, ''Le Sully,'' shows nature not pristine and orderly as it is in many Adams photographs, but unruly, almost shellshocked. Baldus, on the other hand, warmed to nature in an urban context, producing still, beautiful images like ''Givors, Viaduct'' (circa 1858), also on view here.
With numerous fellow photographers, de Clercq traveled to Egypt to record the grandeur of ruins. ''Exposition de Sèvres'' (1855), Louis Robert's image of an elaborately carved stone urn, is especially marvelous: oxidation in the folds of the background curtains makes the image almost three-dimensional.
Mr. Lunn also had a deep interest in other 19th- and early-20th-century photographers. Roger Fenton, whose photographic subjects included the British royal family and the Crimean War, is represented here by an elegant salt print, ''Mortar Batteries in Front of Picquet House, Light Division'' (1856). Adolphe Bertsch was one of the earliest photographers to be entranced by natural elements invisible to the naked eye, and his images here of a magnified cross section of a frog intestine and of a male scabies mite are wonderfully abstract.
There is Frederick Henry Evans, the incomparable master at capturing the soaring interiors of cathedrals. His ''Retro Choir From North Aisle'' (circa 1900) is alive not just from his skill in recording the detailing on pillars and stained-glass windows but also from his catching the delicate light falling on the floor and through the archways.
By the time Mr. Lunn came upon Atget, his photographs had been exhibited in the 1930's by Julien Levy in Manhattan and in the 50's by Edward Steichen at the Museum of Modern Art and Helen Gee at her Limelight gallery. Even so, Atget wasn't the name that he would become in the 80's, prized for his gently evocative images of a seemingly long-ago Paris. A reviewer of the Limelight show quoted William Blake when he wrote that Atget's pictures allowed one to ''hold infinity in the palm of your hand.'' That is exactly what the image here, ''Luxembourg Gardens'' (circa 1924), does.
Mr. Lunn was singularly suited for the task of making the work of these photographers known and sought after by collectors. He knew the power of buzz. His first show of Adams pictures in early 1971 drew a rhapsodic review in The Washington Post and long lines outside his small Georgetown gallery. He knew the power of personality. He dressed well, lived well, ate well, gave great lunches and parties, was generous to a fault, suffered fools not at all and hardly ever mentioned that he had worked for the C.I.A. (although even acquaintances heard about it soon enough).
And he knew the power of shrewd marketing. In 1972 he became the first art dealer to publish a glossy catalog that offered many photographs. He emphasized connoisseurship. In the 70's he had an unheard-of huge inventory of images by photographers like Adams, Walker Evans, Robert Frank, Berenice Abbott, Diane Arbus and Heinrich Kühn. This signaled a grand commercial vision and an uncommon faith in photography's popular appeal. Just as his gallery was one of the first to have book signings for photographers, he was the first art dealer to exhibit photographs at the Basel Art Fair in Switzerland.
Mr. Lunn helped form a number of superb photographic collections, including those of Sam Wagstaff, Manfred Heiting, Howard Gilman and Phyllis Lambert. When the photographers he championed became so well known that their work became prohibitively expensive, Mr. Lunn turned to promoting the work of young contemporary artists. Chief among them was Robert Mapplethorpe, whose ''Man in the Polyester Suit'' (1980) from his controversial ''Z Portfolio'' of mostly black male nudes, which Mr. Lunn also published, is included here.
Andres Serrano is represented here by a wickedly romantic image of a discus thrower, from 1988, and Joel-Peter Witkin by an imposing and just as wickedly surreal black-and-white work, ''History of the (White) World: Venus Preferred to Christ, Paris'' (1997).
It is safe to say that even as Mr. Lunn projected an extravagantly contradictory public persona, he kept the private man to himself. Perhaps recognizing this, the team of David McDermott and Peter McGough, who adhere to a 19th-century way of life, took a photograph of Mr. Lunn in 1990 that could be mistaken for one taken by the 19th-century romantic portraitist Julia Margaret Cameron.
In this image, ''The Essence or Peculiarity of Man Is to Comprehend a Whole, the 15th of December 1858,'' Mr. Lunn wears a voluminous toga, one hand raised to his gray beard, his head shown in profile. The man in this enigmatic, elegiac portrait, given pride of place by the gallery, is finally unknowable.
A lengthy battle for the Spanish utility company Hidroelectrica del Cantabrico may finally be over, as Germany's biggest power company trumped two rival offers Tuesday with a $2.7 billion bid
The utility giant RWE AG, based in Essen, made the offer of €26 ($24.40) a share for the company, topping a bid of €25.80 a share from its German rival Energie Baden-Wuerttemberg AG and Ferroatlantica of Spain, shortly before the expiration of a 15-day deadline for counteroffers imposed by the Spanish stock market commission.
An earlier bid by Electricidade of Portugal and its ally Cajastur, a Spanish savings bank, was for €24 a share.
News of the competing bids came less than 24 hours after the collapse of merger talks between Spain's two largest electricity companies, Endesa and Iberdrola. Both boards blamed stringent competition regulations for the failure of the planned deal.
According to the German company's statement to the Spanish authorities, the acquisition "represents a unique opportunity for RWE to expand its activities in the Iberian Peninsula's energy sector."
The company would also "analyze and develop other growth opportunities" in gas and water management. Its aim is to "position Hidrocantabrico as the second company in the Spanish electricity market" and to expand into connected markets such as Latin America.
The German concern wants to use Hidrocantabrico as a platform to the rapidly expanding Spanish market.
Analysts say Hidrocantabrico, the smallest Spanish utility, was the most obvious target for a bid but that Iberdrola is ripe for a takeover now. Iberdrola, Spain's second utility, controls roughly 40 percent of the market.
When Peter Guzy, a partner at Asfour Guzy Architects in Manhattan, designed the offices of T Management, a modeling agency at 91 Fifth Avenue owned by Donald Trump, he tried to create an open, inclusive atmosphere.
''I didn't want to see doors,'' said Annie Veltri, the agency's president. ''I wanted to have these young models feel welcome.''
While arriving messengers go to the receptionist, the models go straight to a 29-foot-long table, to see their bookers and chat about their appointments. Mr. Guzy enclosed the table in gently curved and torqued glass walls; the separate panels of half-inch-thick tempered glass are held in place by steel columns. The glass walls provide a subtle, sound-deadening barrier between the bookers and strangers.

The freshly laid road to Trump Place now runs from 67th to 70th Streets, but where it will end up is anyone's guess. Worried about traffic congestion, local officials, community groups and the Trump Organization are wrangling over the options.
The road, called Riverside Boulevard, was planned as an auxiliary route for traffic from the 17 new waterfront towers being built in the $3 billion development.
The idea was to create a seamless north-south throughway that connects Riverside Drive at 72nd Street to 12th Avenue at 59th Street, the project's southern border. To make room for the new boulevard, the blueprint also called for closing the Route 9A exit ramp at 72nd Street.
But Olive Freud, vice president of the Committee for Environmentally Sound Development, a neighborhood group, said, ''Closing the 72nd Street offramp would create terrible congestion.''
The Trump Organization, which is building the boulevard, has offered to accommodate the open ramp. But it said a lack of room would make it impossible to link Riverside Boulevard to Riverside Drive; the boulevard would end at 72nd Street.
Local officials say this plan would merely shift traffic problems elsewhere. ''Congestion and gridlock on West End Avenue will become unbearable,'' said State Senator Eric T. Schneiderman, who represents the Upper West Side.
Mr. Schneiderman appealed this month to the city's Transportation Department for a third option that would allow for both the exit ramp and the boulevard. But William Hirsch, an assistant transportation commissioner, said any changes to the original 1992 plan would require action by the City Council and other governmental bodies.
Such requirements may dismay community groups. With the construction of a new high-rise under way at 71st Street and another at 72nd Street soon to follow, they say, they are eager to seek alternatives before their options run out. DENNY LEE
DONALD TRUMP'S plan for a golf course in northern Westchester is drawing criticism as a threat to the water supply of Mount Kisco.
The golf course would be built on Seven Springs, the 213-acre estate where Katharine Graham, the former Washington Post publisher, spent her summers, on land owned by her father, Eugene Meyer.
The course is a few hundred feet from Byram Lake, the sole source of drinking water for approximately 10,000 residences and dozens of businesses in Mount Kisco, as well as homes in Bedford and New Castle.
In January, a group of Mount Kisco residents formed a group, Citizens to Preserve and Protect Byram Lake, to fight the golf course proposal.
The Seven Springs parcel covers areas of Bedford, North Castle and New Castle, and the golf course would require zoning approval from Bedford and North Castle; Byram Lake is owned by Mount Kisco.
''We're sitting here with our reservoir directly below Seven Springs,'' said William Glover, a member of the new citizens' group and the Mount Kisco Planning Board. ''Mount Kisco is the town most affected by this development, but we have no say in the outcome.''
A mailing by the group last month to about 600 residents spelled out why it believes Mr. Trump's proposal should be rejected, citing the risk of pollution by pesticides and fertilizer.
According to the letter, not only will harmful chemicals flow into the lake, but also the system offered to reduce contaminant flow is untested. ''There is no science that can take those contaminants out,'' Mr. Glover said. ''Once they are in the lake, the lake is finished.''
The letter also pointed to the risks of extensive blasting; the elimination of 5,100 trees; the destruction of wetlands, and the potential for erosion.
The letter further notes that the club will have ''a limited membership of 250, only 10 percent of whom will be area residents.''
Mr. Trump denies that the course will threaten Byram Lake and insists that, environmentally, it is better than the housing he would build if it were rejected.
''Here is the option,'' Mr. Trump said in a telephone interview. ''Either I build 100 houses or I build a beautiful, scenic golf course. It's very simple.
''I can make a lot more money with a subdivision of houses than I can with a golf course,'' he added, noting that he would not need zoning approval for the subdivision. ''They can stop me from building a golf course if they're crazy enough,'' he said. ''But a golf course will have far less impact on the environment. Clearly, it's the right thing to do.''
The citizens' group, however, would prefer housing to a golf course. It argues that a golf course would be more harmful to Mount Kisco's water supply because of the extensive use of pesticides and other chemicals, and that regulations on housing are stricter.
The Seven Springs project has been evolving since 1995, said Stephen Kass, a lawyer for the Trump Organization. While it initially involved 13 homes on land in all three towns, it now includes only one home and no development in New Castle, Mr. Kass said. ''Its fundamental aspect -- a championship golf course and the renovation of the Eugene Meyer mansion -- hasn't changed.''
The current plan includes donating 31 acres to the Eugene and Agnes Meyer Nature Preserve, bordering Seven Springs.
Addressing water quality issues, Mr. Kass said the course would have ''the most advanced environmental controls to protect Byram Lake.'' He described technologies to minimize pesticide use and remove contaminants. These include a linear adsorption system to capture and process surface runoff with carbon to remove pollutants.
Responding to charges that this system is unproven, Mr. Kass said, ''We are applying established technology in a way that has not been used in a golf course.''
Michael Gerrard, environmental counsel for the Village of Mount Kisco, saw it differently. ''It is true that all the separate parts of the system have been used,'' he said, ''but they've never been used together. Channeling storm water into a carbon treatment plant is unprecedented, and we don't know whether it will work.''
The system will require a state permit, and Mr. Gerrard said the permitting process could take ''several months or even years,'' placing ''significant roadblocks'' in the way of golf course construction.
Which is just fine with Pat Swindell.
Ms. Swindell, a lifelong resident of Mount Kisco and a member of the citizens' group, said: ''Why should our water supply be endangered by a golf course that just a few people will use? It's important that the little people have their say. Well, we're the little people. This is our town, and we want to keep it wonderful.''
Thrilling finishes and organizational confusion marked the Vanderbilt Knockout Team Championship at the American Contract Bridge League's Spring Nationals here Thursday.
Two of the four quarterfinal matches were seriously delayed and did not end until 4 a.m. The directors, who had failed to take necessary precautions, had misplaced two sets of boards, with the result that 16 deals in the third segment had to be replayed. Sixteen players had worked hard for nearly three hours to no purpose whatever.
Both affected matches went down to the wire. The team led by 85-year-old George Rosenkranz of Mexico City trailed by 30 at the midpoint and snatched a 2-imp victory. The losing team, led by George Jacobs of Hinsdale, Ill., included four Italians who won the world team title in Maastricht, the Netherlands, six months ago. Another group of world champions headed by Nick Nickell of Manhattan barely survived. They won by 9.5 imps when a stretch drive by Rose Meltzer of Los Gatos, Calif., and her team fell short.
The only other woman still in the event had no trouble. Rita Shugart of Pebble Beach, Calif., with a foursome including an Englishman and a Norwegian, won by 61 against Steve Robinson of Arlington, Va., and his team. In the fourth match, Andrew Gromov of Russia, with a Russian-Polish lineup, trailed by 56 after the first quarter but recovered to win by 18 against Bill Eisenberg of Boca Raton, Fla., and his team. In semifinal play today, Nickell plays Gromov and Rosenkranz faces Shugart.
The diagramed deal featured the most unusual contract of the championship. The Polish star Cezary Balicki, sitting South for the Gromov team, opened two no-trump, which in his style was pre-emptive with length in both minor suits. His partner, Adam Zmudzinski, redoubled West's penalty double, hoping to be able to double a retreat by the opposition.
But Eisenberg, West, stood his ground and had a difficult lead decision. He chose the heart six, which attacked the declarer's communications and gave the defense its best chance. South took two heart winners in dummy and had to make a crucial discard from his hand. He would have survived if he had thrown a diamond, but misguessed by parting with a club.
When spades were led, West was able to hold up for one round and play clubs. By persevering with that suit whenever he gained the lead, he established a winner and took six tricks: three clubs, two diamonds and one spade. The penalty was 200, and the Eisenberg team gained 4 imps. In the replay, North-South played in the more likely contract of three hearts and failed by a trick.
But if Balicki had discarded a diamond at the second trick he would have prevailed with best play. He would lead a spade to the ten and West would hold up his ace. West would win the second spade and lead a small club. When South perseveres with clubs, that West has the five to beat the four becomes significant. But the exchanges in the minor suits work to South's advantage, and he makes eight tricks.
So Balicki could have recorded 690, a rare score when not vulnerable, and gained 12 imps.
Herbie Jones, a jazz trumpeter, composer, arranger and educator who worked closely with two of the most influential jazz composers and arrangers, Duke Ellington and Billy Strayhorn, died on March 19 in the Bronx. He was 74.
The cause was complications of diabetes, said Patricia Willard, a jazz historian who interviewed Mr. Jones for the Smithsonian Institution's Duke Ellington Oral History Collection.
''Herbie Jones was one of the few musicians allowed to sit between Ellington and Strayhorn as they wrote musical sketches, which Jones later developed and copied into individual parts for the other musicians,'' Ms. Willard said.
In his 1973 memoir, ''Music Is My Mistress,'' Ellington called Mr. Jones ''a great asset'' to his orchestra in the 1960's.
Mr. Jones was a self-effacing musician who contributed to Ellington's ensemble sound. He often played first trumpet (the melody line) but rarely soloed. Ellington repeatedly offered to write solo material for him, but he told Ms. Willard that he had declined the offers because he did not want to be indelibly identified with the Ellington style.
Mr. Jones, who was born in Miami, began arranging and playing professionally at 14.
He attended Florida A&M College, but dropped out in 1950 shortly before graduation to join the Lucky Millinder band in New York.
He studied arranging and composition with Eddie Barefield and others and played with bands led by Andy Kirk, Buddy Johnson and Cab Calloway.
Mr. Jones toured five continents with the Ellington band. Among his recorded arrangements for the band are ''El Busto,'' ''Cootie's Caravan,'' ''The Prowling Cat'' and ''The Opener,'' and he contributed to Ellington's first and second Sacred Concerts.
After leaving the Ellington band, Mr. Jones became the first director of Arts and Culture Inc., a New York City alternative school, and as a volunteer directed the Bugle Corps of the Police Athletic League in Harlem.
His marriage to Gladys Hield ended in divorce. Mr. Jones is survived by two daughters, Jennifer, of Mount Vernon, N.Y., and Priscilla Carr of Lancaster, Calif.; a son, Herbert Jr., of Jersey City; a brother, Benjamin, of Miami; and three granddaughters.
 Polls show that there is more unanimity on the need for campaign finance reform than on the need for a tax cut. 
 While Americans have become somewhat inured to the influence of money on the political system — and do not view campaign finance reform with the same sense of urgency as they do, to say, fixing the economy or improving schools — there is widespread agreement that something must be done. 
 In an ABC News/Washington Post poll, 74 percent of all Americans said they support stricter campaign finance laws. The nationwide telephone poll of 903 adults was taken March 22-25 and has a margin of sampling error of plus or minus three percentage points. 
 The most alarming finding in the poll was the percentage of people who said that money does in fact buy influence, and that it goes on all the time. Ninety-three percent of the respondents said that politicians do special favors for people and groups who contribute to their campaigns. Eighty percent said it happens often, 13 percent said it happens sometimes and six percent said it does not happen at all. Seventy-four percent said those favors tend to be unethical in nature. 
 Those are the kinds of numbers that should give politicians pause and contenders an opening. In many ways, campaign finance reform is another form of the old "us versus them" message. 
 While Ronald Reagan did not exactly embrace campaign finance reform, he knew that Americans had distaste for influence peddling and he capitalized on it by portraying the government as the enemy. It was all made simpler for him than it is now for George W. Bush because Mr. Reagan had a convenient adversary: a Congress under control of the Democrats. 
 Mr. Bush has no such luxury. Instead, he has a problem: his name is John McCain. 
 Mr. McCain, a Republican, who along with Senator Russel D. Feingold, a Democrat, is leading the effort to change campaign financing, is at least as popular, if not more so, than Mr. Bush. 
 Throughout last year's Republican presidential primary campaign, Mr. McCain, who challenged Mr. Bush for the party's nomination, was viewed as someone who would speak his mind and was not obligated to special interest groups. He was the die-hard, conservative Republican who had received an award for political courage from the Kennedys. 
 Popularity for political leaders is often measured by the ratio of positive to negative sentiment. In a CNN/USA Today/Gallup poll, Mr. Bush was viewed favorably by 63 percent of those polled roughly the same as Mr. McCain, who scored 61 percent. But Mr. Bush's negatives at 32 percent are more than twice that of Mr. McCain's 15 percent. The nationwide telephone poll was taken March 9-11, with 1,015 adults and has a margin of sampling error of plus or minus three percentage points. 
 At a time when Mr. Bush is seen as increasingly beholden to corporate interests, Mr. McCain and his populist message pose a real threat. 
 In the CNN/USA Today/Gallup Poll, respondents said they preferred Mr. McCain's campaign finance reform plan to Mr. Bush's, 43 percent to 33 percent. Among people who say they have followed the debate on this subject closely, the preference for Mr. McCain's approach is even more pronounced, 53 percent to 36 percent. 
 Americans' cynicism about the nexus of money and government runs deep. Even if new laws are created to make influence tougher to buy, Americans' expectations are guarded. The CNN/USA Today/Gallup poll asked respondents about the long term effect of new laws on the workings of the government. Twenty-two percent of those polled said government would work much better than it does now, 37 percent said a little better, 32 percent said it would be about the same as now, and three percent said things would work more poorly than they do now.

Amiable but conceptually muddled, ''The Trumpet of the Swan,'' an animated film loosely based on E. B. White's much-loved 1970 children's book, is a bland, well-meaning mishmash that never coheres into a dramatic whole. The storytelling is rushed; the dramatic sequences are perfunctory and mechanically segued. Except for Jason Alexander's father, the characters are not sharply defined. Visually the movie looks flat and has little kinetic energy. Worlds that should have been imagined with visual wit -- the Canadian woods, Boston and Billings, Mont. -- are illustrated clearly but with little flair.
At first, the story of a mute swan who learns to communicate by reading, writing and playing the trumpet seems to want to be a hip, jazz-wise allegory. The protagonist is named Louie (presumably after Louis Armstrong), and his two female siblings are Billie and Ella.
But the jazz references aren't developed, and the film's rather skimpy musical score (by Marcus Miller) is a potpourri of rock 'n' roll and light funk with a Disney-style love ballad thrown in at the end that suggests a faded copy of ''A Whole New World.''
''The Trumpet of the Swan'' is at least an unassailably right-minded fable about language and different styles of communication. Because Louie (Dee Baker) can't speak, he can make himself understood only via the written word and the trumpet. Returning home after going to school, he is crushed to discover that his newly acquired skills are lost on his illiterate family. He eventually wins the heart of his childhood sweetheart, Serena (Reese Witherspoon), a swan who is about to marry Boyd (Seth Green), a vain, preening ladies' man, with the silvery blare of his trumpet, which conveys more pure feeling than any of his rival's slippery flattery.
Parallel to the story of Louie's development of two voices, one written, the other instrumental, is the tale of his devoted father, who out of concern for his son breaks through the windows of a music store and steals the trumpet on which Louie eventually learns to play. Conscience-stricken for having committed a crime, the father eventually returns to the store to pay for the instrument with money Louie has earned as a professional musician, and faces dire consequences.
A tangential story follows Louie's rise from street musician to national star after he is spotted by Monty (Joe Mantegna), an unscrupulous street hustler who signs him to a lifetime contract. Like most other elements of the story, this one doesn't have enough time to establish its own rhythm.
''The Trumpet of the Swan'' has more airborne sequences than most animated films, but in a fundamental way the movie never takes off. STEPHEN HOLDEN
The prestigious Cavendish Pairs approached the finish line in Las Vegas yesterday with a cosmopolitan group of stars in contention for the title. At the start of the fifth and final session, the leaders were:
1. Fred Gitelman of Toronto and Brad Moss of Manhattan, 2,157.17 imps.
2. Geir Helgemo of Norway and Sam Lev of Manhattan, 1,827.17.
3. Boye Brogeland and Espen Erichsen of Norway, of 1,815.92.
4. Giorgio Duboin and Guido Ferraro of Italy, 1,765.21.
5. Jan Jansma and Louk Verhees of the Netherlands, 1,729.50.
6. Robert Levin of Riverdale, the Bronx, and Steve Weinstein of Upper Montclair, N.J., 1,627.83.
7. Michel Kwiecien and Jacek Pszczola of Poland, 1556.50.
Sherlock Holmes once drew attention to ''the curious incident of the dog in the nighttime.'' When reminded that the dog did nothing in the nighttime, he responded: ''That was the curious incident.''
This type of negative inference was neatly exploited by Zia Mahmood of Manhattan on the diagramed deal. As South, he arrived briskly in six hearts after an artificial response of three clubs to his one-heart opening. This showed invitational values with four-card support, or three-card support plus a singleton. The final bid was a reasonable shot, and the contract turned out to hinge on the trump queen.
A spade was led, and dummy's queen was covered by the ace. After ruffing, South produced the club queen. West won with the king, clearly wanting the lead, and promptly played another spade. Apparently blessed with second sight, South ruffed this in his hand, led the heart jack and finessed. When this won, he ruffed a club, cashed the king of hearts, and came to his hand with a diamond lead. After drawing the missing trump, he could claim the slam, since dummy's spade winner took care of his remaining club.
Zia had asked himself why West had shown distaste for a trump lead at any point, when that action was likely to cut down on dummy's ruffing possibilities. He could have led one originally, or allowed his partner to win the club lead and shift to a trump. Or he could have led a trump, or at least thought about the possibility, after taking his club king. There was a strong negative inference, therefore, that West held the heart queen, and the slam came home.
The East-West victims of this brilliance were the Norwegian pair of Brogeland and Erichsen, who would have been leading into the final session if the slam had failed. Only one other declarer, Bobby Wolff of Dallas, matched this result.
''Bump it with a trumpet,'' advised Miss Mazeppa, the horn-blowing stripper from the musical ''Gypsy.'' Her suggestion that a touch of brass could brighten up an act, or at least make it look new, was confirmed two years ago when a little-known dramatist named Warren Leight shot to fame with ''Side Man,'' an elegiac memory play infused with the haunted strains of its title character's trumpet music.
The form and tone of ''Side Man,'' which won the Tony Award for best play in 1999, were at least as old as ''The Glass Menagerie.'' But in his story of the fraught marriage and fatherhood of an eternally abstracted jazz artist, Mr. Leight brought a new smoky flavor to the dysfunctional domestic drama, another affecting way for an unhappy family to differ from the theatrical herd.
With his ''Glimmer, Glimmer and Shine,'' which opened last night at the Manhattan Theater Club, Mr. Leight returns to the same territory to provide jazz riffs on another classic theme, that of two long-estranged brothers who have pursued radically divergent paths. Sad to say, this time around you're always aware of the formula beneath the atmospheric clouds.
''Glimmer,'' directed by Evan Yionoulis, has an attractively smooth surface but little of the tugging emotional darkness that gave ''Side Man'' its shadows. The production's glibness pre-empts spontaneity. ''Glimmer'' is pleasant enough, with its polished performances and gently barbed repartee. But the show never fully hooks your attention. It's like watching a high-end sitcom pilot you've seen and mildly enjoyed before. The plot brings to mind ''Beyond the Horizon,'' Eugene O'Neill's early drama of brotherhood and roads not taken, crossed with ''The Sunshine Boys,'' Neil Simon's tale of feuding vaudevillians.
At this play's center are fraternal twins, Daniel (Brian Kerwin) and Martin (John Spencer), who in the early 1950's made up two-thirds of the glow-in-the-dark trumpet section known as Glimmer, Glimmer and Shine. Now it's 1990, and they haven't spoken in some 30 years.
Martin, who remained a musician, resides in squalor in New York; Daniel, who has become a globe-trotting businessman, lives in sterile luxury in Greenwich, Conn. Behind their long separation lies a secret that is destined to emerge once Delia (Seana Kofoed), Daniel's cosseted daughter, meets Jordan (Scott Cohen), a 30-ish trombone player and the son of Eddie Shine, a trumpeter who once dated Delia's mother.
A tangled web of soapy deception emerges as Delia, who didn't even know that her Uncle Martin existed, and Jordan try to piece together their parents' shared pasts. In Mr. Leight's hands, however, it untangles all too easily, and there's not much that's going to surprise you.
In like manner, ''Glimmer'' sets up its ingredients in tidy columns, like the menu of a Chinese restaurant. There is on the one hand the unsettled bohemian world of the musician; on the other, the stiff, repressive world of Greenwich. Neil Patel's streamlined set appropriately shifts in brisk, sociological shorthand (a fraying plaid couch versus a shiny leather chair, for example) between urban decrepitude and suburban affluence.
The play's comedy is rooted in this culture clash and its attendant language problems. ''Does he still have his chops?'' asks Martin, referring to his brother, when he is introduced to Delia. ''He doesn't even eat meat,'' she answers.
The possibilities for mutual incomprehension multiply when Delia and Jordan begin a love affair. ''I never understood the point of irony,'' she says to him. In turn Martin must explain to Jordan, who has just hurt Delia's feelings, that giving expensive presents is ''how you express affection in Greenwich.''
This is comic anthropology at its most basic. And no matter how dexterous the play's one-liners, they nearly always emerge from the shallow grooves of familiar situations rather than from any depths of character. The performers volley their dialogue neatly, but it's almost impossible for them to pull freshness out of embalmed archetypes.
Mr. Spencer (of ''The West Wing'') has the most to work with. Martin is the play's inevitable center, a repository of the lore and mores of a vanishing subculture, and ''Glimmer'' is most fun when he acts as a tour guide to that sensibility. Though Mr. Spencer doesn't avoid curmudgeonly cuteness when Martin becomes an invalid, he brings beautiful pace and variety to the long retrospective monologues.
Early in the play, as Martin and Jordan share a joint, the older man grumbles, ''Your generation ruined pot.'' It's a throwaway line, but it startles nonetheless. For just a moment you sense the rich, idiosyncratic perspective of a true outsider on changing times. Soon enough, however, Martin is caught up again in the comic rhythms of a show that seems less like jazz than recorded dinner music.

Last year when Allison Smith moved into the Santa Monica Building at 345 West 70th Street near Freedom Place, she knew that a Donald Trump condominium would be built perhaps 3 to 15 feet to the west. A few weeks ago, though, she found out that the new building would loom nine inches from her kitchen and dining room windows.
''It's very upsetting,'' she said. ''Trump definitely spruces up the neighborhood, but what's frustrating is that we asked and asked for information, and now we're finally getting answers, and it's only nine inches.''
Windows of five other apartments on the southwest corner will probably have to be bricked over, because of the danger that a fire could spread between the two buildings. Even Ms. Smith's windows may be in peril. Other buildings between West End Avenue and Riverside Boulevard may face similar problems.
The Santa Monica sits seven inches from its property line to the west, with windows facing the river. Windows are not allowed on walls on a property line, in case a new building goes up next door and needs to share the wall. But because the Santa Monica abutted the Pennsylvania Rail Yards when it was built in 1905, its placement did not raise an issue.
Under zoning rules, the new building cannot be built further back, nor can setbacks be built along the stretch against the Santa Monica. Charlie Reiss, senior vice president of the Trump Organization, said, ''We have endeavored to keep the new building as narrow as possible.'' Mr. Reiss said the issue was discussed when Mr. Trump bought the land to build a 16-building apartment complex, Riverside South.
''We knew we were going to have a problem, but we were thinking in feet,'' said Rick Curnen of the Santa Monica co-op board. ''Now, we've got to figure out what we do with these nine inches, and there's not a lot we can do.'' KELLY CROW
I HAVE an unlimited appetite for pain,'' Donald J. Trump said during a recent preview for real estate agents at the Residences at Trump National Golf Club in Briarcliff Manor, the first of his Westchester projects to win local zoning approval. ''That's a secret to my success. I just can't give up.''
Westchester has not been an easy place for the chairman of the Trump Organization, whose other golf course projects in the county are still on the drawing board. The developer, who has built extensively in Manhattan, has called Westchester ''the toughest place to build in the world.''
A golf course proposal five years ago for Seven Springs -- a 213-acre estate occupying sections of Bedford and New Castle -- continues to meet strong opposition from residents and elected officials, in part because of fears that local water supplies will be polluted by chemicals from the golf course. In addition, Mr. Trump is also seeking permits for two more golf courses in the area: one in the French Hill area of Yorktown and the other at Indian Hills near the Putnam County line between Yorktown and Putnam Valley.
One of Mr. Trump's first forays into Westchester County occurred in 1995 with a plan to turn David's Island, an abandoned Army post in Long Island Sound that is owned by the city of New Rochelle, into a millionaire's residential retreat. He even announced that he and his wife at the time, Marla Maples, would live there. He dropped those plans a year later, citing the possible presence of hazardous waste and the fact that Consolidated Edison owned prime waterfront acreage.
But at the preview on May 29, despite the setbacks and delays he has experienced elsewhere in the county, the 54-year-old Mr. Trump was all smiles. He said he was proud that once the $30 million golf course, $15 million clubhouse and $75 million residential component in Briarcliff Manor were finished, he would be responsible for moving a staggering three million yards of earth.
The Briarcliff project has taken four years to overcome the local opposition. In part, Mr. Trump's aggressive attitude when he first presented his plans to the village accounted for the lengthy approval process, said Keith Austin, Briarcliff Manor's mayor. Mr. Trump bought the 147-acre property, the site of the former Briar Hall Country Club, for $8 million in a foreclosure about five years ago and ran it until he closed it in 1999 to begin work on the new course.
''He came in with the attitude that this is going to be the most wonderful thing that happened to Briarcliff Manor,'' Mayor Austin said. ''But especially in northern Westchester, where communities are rather proud of their independence, that kind of attitude is never a good idea.''
The village board of trustees said that Mr. Trump would have to apply separately for permits to hold professional golf tournaments at the course, expressing qualms about potential traffic overload. There was also local opposition to the tree cutting that would be required for the project. And he needed approval to expand the size of the existing golf course and to demolish the existing clubhouse.
ALTHOUGH the property came with the zoning right to build 87 residences, Mr. Austin said, ''If someone comes in and talks about rights, it tends to rub people the wrong way.''
Mr. Trump conceded that while his name opens many doors, it initially also sets some groups -- local residents and zoning officials among them -- on edge. Over time, the community and Mr. Trump learned to work together in harmony, Mr. Austin said, and the plans moved ahead. In fact, the relationship grew so warm that Mr. Trump's crew resodded a municipal soccer field and helped the village erect a new veterans' memorial.
The Residences at Trump National Golf Club is a gated community about 40 minutes from Manhattan. It will include 16 luxury attached town houses, which it is marketing as ''golf villas,'' ranging in size from 3,100 to 3,400 square feet overlooking the eighth fairway. In addition, there are to be 71 condominium residences, which range in size from 1,800 to more than 3,000 square feet and are located in two low-rise buildings overlooking the ninth fairway. So far, four buyers have signed contracts for the homes, which cost between $900,000 and $2.4 million. The first residences are to be ready for occupancy next spring.
Angela Ciffone, a broker with Coldwell Banker in Briarcliff Manor, said the residences would appeal to ''people in high-powered positions.''
''I don't think there will be a multitude seeking to buy here, '' she said, ''but we don't want that. It's not going to be a situation with model homes and casual shoppers marching through.''
Designed by the architectural firm of William Devereaux & Associates in McLean, Va., and built by Spectrum Skanska of Valhalla, the Residences at Trump National Golf Club features exteriors of stonework and clapboard. The interiors have large foyers, high ceilings, oversized windows, oak hardwood flooring, marble bathrooms and high-end kitchens with granite counters. Each home has a state-of-the-art security system and is wired for high-speed Internet access.
The 7,200-yard, par 72 course, which will be ready next spring, will be the most expensive private membership club in the area, said Carolyn Kepcher, general manager of the club. A membership deposit is $250,000, with annual dues ranging from $9,000 for a single member to $12,000 for a family. More than 100 of the 250 available memberships have already been sold to singles, families and corporations, Ms. Kepcher said.
It will be one of the longest golf courses in the tristate area, according to Jim Fazio, its designer, and will have several challenging par-4's, up to 450 and 460 yards long.
MR. FAZIO has described the course as playing ''very hard from the back tees'' and requiring long drives to reach the fairways on many holes. He said the course would compare with Westchester's top courses: Winged Foot in Mamaroneck, which has been the host to several United States Open championships, and the Westchester Country Club in Rye, home of the Buick Open.
The full-service 42,000-square-foot clubhouse will have a pro shop, card rooms and a fitness center with full-service locker rooms, showers, sauna, steam rooms, massage rooms and exercise equipment.
There will also be an outdoor swimming pool with heated whirlpool spa and cabana and four tennis courts.
The builder of the residences, Spectrum Skanska, is the home-building and development division of Skanska, the fifth largest construction company in the world. In addition to Trump National, Spectrum Skanska's other active residential neighborhoods include Legend Yacht and Beach Club in Glen Cove, Long Island; the Legends at Purchase in Purchase; and BelleFair at Rye Brook.
Mitchell C. Hochberg, the president of Spectrum Skanska, said that while BelleFair, for example, was designed for a broad spectrum of homeowner types -- singles, young families and retirees -- the Residences at Trump National Golf Club had a distinctly different market in mind.
''These are for the quintessential empty-nesters, for New York City dwellers who want a weekend place and for international buyers who may have one or two other homes as well and want yet another resort, high-end lifestyle home,'' Mr. Hochberg said, pointing to a display of handcrafted wood kitchen cabinets, handmade French tiles and other expensive finishing materials.
''At first, we were even going to call it the Mansions at Trump National, but then we decided that sounded too pretentious. The word 'residences' works fine, because the product speaks for itself.''
Two Indiana men recruited by Donald J. Trump to lend a ''Hoosierized'' flavor to his bid for a Lake Michigan riverboat casino have lost their chance for a big payoff.
A federal appeals court threw out a $1.4 million jury award to the pair, ruling they were mere window dressing to ''gussy up'' Mr. Trump's application for a gambling license.
Mr. Trump had considered adding the two men, William Mays and Buddy Yosha, to his casino application, although he dropped the idea without signing a deal. Therefore, there was no contract with Trump Indiana, the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit ruled.
''This case is a saga about the gambling-license-snaring process and its fallout,'' the appeals court said. ''For essentially doing little more than adding their names to the Trump license application -- which would demonstrate that the Trump team was 'Hoosierized' -- they were to receive a financial windfall.''
The three-judge panel's June 18 ruling also said Mr. Trump did not have to pay money and help the pair set up a charitable foundation, as they contended he had promised to do.
Mr. Trump and his Trump Hotels and Casino Resorts Inc. received a license in 1996 and now operate the casino.
Russia's vast northwest is stirring extravagant dreams of oil companies from Moscow to Houston. But just as gigantic as the dreams are the headaches and pitfalls.
The northwest, with its colossal oil reserves, is attracting billions of dollars in investment pledges from Russian and foreign companies. The flow of money is aimed at unleashing a flood of oil that will turn the Northwest Federal District — a vast grouping of regions that stretches from Kaliningrad in the west to the Nenets autonomous region along the Arctic shores — into a major oil-producing region.
Russian oil companies are seeking out new fields because of declining production in older fields in western Siberia. The leading Russian oil company, Lukoil OAO, estimates that nearly half the reserves there have been depleted. Whatever the hardships of the new ventures, domestic and foreign oil companies expect to reap a windfall if prices remain high.
Besides an inhospitable climate in the Northwest, the companies face an onerous bureaucracy and, according to some executives, obstructionist local governments. Oil executives at several companies complain that if they are not forthcoming with bribes to government officials their operations endure a multitude of bureaucratic obstacles and endless audits from state agencies.
Even Lukoil, which plans to invest at least 130 billion rubles ($4.47 billion) in the northwest over the next 10 years, is running into obstacles. Lukoil and Conoco Inc. are hoping to develop the Timan Pechora region, which straddles the Komi Republic and the Nenets region and has known reserves of about 15 billion barrels. "Lukoil views Northwest Russia — and I say this without exaggeration — as the region with the most potential in Russia," said Vagit Alekperov, president of Lukoil.
But in the Nenets region, Lukoil has a difficult relationship with the governor, Vladimir Butov. The company says that Mr. Butov's government is obstructing its projects in the region by failing to give the necessary permits for drilling and exploration. Mr. Butov did not respond to questions sent to his office.
"Butov is slowing Lukoil and Conoco plans since he has his own idea which oil company should be there," said Lev Savulkin, senior analyst at the Leontief Center for Economic Research. Conoco has invested about $600 million in its Russia operations, including Polar Lights, a project in Northwest Russia that is already operational. The company calls that project "barely profitable."
Conoco expects to sign a production-sharing agreement by the end of the year to invest about $1.5 billion over three years to develop oil fields in Timan Pechora in a joint venture with Lukoil called Northern Territories. Conoco has a 40 percent stake, with Lukoil holding the rest.
"We're working with the government commission to resolve the differences — part is about wording of the agreement, but the main thing is how profit will be split," said John Capps, former president of Conoco Russia before being reassigned to company headquarters in Houston in May.
Western companies prefer production-sharing agreements, which split production between the government and the companies instead of paying taxes, to avoid Russia's complex and often contradictory tax regulations. The lower house of Parliament, the State Duma, approved the agreement for the Conoco project in 1999, but the government still must approve the final joint venture plan.
Attempts to exploit Timan Pechora have stumbled in the past. In the mid 1990s, a consortium of Russian and foreign companies, including Texaco Inc., Exxon Mobil Corp., BP PLC and state-owned Rosneft RAO set out to conquer the region in the mid 1990s. But the project collapsed when oil prices plunged, reaching a low of $12 a barrel in 1998.
For small oil companies, the hurdles are even higher. Bitech Petroleum Corp., a publicly traded oil company based in Canada, said in May it had temporarily halted investments in its oil fields in the Komi Republic pending resolution of a conflict with the local authorities over drilling licenses.
Since 1995, Bitech has invested $186 million in oil fields in Komi. The local government claims Bitech is not meeting output and investment obligations stated in its licenses, but the company says those terms are not economically viable.
Bitech, which pumped about 300,000 tons of oil last year, complains that since autumn officials from various government agencies audit the company regularly and says their goal is to pressure the company.
Capitalizing on voter anger over the disputed presidential election, House Democrats raised $18 million over the first six months of the year by stepping up their direct-mail solicitations and holding a string of fund-raisers.
The $18 million sets a Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee record for a year in which Congressional elections are not scheduled. During the first half of 1999, the Democratic committee raised $17 million, and in 1997, it raised $8 million.
By the end of June, after continuing to pay off its debt and spending $2 million on a special election race in Virginia, the committee had $8 million left in its coffers.
Democrats attribute their fund-raising success to outrage over the narrow presidential election and the perception that President Bush is pushing an overly conservative agenda. In the past few months, Mr. Bush has been criticized for his stance on the environment and for devising an energy policy that some view as too favorable to the oil, gas and nuclear industries.
Republicans and Senate Democrats plan to release their own fund-raising figures later this month.
''It turns out we did have a president to help us fund-raise, and that president was George Bush,'' said Jenny Backus, communications director for the House Democratic committee. ''They were angry about the election, and that translated into a rapid rise in small-dollar donations.''
But House Republican committee officials, who are expected to release their own fund-raising figures next week, said they were unimpressed.
''If they are doing so well, why release their numbers on a holiday week when no one is in town?'' asked Carl Forti, a spokesman for the National Republican Congressional Committee.
The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, under the leadership of Representative Nita M. Lowey, Democrat of New York, also set its sights on increasing small contributions through direct mail and over the Internet.
Those contributions fall outside any potential ban on soft money, unrestricted donations from corporations and unions, already approved by the Senate.
Although the committee has not yet disclosed how much of the $18 million is soft money, a Democratic official said it was likely to be about half.
Traditionally, Republicans have an advantage over Democrats in raising smaller contributions, but Democrats are beginning to reverse that trend.
Ms. Backus said the number of people who responded to their direct-mail appeal had increased by 45 percent over the same period in 1999.
Democratic leaders sought to tap into voter anger by wording their letters to express their own outrage. In a recent letter, Representative Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri, the Democratic leader, wrote donors that the election ''was taken out of the hands of voters by Republican-appointed justices of the U.S. Supreme Court.''
Just today, Ms. Lowey sent out a memorandum underscoring the committee's success this year.
But, she added, ''this new fund-raising record is also due in large part to George W. Bush and the extreme Republican agenda.''
''Because of their growing frustration with the Republicans' misplaced priorities,'' she continued, ''our supporters are more energized and mobilized than before.''
House Democrats also increased the number of fund-raising events, with more members holding larger, splashier affairs.
Representative Nancy Pelosi of California collected $800,000 at one San Francisco event. Texas Democrats have gathered close to $2 million in their home state. And one freshman, Representative Hilda L. Solis of California, raised $150,000 in Los Angeles.
THE latest protest-riddled meeting of the world's industrialized powers is over, but not before inspiring more unease about the whole idea of these high-level schmoozefests. A single demonstrator in Genoa, Italy, was killed -- in the act of hurling a fire extinguisher at a police van -- and many influential people suddenly began to fret very loudly in public.
Any death is sad, but it is important not to let this one obscure what these protests signify. I do not mean anarchy, although they may seem to imply that. Nor do they mean the beginning of the end of growing world trade and spreading international development. Hardly.
No, the protests are mainly advertisements for the strength of the capitalist democracies that provoke them. These ardent young people, who plan their trips to these conferences on the Internet, carry cell phones and arrive by jet, often without having to stop at customs because of relaxed rules in the new Europe. They are symbols for the wonders of the very system they're so worked up about.
The Group of 8 nations are so successful, in fact, that they can spare their young citizens the travails of pointless war, periodic famines or subsistence farming. Instead, capitalism offers them the balm of extended studies lasting well into adulthood, punctuated only by public tantrums over the failure of their imagined utopia to materialize. It's a system so adept at producing freedom, leisure and long life that it gives us ample opportunity to indulge the harmless luxury of ''a nihilist avant-garde,'' as John Updike's fictional novelist Henry Bech called it in noting its absence from what was then Communist Czechoslovakia.
Of course, this luxury is only harmless while the grown-ups act grown up. These protesters, however, have no coherent idea what they're after. In general, there is talk of a better shake for the world's poor, yet the demonstrators appear to be against the only thing giving the world's poorest nations any hope at all: continued global economic growth, led by import-happy Americans whose purchases help put food on the table from Bolivia to Bangladesh.
That is why, young and handsome and idealistic as these protesters so often are, it is important to crush them -- figuratively, of course -- if they won't go home and find other means of exorcising their great guilt at their own good fortune. You may not like the collection of aging white men who, thanks in part to the power of corporations, lead the world's richest nations. But for all their flaws, the economic vision they represent is infinitely more plausible and more humane than the one their critics appear unable even to articulate.
And while these demonstrators mainly demonstrate how wildly successful capitalism has been in the various G-8 countries, their ideas are a threat to the very people they seem bent on helping. The worry is that a few of the G-8 leaders, experienced at caving in to protesting train workers and the like, will lose a little of their fervor not only for international conferences, but also for internationalism generally.
Soon after the Genoa meetings ended last month, for instance, President Jacques Chirac of France said it was time to give serious thought to what was prompting so many people to turn up in the streets. ''There is an anxiety, a concern there,'' Mr. Chirac said. ''We cannot pretend that it doesn't exist.''
Le Monde went further. ''Public opinion will no longer support these reunions, the violence they trigger and the decisions they produce,'' it wrote. ''It is time to review the formula.''
But how can it be bad that some of the world's leaders meet? And what about the hundreds of millions of people around the world who benefit from the decisions that come from these sessions? For the world's downtrodden, the rise of global trade and investment is the best hope not just for a better life but also for greater human rights, political power and a more peaceful world. The other things that have been tried so far, like collectivized agriculture and huge foreign loans, are part of a litany of failures with side effects too vast to enumerate here.
All we need now are Western leaders with the guts to act on what they already know.
Tributes to Miles Davis, who died 10 years ago on Sept. 28, include documentaries, feature articles, CD re-issues and a brand new Italian recording that moves him up a notch.
The trumpeter Paolo Fresu playing Miles Davis playing Gil Evans's version of George Gershwin's opera "Porgy and Bess," performed by the "Orchestra Jazz della Sardegna," treats the Davis-Evans collaboration like a Duke Ellington-Billy Strayhorn classic. Or a band playing arrangements of Count Basie warhorses with Lester Young's solos written out.
When not depicting Davis, Fresu's style includes elements of Clifford Brown, Art Farmer and Chet Baker. His tone, time and technique are as original and sophisticated as any top trumpeter today — Tom Harrell or Roy Hargrove, for example. Here, Fresu leans as far as possible toward the Miles-ian sound and stance. The improvisations are his own, though even here he takes care not to stray far from the context. Fresu is about the best choice possible for this assignment, but why not others in the future? If "Porgy and Bess," why not "Sketches of Spain?"
Fresu plays the melodies with a not very different approach from the rendering of a Beethoven concerto. On the label Il Manifesto, to be released Sept. 24 in Italy only for the time being, the album includes long passages — "Summertime" in particular — that can be confused with alternate takes from the prototype. "Alternative" takes do not, as usual, imply inferior. They present viable alternatives. For one, the elegant Belgian jazz singer David Linx sings "Bess, You Is My Woman Now," "It Ain't Necessarily So" and "There's a Boat That's Leaving Soon for New York." Evans's arrangements have been transcribed for altered instrumentation with great respect by Gunther Schuller. Execution and balance are impeccable. Tempi and dynamics are faithful. The Sardinian musicians interpret the arrangements at least as cleanly as the studio elite on the original.
But neatness is not all. The original is famously uneven, a take or two short, they were running over budget. It was easier for the Sardinians: They were copying. There was more rehearsal time. But they are never as fiery as the original. Not as original. None of those irresistible explosions and nowhere near the same intensity or unique personality. Without the rhythm team of Paul Chambers and Philly Joe Jones, they were doomed to swing less. Anybody would be.
Offered more work than he can handle in Europe, Fresu conducts clinics, wins jazz polls and prizes. But he never rises even to the bottom of U.S. polls. Italy, not to mention Sardinia — Fresu was born and raised in this hillside farming town — might as well be Mars.
Last month, the little festival he directs here each August featured an "Italian Trumpet Summit," including himself; the flashy, overpowering Flavio Boltro; the burning 24-year-old Fabrizio Bosso, and the Swiss-Italian veteran Franco Ambrosetti, among others (Enrico Rava was ill). One reason for such a flowering in this country is Chet Baker, who lived here in the 1950s. As Fresu says: "Everybody in Italy knew Chet, not just jazz people." Baker folklore includes the story of the first time he played with Romano Mussolini, the pianist and son of the dictator. Trying to comfort him, he said: "Sure is a drag about your old man."
"Chet was my first inspiration," Fresu continues. "He was so poetic. A lot of Americans play really well now. They have wonderful techniques and they know the culture, but they lack poetry." Fresu is nothing if not poetic. He first performed the Davis-Evans "Porgy and Bess" in February 1996, in Pescara, Italy, with Schuller conducting the Orchestra Jazz Siciliana. The sponsor, Societa Italiana per lo Studio della Musica Afro-Americana, had previously presented interpretations of works by Astor Piazzolla and Anthony Braxton. Its president, Marcello Piras, said that the goal was to "emphasize the tremendous influence that irradiated from black musical culture all over the world."
Trump Hotels and Casino Resorts Inc. submitted plans to New Jersey officials to build a $1.5 billion casino in Atlantic City, The Atlantic City Press reported today.
The casino, to be built on the Boardwalk, would include 4,612 hotel rooms in a 62-story tower and more than 500,000 square feet of entertainment and retail space. It would employ about 7,000 people. Construction would begin in 2007 and be completed by December 2009, the paper said.
The last time Donald J. Trump and Henry J. Stern made a deal on Wollman Rink in Central Park, the year was 1986, the mayor was Ed Koch and the city had been trying to rebuild the closed rink for six years. Mr. Trump came in and did the job in six months, prompting Mr. Stern, the once and future parks commissioner, to declare, ''We're going to plant a Trump tree.''
Mr. Trump and Mr. Stern are at it again 15 years later, after the Trump Organization won a bid to renovate and operate Wollman Rink, in southern Central Park, and its disheveled cousin, Lasker Rink, in the north. Pending a hearing Friday, Mr. Trump is expected to hold a license to run the rinks through the 2011-12 season.
What prompted Mr. Trump to return to the Central Park rinks, which usually open this month but may open late this year, after losing the original license in 1995 after being outbid?
''Recently, because they heard the lease is up, we would get so many letters from users of the rink asking me, 'Please get involved again,' '' Mr. Trump said.
Under the new contract, the Trump Organization will make $4 million in capital improvements at the rinks and pay an annual fee of at least $1.4 million. Some work will be done on the rinks this fall, but most of it will come after the skating season, which ends no earlier than March 20. Among the plans for Wollman are a new Zamboni, ice maker and boiler. At Lasker, wrought-iron fencing will be installed, as will new lighting and sound systems. Also, 3,000 pairs of Nike hockey skates and Jackson figure skates will be split up between the rinks.
Both rinks may open late this year. Skating usually begins no later than the first Sunday in November. The rinks could open as late as Nov. 15, Mr. Trump said.
The reason for the delay is the reason for most delays these days: the trade center attacks. The hearing to make the Trump contract final had been set for Sept. 14, but it had to be pushed back more than a month. Rink preparations and repairs cannot start until the contract is final.
Mr. Trump said Wollman ''became even more important to me after Sept. 11, because it's a very important part of the psyche of the city, and I think the city could really use it.''
''The place has a romance like very few places that I've ever been,'' he said.
For the last six years, the rink has been run by the Makkos Organization. ''But then it came up again in 2001, and Trump was determined,'' Mr. Stern said. ''He bid whatever was necessary to get it back.''
The bidding was close, said Mr. Stern, and the process was competitive, as it was in 1995, when Makkos got the license. ''We felt Trump offered a better package of capital improvements,'' Mr. Stern said. ''Also, he was more likely to be able to pay the rent.'' SETH KUGEL
Lou Piniella's stare was hard when he stalked into the interview room tonight, his cheeks puffing over clenched teeth. The Seattle Mariners won 116 games and tied a regular-season mark and the Yankees are threatening to banish that accomplishment into the small print of record books.
The Yankees edged Seattle tonight, 3-2, in Game 2 of the American League Championship Series, doing the same things they did to win Game 1, the starting pitcher throwing well and handing a lead to the bullpen, Mariano Rivera blowing away the last hitters.
The series is shifting to Yankee Stadium for the next three games beginning Saturday, and the Mariners' task is extraordinary: they must win four of the next five games against a team that has won three straight World Series championships and their last five playoff games. The Yankees were on the verge of elimination a week ago, but they are rolling now, and Piniella was furious, his face crimson.
Before anyone asked a question, Piniella made a statement. ''We're going to be back here to play Game 6,'' he said with determination that Billy Martin and Thurman Munson, his old manager and teammate, probably saw many years ago. ''We are going to be back here to play Game 6. Now you can ask any questions you want.''
Piniella's words sharpened thereafter, and he stayed on message, talking through a question about some of his slumping hitters.
''They have done it all year for us, but you know what -- there's still time,'' Piniella said. ''We've got another five games to play.''
Piniella's statement was replayed within seconds in the Yankees' clubhouse, and one coach emitted a loud whistle. The utilityman Luis Sojo said, ''That's not going to happen.''
It won't if Seattle cannot generate more runs. Andy Pettitte stifled the Mariners in Game 1 and tonight it was Mike Mussina, who held Seattle to two runs in six innings despite having less than his best stuff.
Freddy Garcia started on three days' rest for Seattle and the Yankees scored all their runs against him in the second inning, Scott Brosius ripping a two-run double and Chuck Knoblauch dumping a run-scoring single just in front of center fielder Mike Cameron.
It was the worst possible start for Seattle. The last time Mussina lost when the Yankees scored him three or more runs: May 17. The last time the Yankees lost a post-season game after taking a three-run lead: Oct. 2, 1997.
But Mussina could not exploit the experienced Mariners hitters as he did the Oakland hitters last weekend, when he pitched seven scoreless innings and reversed the Yankees' postseason slide. John Olerud and Mike Cameron flied out to open the bottom of the second inning, two outs on four pitches, no problem. Then Stan Javier fouled off four pitches in a nine-pitch at-bat and worked a walk.
Dan Wilson got ahead in the count two balls and no strikes and fouled off a fastball, and another and another; Wilson fouled seven consecutive pitches, in fact, before lining a hit over second baseman Alfonso Soriano. David Bell slapped two more fouls, worked a full count and then struck out. The Mariners failed to score in the inning but they had taxed Mussina, forcing him to throw 29 pitches in the inning.
''I don't think he had his good stuff,'' catcher Jorge Posada said. ''But he didn't give up.''
There was extra stress on Mussina in the third inning, as well. Ichiro Suzuki clubbed a long drive to center field and Bernie Williams, the baseball pinballing off the inside of his glove and falling to the ground for a two-base error.
Williams once described the mind-set of the Yankees when someone made a mistake: the focus is on saving a teammate from being saddled with a costly mistake; do everything you can to pick him up.
The sure-handed Williams grimaced after his mistake. He had allowed the fastest player in baseball to get into scoring position with nobody out. Mussina bore down on McLemore, getting him to fly out to the left side. Bret Boone, his postseason failures mounting, flied to center, and after Edgar Martinez followed with another flyout, Mussina strolled off the mound. One of the players congratulating him in the dugout was Williams.
Mussina's control is usually exceptional -- a Seattle scout saw him throw to 120 batters over the last month and never saw a count of 3 balls and 0 strikes -- but he appeared to be struggling a bit with the mound, checking the landing area after following through. His fastball sometimes carried high out of the strike zone, and with one out in the fourth, he bounced a pitch off Cameron. Mussina threw a curve to Javier, who swung, and the contact of bat and ball made a smooth clicking sound, the way a well-struck golf ball sounds. Williams ran back toward the fence, looked up and slowed as he watched Javier's home run carry over the wall; Javier pumped his right fist as he neared first base.
Over the span of four batters in the second and third innings, the Mariners had fouled off 17 pitches against Mussina, most of them fastballs; from the second inning through the fifth, not one Seattle hitter swung and missed at a fastball. So Mussina -- a Stanford University graduate who watched the movie ''Analyze This'' before the game -- went to the off-speed stuff in the fourth, fifth and sixth innings, tossing more changeups and curveballs.
''He saved his best stuff for the last two innings,'' Yankees Manager Joe Torre said.
Mussina neared 100 pitches in the sixth inning, and relievers began throwing in the Yankee bullpen. With two outs and two strikes on Cameron, the last hitter Mussina figured to face, he fired a shoulder-high fastball through Cameron's vicious swing, the first swing and miss on a Mussina fastball since the first inning. With less than his best stuff, Mussina walked off the mound with the Yankees leading, 3-2.
Ramiro Mendoza came out to pitch the seventh inning, and after a runner reached second base, Torre elected to walk Suzuki intentionally and have Mendoza pitch to Mark McLemore -- a move that is strictly against conventional wisdom. You do not put the potential go-ahead run on base, the thinking goes. But McLemore grounded out weakly, ending the inning.
Mendoza got one out in the eighth and Torre called on Rivera for the last five outs, but when Rivera lingered in the bullpen to throw a few more warm-up pitches, Piniella came out of the dugout, waving his arms angrily.
''This looks like this guy makes his own rules,'' Piniella said later, furious that Rivera was not required to take the mound immediately.
But Rivera would get there soon enough, and with great effect, his fastball moving laterally at 95 miles an hour. He struck out three of the five batters he faced, machine-like, and Piniella stalked out of the dugout, collecting his thoughts.
First and foremost among them: The Mariners will play again here. They will survive Yankee Stadium, survive the Yankees.
''You can start swinging the bat and get on a roll,'' Piniella said. ''It takes only one game.''
Shares of Trump Hotels and Casino Resorts fell 20 percent yesterday after the chairman, Donald Trump, said on Tuesday that the company might not make a scheduled $90 million interest payment next month and might seek to restructure the debt.
Trump Hotels' shares fell 25 cents, to $1, a new low. It owns Trump Taj Mahal, Trump Plaza and Trump Marina casinos in Atlantic City and a riverboat casino in Indiana. The company's bonds have fallen about 10 points in the last few weeks, analysts said.
As early as April, bond analysts had warned that declining results at the company might make it hard for Trump to meet debt payments. The terrorist attacks, which curbed travel, and a plan by the state of New York to add as many as six Indian casinos will drain even more revenue from Atlantic City, Mr. Trump said.
He said that the company was generating enough cash flow to make the payments if it wished but that ''until we have a package that's satisfactory, we're going to withhold payment.''
Mr. Trump said he was in talks with bondholders about amending the terms of some or all of the company's $1.6 billion in debt. The debt comes due in 2003.
Trump Atlantic City's 11.25 percent coupon notes due in 2006 fell about 3 cents yesterday to about 58 cents on the dollar, traders said. The notes traded at 72.5 cents on Sept. 10.
Moody's Investors Service said yesterday that it had cut -- and may cut again -- its debt ratings for Trump Atlantic City Associates after the company failed to pay a scheduled interest payment on about $1.3 billion of senior secured debt.
Donald Trump, who owns 42 percent of the unit's parent company, Trump Hotels and Casino Resorts, said last week that he was considering delaying the payments while New York considered a plan to expand gambling, which could hurt his Atlantic City casinos.
Moody's cut both the senior secured and senior implied ratings of Trump Atlantic City Associates to Caa3, its third-lowest grade, from B3.
In addition, Moody's said it might lower them further. It also cut Trump Castle Funding's senior secured and senior implied ratings to Caa3 from Caa1 and said it may cut them again.
The move follows similar action on Friday from Standard & Poor's, which cut Trump Atlantic City Associates to a default grade, or D, from CC.
Trump shares closed yesterday up a penny, at 88 cents, on the New York Stock Exchange.
Donald J. Trump has begun talks with bondholders to adjust the terms of $1.3 billion in debt and is now expected to pay $73 million in interest past due on those bonds within days, a lawyer for Mr. Trump said yesterday.
Mr. Trump announced on Oct. 31, the day before the interest was due, that he would not make the payment, even though he said he had the cash to do so. If he failed to make the payment by the end of this month, the debt would be in default and bondholders would have the right to force the company that issued the debt, Trump Atlantic City, into bankruptcy. The bonds are backed by two of Mr. Trump's three Atlantic City casinos, the Trump Taj Mahal and the Trump Plaza.
The economic decline set off by the attacks on Sept. 11, along with recent legislation to allow gambling in New York State has darkened the prospects for his casinos, Mr. Trump said last month. He warned that any New York casinos built within the next few years could divert business from Atlantic City and his casinos.
Soon after Mr. Trump's announcement, bondholders hired the prominent bankruptcy lawyer Harvey Miller, a partner at Weil Gotshal & Manges, and began negotiations with Mr. Trump to restructure the debt, possibly by cutting interest payments.
Some bondholders considered the missed payment a negotiating tactic by Mr. Trump, who could use a decline in the securities to put pressure on them to come to the table.
With the advent of talks, Mr. Trump is now more willing to pay his bondholders, said his lawyer, David Friedman, a senior partner at Kasowitz, Benson, Torres & Friedman. ''Bondholders have expressed a willingness to address issues important to us,'' he said.
Mr. Trump referred calls for comment to his lawyer.
In a sign that the real estate market has not collapsed, Donald J. Trump outmaneuvered three other bidders Wednesday night to buy the Hotel Delmonico on the Upper East Side for $115 million.
The 32-story hotel, at the northwest corner of Park Avenue and 59th Street, is known more for its location in one of the most expensive residential neighborhoods in the world than for its architecture.
''It's a great location,'' said Thomas P. McConnell, a hotel specialist and a senior managing director of Insignia/ESG. ''How often can you buy something on Park Avenue? It's a trophy in that respect.''
Mr. Trump was elated. He said he expected to close the deal in 120 days.
Mr. Trump is buying the hotel from the estate of Sarah Korein, a legendary real estate investor who combined charm with a tough-as-nails approach to negotiations. Mrs. Korein died three years ago. The hotel has been run by her daughter, Elysabeth Kleinhans, for more than a decade.
''It's been interesting,'' Mrs. Kleinhans said yesterday, ''but I'll be quite happy to get out of here. My mother loved the excitement of having a hotel. My dream is to have a theater complex, not a hotel.''
Mrs. Kleinhans said she had plans for a small building she owns that houses the Kaplan Deli and is adjacent to the hotel on 59th Street. She plans to convert the building into a not-for-profit theater complex when the deli's lease expires in April.
Mr. Trump won out over bids from three other parties for the hotel: Alan B. Friedberg; Aby Rosen and Michael Fuchs; and Izak Senbahar and Simon Elias.
''I'm disappointed,'' said Mr. Friedberg, who had bid $118 million. ''I would've liked to have it. But it's O.K.''
Although Mr. Friedberg had a higher bid, the Korein family said that Mr. Trump was willing to put money at risk before he got the title, which made the Koreins confident that he would close the deal. But one person involved in the bidding said Mr. Trump was still putting together his financing package.
''All the bids were in a tight cluster,'' said Joseph Williams III, a managing director of Sonneblick Goldman Corporation, which advised the Koreins. ''We were in a position to go from one to the other if we ran into any bumps.''
Mr. McConnell said he expected Mr. Trump to transform the Delmonico into a condominium hotel not unlike the Trump International Hotel and Tower.
It would not be the first time that the Delmonico changed.
The owners of the 525-room Delmonico went bankrupt shortly after the hotel opened in 1929, amid the Depression. William Zeckendorf Jr., the developer, bought the building in 1974, converted it into a luxury apartment house and installed Christie's auction house as a retail tenant.
A decade later, Mr. Zeckendorf sold the property for $32 million to Ms. Korein, who turned it back into a hotel, converting the apartments into about 200 suites.
When Mrs. Korein died at 93, her holdings included either the land or the land and the building at Lever House, 390 Park Avenue, between 53rd and 54th; the old Equitable Building, 120 Broadway, between Cedar and Pine Streets; and 1 Penn Plaza, the fourth-largest office building in the city. Mrs. Kleinhans said her family had no plans to sell the other properties.
Saudi men applying for visas to the United States must submit photographs with their heads uncovered, the United States Embassy in Riyadh said. The new rule, requiring removal of the traditional Saudi headdress, is part of tighter procedures since the Sept. 11 attacks, diplomats said. The Bush administration has said that most of the 19 hijackers in the attacks were men who received their visas from American missions in Saudi Arabia. The embassy said women who cover their heads because of religious beliefs could continue to submit photographs with their heads covered ''on the condition that the applicant's face and features are clearly visible.''

The debt rating of Trump Hotels and Casino Resorts was raised by Standard & Poor's yesterday after Trump, a casino company, made a $91 million payment to bondholders before a grace period expired.
S.& P., the credit rating company, raised the corporate credit rating and senior secured debt rating on Trump -- which is based in Atlantic City and is led by Donald J. Trump -- two notches, to CC from D.
S.& P. cut the ratings Nov. 2 after Trump Hotels failed to make the interest payments that were due the day before. The company owns the Trump Taj Mahal, Trump Marina and Trump Plaza casinos in Atlantic City and a riverboat casino in Indiana.
Mr. Trump has said that the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks and planned development of six Indian casinos in New York would drain revenue from Atlantic City, and that he would withhold interest payments on the debt until bondholders agreed to amend the terms.
The company made the payment last week after saying that a bondholders' committee had been formed for negotiating.
Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, who has frequently encouraged New Yorkers to hop on commercial airplanes as a way of returning to normalcy, asked to borrow an airplane belonging to Donald Trump for his visit to Israel last weekend. Mr. Giuliani, who had been invited to ride along with Mayor-elect Michael R. Bloomberg and Gov. George E. Pataki on Mr. Bloomberg's private jet, chose to take Mr. Trump's plane instead.
''The reason for doing it that way was merely to be able to get back in time,'' Mr. Giuliani said yesterday, adding that it would have taken an extra 12 hours to fly commercial, something he said he had ''absolutely no trepidation about doing.'' He added that he planned to fly on commercial planes frequently once he left office in January. The mayor took two Continental Airlines flights to Arizona for the World Series in October, but those were charter flights.
Mr. Giuliani also said yesterday that the city's Conflict of Interest Board had signed off on the use of the Trump jet, and that the trip was paid for by a number of private donors. Under the City Charter, city officials are barred from accepting gifts from people who do business with the city or who give gifts specifically because the recipient holds a government post. Mr. Trump has received various tax breaks from the city.
Wayne G. Hawley, a lawyer for the board, said yesterday that he could not comment on whether a board member had consulted with the mayor's office about the trip. But he referred a reporter to a rule in the law that permitted public officials to accept trips on behalf of the city if the trip was ''no longer than reasonably necessary to accomplish'' its purpose and was for city business. Mr. Giuliani's trip was barely 24 hours long. Mr. Hawley said he could not confirm that the mayor's trip met that criteria, or whether his office had consulted with Larry Levy, one of the mayor's lawyers.
Sonny Mindel, the mayor's press secretary, said last night that Mr. Trump was reimbursed by a New York businessman, Jeff Silverman, and an Israeli businessman, Daniel Ben-Naim. The official added that the mayor opted for Mr. Trump's plane over Mr. Bloomberg's because of a scheduling conflict with a memorial for a firefighter who was killed in the Sept. 11 attack on the World Trade Center.
The night before the trip, the mayor's office asked Mr. Trump's office whether it could use his Boeing 727 for the trip, and Mr. Trump was happy to oblige, an official in his organization said. The mayor took along police officers, his friend Judith Nathan, and several others.
''I think it's a wonderful thing for Israel and a wonderful thing for New York and I was happy to be able to do it so quickly,'' Mr. Trump said. ''His visit was a great success.'' Mr. Trump said that he believed his company was reimbursed for expenses but that he did not know by whom or for how much.
Last year, the Conflict of Interest Board publicly rebuked former Police Commissioner Howard Safir for accepting a free trip to the Academy Awards from the chief executive of Revlon, and told him that it was a conflict for him to accept gifts from a company that used off-duty police officers for security.
Mr. Safir and his wife flew from New Jersey to Los Angeles in March 1999 in a private Lear jet courtesy of the Revlon executive, George Fellows, on the eve of a City Council hearing concerning the fatal police shooting of Amadou Diallo.
The Fifth Avenue Presbyterian Church is on the northwest corner of Fifth Avenue and 55th Street, just north of Rockefeller Center. It's in the heart of a neighborhood that is saturated with money.
The St. Regis Hotel is on the southeast corner. On the ground floor of the St. Regis is a Godiva chocolatier and a Louis Vuitton showroom. If you're contemplating a cruise, you should drop by Louis Vuitton. You can pick up an exquisite handmade Damier trunk for a shade over $10,000. Grab some chocolates at Godiva on the way back to your limousine.
There are princesses and pink Christmas trees to delight the shoppers in the Disney Store on the northeast corner. And on the southwest corner is the Peninsula Hotel, where you can kick back and blow $400 or $500 on room service in a suite that, since Sept. 11, can be had for the bargain rate of $1,390 a night.
It's a nice neighborhood. And everything would be swell if the Fifth Avenue Presbyterian Church could only manage to take its Christian charity mandates a little less seriously. You see, the church has been allowing homeless people to sleep on its property.
They sleep on the steps and on the ground adjacent to the church -- 20 or 30 of them spending the night in cardboard boxes and other makeshift shelters. The church makes bathrooms available to them and allows them to come in and warm up in the morning, before they take off for the day.
This may sound like just the sort of thing President Bush had in mind when he suggested that faith-based organizations fill some of society's social service needs. But the thing you have to remember about the homeless, if you want to look at this from, say, the point of view of the Giuliani administration, is that they are unsightly. You can't have a couple of dozen people in threadbare clothes sleeping right out there where rich people can see them. Some of them were snoring away just a few yards from the double-parked limousines.
So the city sicced the cops on them.
At least three times this month the police have raided the area and forced the homeless, under threat of arrest, to go elsewhere. The most obnoxious raid came on the night of Dec. 11. Margaret Shafer, director of the church's outreach program, said five police cars and three vans arrived at the church about midnight and police officers chased away most of the sleepers, leaving only those who had taken refuge on the church steps and under an archway.
''Then,'' said Ms. Shafer, ''about every hour for the rest of the night they came up to the people they had left in place and they beat on the boxes with billy clubs and woke them up and asked them how their health was. It was not the police's finest hour.''
In fairness to the individual police officers, they did not seem happy with this duty. Ms. Shafer said the church generally has very good relations with the police. And a couple of the cops I spoke with at the church this week made it clear that harassing the homeless was not their idea of appropriate police work.
''The orders came from on high,'' said one officer.
When I asked another officer to explain the crackdown, he pointed toward the Fifth Avenue street sign. ''They think it's bad for the area's image,'' he said.
The homeless have been sleeping outside the church, with the blessings of its congregation, for about two years. The police were generally tolerant. But Ms. Shafer noted that church officials had been asked to clear the area a few nights in late November and early December because dignitaries were staying in nearby hotels. She said officers on the beat told her one of the dignitaries was Vice President Dick Cheney.
Church officials complied, asking the homeless to stay away on those particular nights. When the homeless returned, the crackdown came.
Yesterday a federal judge issued a temporary ruling barring the police from taking additional action against the homeless at the church. The matter will be argued further in court.
But the ultimate issue remains. Where is the city's heart? Why, in hard times, is the Giuliani administration pursuing this particularly mean-spirited case?
Well, it's a tough time for business, too. Ten-thousand-dollar Damier trunks are not exactly hopping off the shelves. And when the crunch comes, commerce almost always trumps charity, Christian or otherwise.
Conte Candoli, a jazz trumpeter who gained national renown as a musical mainstay of the ''Tonight'' show in the Johnny Carson era, died last Friday in Palm Desert, Calif. He was 74 and lived in Bermuda Dunes, Calif.
The cause was cancer, his family said.
Born Secondo Candoli in Mishawaka, Ind., he started playing professionally at 16 with the Woody Herman Orchestra during high school summer vacations. His style evoked the bebop artistry of Dizzy Gillespie.
His career closely paralleled that of his brother Pete, another noted trumpeter. When not occupied with ''Tonight'' they often performed studio work backing up top artists like Frank Sinatra and Ella Fitzgerald.
Conte Candoli also worked in nightclubs and on concert stages. His wife, Kristen Candoli, said he continued to play in the United States and Europe until he fell ill in October.
Besides his wife and his brother, of Los Angeles, Mr. Candoli is survived by a daughter, Marcia, of Los Angeles; a stepdaughter, Marla Kapoor of Portland, Ore.; and a sister, Gloria Henke of Mishawaka.
Internet users in the United States were more likely to visit government Web sites than they were to handle banking or stock transactions online, according to a survey by the University of Maryland. About 55 percent of adults with access to the Internet visited a government Web site last year, the study found, and 21 percent said they conducted business with a government agency from their personal computer, including renewing vehicle registrations and paying taxes. By contrast, the survey, which was based on telephone interviews with 500 people, showed that 20 percent of Internet users made bank transactions online, 15 percent reported paying credit card bills and 10 percent said they traded stocks via the Web. ''This research suggests that e-government is in many ways even more prevalent than e-commerce,'' Roland Rust, director of the university's Center for e-Service, said in a statement. ''E-service appears to be an increasingly attractive alternative to standing in line at a government office.''
In its first enforcement action involving the abuse of so-called pro forma accounting, the Securities and Exchange Commission yesterday charged that Trump Hotels and Casino Inc. had ''recklessly'' misled shareholders in 1999.
Trump Hotels agreed to settle the charges and consented to the S.E.C.'s cease-and-desist order, acknowledging its findings without admitting or denying them. The company, whose chairman is Donald J. Trump, will not pay a fine.
In recent years, companies in many industries have emphasized their pro forma financial results as the preferred measure of their performance. Wall Street analysts have often accepted the companies' logic.
The pro forma numbers typically exclude costs involving mergers, interest, taxes and other charges. Pro forma calculations do not conform to generally accepted accounting principles, and the S.E.C.'s former chief accountant observed that pro forma statements tend to be ''E.B.S.'' accounting, for ''everything but bad stuff.''
The S.E.C. said last month that it was investigating several companies for pro forma abuses and would file civil fraud charges against violators.
The Trump Hotels case quickly attracted the attention of investigators. In announcing its third-quarter results in 1999, Trump Hotels said that its net income had more than doubled from the year-earlier quarter. Investors applauded, and the stock rose more than 8 percent on the news.
But within a couple of days, securities analysts began asking questions. It soon emerged that the quarterly rise in revenue and earnings was a result of loose, inventive accounting.
In September of that year, an Official All-Star Café pulled out of the Trump Taj Mahal casino in Atlantic City, and as part of the lease-termination contract, the casino was given some of the restaurant's fixtures and memorabilia.
Trump Hotels valued those assets at $17.2 million -- a one-time gain, but one that was nonetheless included as part of the company's quarterly revenue. So, as yesterday's cease-and-desist order explained, the Trump Hotels' revenue on a pro forma basis was $403 million and its pro forma net income was just under $14 million, or 63 cents a share.
Yet when the restaurant-transaction gain was excluded the actual revenue was $386 million and net income was $3 million, or 14 cents a share.
''The case starkly illustrates how pro forma numbers can be used deceptively and the mischief that can cause,'' said Stephen M. Cutler, director of the commission's enforcement division.
In the Trump Hotels case, the mischief quickly led to a government investigation, after Wayne M. Carlin, director of the commission's Northeast regional office in New York, read a news report about analysts questioning the company's accounting practices.
''We are not saying to companies, 'Don't use pro forma numbers,' '' Mr. Carlin explained. ''But we are saying, 'Don't use them in a way that is misleading.' ''
''If you put out a pro forma statement,'' he added, ''you need to explain in understandable terms what is included and what is not included.''
Jay Goldberg, a lawyer representing Mr. Trump and Trump hotels, pointed to the ''lenient'' terms of the settlement with no fine levied against the company as an indication that ''this was an isolated situation, and it occurred three years ago.''
The earnings statement was issued, Mr. Goldberg said, under the direction of Nicholas Ribis, a chief executive who is no longer with the hotel company. And the findings in the commission's order, he noted, ''failed to show that Donald Trump had any knowledge, consented to or was aware of this misconduct.''
The commission's order stated that in deciding to accept Trump Hotels' settlement offer, the government took into account ''the remedial acts promptly undertaken'' by the company and ''the limited duration of the violations.''
The Giuliani administration, known for keeping projects under wraps, seemed to have an especially heavy blanket reserved for the city-owned site at 2 Columbus Circle, the former Gallery of Modern Art.
Two requests for proposals were issued, in 1996 and 2000, with little public discussion and no apparent results. So after a flurry of activity in late December, several people familiar with the site concluded that the departing administration had quietly awarded it to Donald J. Trump, who has made no secret of his interest in replacing the 38-year-old structure with a small hotel, near his hotel at 1 Central Park West.
But Daniel L. Doctoroff, the deputy mayor for economic development, said last week that whatever happened -- and he would not get into specifics -- the Bloomberg administration was free to take a fresh look. ''Nothing got done at the end of the year that obliges the city in any way,'' he said, adding that he intended to focus on ''process, proposals and alternatives, and then decide how to proceed.''
The marble-clad building, designed by Edward Durell Stone, was lampooned when it opened but has since found admirers. Asked whether preserving the structure was one alternative, Mr. Doctoroff said it would be ''premature to comment in any direction.''
Mr. Trump said only, ''I do have a bid in and if I get it, it will be a wonderful project.''
At first, Mark Warren Sands says, it was a matter of pique. Someone was building a house in his upscale Phoenix suburb where Mr. Sands did not want it. So, he says, he burned it down.
But as one arson grew to eight, and as fear spread that Phoenix was under attack by eco-terrorists fighting residential sprawl, Mr. Sands, a laid-off public relations and marketing executive, began lighting fires seemingly to prove something to himself: that he still knew how to run a campaign.
''I knew what a good news story was; I knew how to sell it,'' he said in a recent prison interview as his sentencing approached. ''My drug was the news media coverage. There was the excitement of waiting for the media coverage to come out. There was a sense of power.''
Mr. Sands gained national attention by setting fires at construction sites adjoining two mountain preserves here from April 2000 to January 2001 and claiming, in notes at the crime scenes and in taunting letters to the press, that they were the work of a group he called the Coalition to Save the Preserves.
But one night last April he was arrested after defacing a sign at a construction site under surveillance. The police found saliva DNA linking him to letters sent to news organizations, and he confessed the arson to a friend who had been wired by investigators. In a plea agreement that called for a recommended prison term of 15 to 20 years, he admitted eight counts of extortion affecting interstate commerce and one count of use of fire to commit a felony.
Today the 50-year-old Mr. Sands, who is married and the father of two grown sons and a teenage daughter, was sentenced here to 18 years in prison by a federal district judge, Susan R. Bolton, who also ordered him to pay $2.8 million in restitution. Relatives and friends at the hearing read statements citing his history of community service, while victims articulated their loss and fear. Joseph C. Welty, a prosecutor in the case, said Mr. Sands's victims numbered many more than those who lost their houses.
''What he did was target a community at large,'' Mr. Welty said. ''And what did he get out of it? Ego gratification. The ability to manipulate what would be on the news. The ability to play cat and mouse with law enforcement.''
Mr. Sands had agreed to the prison interview on the condition that nothing he said be published until after his sentencing. He said he did not want to risk making any remark that might adversely affect his standing with the judge.
Sitting behind a glass partition at the Central Arizona Detention Center in nearby Florence, he recalled, ''At first, it was a small, personal, limited-to-the-neighborhood environmental protest.'' He set that first fire on April 9, 2000, at a large home under construction near the Phoenix Mountain Preserve, because, he said, the house was spoiling his favorite jogging trail. As he saw it, ''that was my land -- that was my entrance to the preserve.''
''The house was a direct affront to me personally,'' said Mr. Sands, himself the owner of a modest house bordering the preserve.
When the owner of the destroyed home announced that he would rebuild, Mr. Sands scrawled a message on a construction sign at the site. ''U Build -- We Burn Agin,'' he wrote, using the ''we'' and a misspelling in hopes the police would believe that the fire had been set by a youthful environmental group. On Oct. 1, 2000, he found the site unguarded and again set the home ablaze.
The local press pounced on the story of a mysterious arsonist with an anti-development agenda. The attention, Mr. Sands said, thrilled and inspired him.
''A light went on: 'I've got a campaign,' '' he said. ''I thought I could say something about the uncontrolled development. I didn't think that this was private land and I was being a hypocrite.''
Local investigators brought in the Federal Bureau of Investigation for assistance and placed the Phoenix Mountain Preserve, a 26,000-acre recreation park, under surveillance. Homeowners and developers raised a $76,200 reward and encircled their properties adjacent to the preserve with barbed wire and floodlights.
Mr. Sands came to view his arson as a risky, criminal substitute for his derailed marketing career. (He had lost his job as director of marketing for a Phoenix health care organization in June 2000.) In messages to the news media, he identified the Coalition to Save the Preserves as an eclectic foursome of mountain bikers. The point of the deception, he said, was ''to make it a bigger story, more exciting.''
He became increasingly at ease with his crimes. Once, he said, he set a fire after refereeing a high school soccer match. Another time, he went to a holiday party, set a fire, then did some Christmas shopping at a mall.
But by early last year, the fires, which had initially attracted some sympathy from people who felt that too much development had infringed on Arizona's virgin desert, were drawing decidedly negative publicity. News accounts about his distraught victims, and the death of a Phoenix fireman in an unrelated blaze, persuaded him to end his campaign, Mr. Sands said.
Yet he could not resist leaving one last message. On April 20, three months after his last attack, he was arrested for writing on a property sign that pledged an environmentally sensitive residential development.
Press coverage has long since lost its appeal, particularly now that his family knows of his crimes.
''I feel for the fire victims,'' Mr. Sands said, ''but the real victims are my wife, my daughter, my sons. The hell that I've created for people who care about me is almost unimaginable.''
For several years now, Donald J. Trump has been pursuing ambitious plans to build four golf courses in the suburbs north of New York City. But he confirmed today that he had dropped two of those projects.
Mr. Trump said in a telephone interview that he had withdrawn a plan for a 155-acre golf course in Yorktown in northern Westchester after more than four years of trying to get local approval. He also said that he was no longer pursuing a proposed 300-acre golf course just across the Putnam County line in the town of Putnam Valley.
Mr. Trump said he had lost interest in building the Yorktown course because of the long process of securing the town's approval, coupled with a real estate market that he said had made the land more desirable for housing.
''I think the approval process in Westchester is even more difficult than the approval process in Manhattan,'' Mr. Trump said. ''But in a perverse way, they've done me a favor because the land has gotten more valuable.''
Mr. Trump has succeeded with one of his four projects: the recently completed Trump National Golf Club, on 198 acres in nearby Briarcliff Manor. He said the course was so good that he was concerned that he could not replicate it.
Linda Cooper, the Yorktown supervisor, said that town officials had tried to work closely with Mr. Trump to address a host of environmental concerns about the golf course. She said that the town would welcome the golf course if it could be built without harming the environment, and that officials had been waiting for Mr. Trump to respond to specific issues -- not the other way around.
''It strikes me that Mr. Trump decided for other reasons he didn't want to build the golf course anymore and was looking for an excuse,'' she said.
Mr. Trump's proposals for a golf course in Yorktown and another on a 213-acre estate in Bedford and New Castle have drawn fierce opposition from some residents and environmental groups who charge that building them near environmentally fragile wetlands, and maintaining them with fertilizers, would pollute their drinking water supplies. The Bedford project is still moving forward, Mr. Trump said.
Jim Tierney, an assistant state attorney general who serves as New York City's watershed inspector general, said that the proposed golf course in Yorktown would have been within a mile or so of the New Croton Reservoir, an unfiltered drinking water source for 900,000 city and county residents. ''Once something gets into the drinking water, it doesn't get filtered out,'' he said. ''It comes out of the faucet.''
Mr. Trump dismissed any suggestion today that he had been thwarted in his efforts to expand his real estate empire to Westchester. He said he would either sell the properties in Yorktown and Putnam Valley to residential developers for a hefty profit, or submit an alternative plan himself for subdivisions.
He added that the two undeveloped properties had only grown in value, to about $15 million and $20 million, and that he had already received 10 offers for each of them. ''They did me a favor because I'll make more money,'' he said. ''That's not being thwarted.''
This week, Donald J. Trump announced that he would cancel his plans to build two golf courses planned for the Westchester area. He dropped a proposed 155-acre golf course in Yorktown, and plans for a course on a 300-acre plot in Putnam Valley. Mr. Trump said that his other two golf course projects -- the Trump National Golf Club in Briarcliff Manor, and another planned for a 213-acre estate in Bedford -- would move forward.
Mr. Trump said that he would develop the land into residential housing, or sell it to a developer. He blamed Yorktown officials for delaying his project with a strict approval process. But Linda Cooper, the Yorktown supervisor, said that Mr. Trump never fully addressed town and state environmental requirements.
''I suspect that his decision had very little to do with us, but was rather a business decision he had to make,'' she said on Thursday. Corey Kilgannon
Most of the early authorities on contract bridge began with auction and then converted to the new game. One was Sidney Lenz, who had many talents, including magic. He was not, however, a magician in bidding theory, for, with one exception, he did not believe in forcing bids. This confused his partners, particularly in the Culbertson-Lenz match.
His one exception was a response of three of a major to a one no-trump opening. For three decades this was a simple bid, showing a five-card suit and asking opener to choose an appropriate game. After the introduction of transfer bids in the 50's, a jump bid of three hearts or three spades became a mystery. A responder with a five-card major would usually use a transfer sequence.
A possible meaning is a strong suit with slam interest. Another is a five-five distribution in the major suits, with three hearts invitational and three spades forcing. Some use it as a splinter to show a short suit with no major. Others employ it to show a three-suiter short in the other major. And a few make use of the anti-lemming devised by this columnist: a three-card suit with a weak doubleton in the other major.
In the diagramed deal, played in New York Regional Championships two weeks ago, the agreement was that the three-heart bid allowed North to use his discretion. North was the veteran star Ivar Stakgold, whose opening one no-trump bid showed 12 to 14 points. With flat distribution he might have chosen three no-trump, but raised to four hearts. His partner, Adam Wildavsky, faced difficult problems.
A diamond was led to the ace and the suit was returned. South took his king, fearing that a finesse of the jack would lead to a third-round ruff by East. The king and ace of hearts were cashed, and the diamond jack was led. When West won with the queen he was in some difficulty and did the best he could by shifting to the spade jack. This rode around to the king, and South continued by playing a spade to dummy's seven.
East returned the heart ten, and dummy won, reaching this position:

Wildavsky knew the spade ace was on his right and was confident the ten was on his left. Barring the faint chance that West had led the spade jack lacking the ten, declarer was now sure of success if, as seemed likely, West held the club king.
Wildavsky led the spade queen from dummy and ruffed when East played the ace. When the ten appeared, dummy's eight was established and the club finesse made the game. If the spade ten had not appeared, Wildavsky would have led his last trump to squeeze West.
After four years, the first long-term retail lease has been signed at Trump Place, the large luxury residential complex south of 72nd Street on the Upper West Side of Manhattan near the Hudson River. Two other potential tenants are negotiating with the developer. But for now, almost all of the 33,500 square feet of retail space in the complex's first three buildings remains empty.
The story of how the developers have gone about trying to fill the space, and the fact that they have rejected potential tenants, illustrates the problems faced in attracting the right retailers to a so far largely isolated location where the prime emphasis has been on finding residential tenants and buyers for the rental and condominium apartments.
''Retail has always been the tail wagging the dog here,'' said Jeffrey D. Roseman, an executive vice president of Newmark New Spectrum Retail, which is representing the developers, Donald J. Trump and Hudson Waterfront Associates, a partnership, with headquarters in Hong Kong, comprising several major international developers. ''While the developers were marketing the buildings they weren't focused on renting the retail space. There's hundreds of millions of dollars invested in the upstairs space,'' he said.
''But there's been plenty of retail activity. We get calls all the time. It's such a natural alternative to the $200 or $250-a-square foot annual rents on Broadway or Columbus Avenue. But we have to be selective. We don't want to have an unsightly laundromat downstairs.''
The new tenant, Renaissance Fine Wines and Spirits, agreed in December to lease 2,000 square feet for 10 years at 160 Riverside Boulevard, at 67th Street, and is planning to open in the spring.
The other potential tenants -- Jubilee Market, an upscale, service-oriented market that has a store at 99 John Street downtown, and a branch of the Outback Steakhouse chain -- are considering space at 180 Riverside Boulevard, at 68th Street, Mr. Roseman said.
All the retail space is along Freedom Place, at the back of the buildings, in the eastern corner of the development, the side closest to West End Avenue. The annual rent being asked for ground floor space is $55 a square foot.
Plans call for Trump Place to have 16 residential buildings and 17,000 residents eventually. So far, three buildings are open -- two rental and one condominium -- with 1,348 apartments. Two new buildings -- one rental and one condominium -- with 795 apartments are scheduled to open later this year.
Earlier negotiations for retail space with Outback Steakhouse fell through last year, Mr. Roseman said, but have resumed. ''The first goal is to get a market,'' he said. ''If you polled the people who live here they would probably say the first thing they would want is a market. But the reality is that a restaurant brings life, traffic, people from outside the complex. We want both, and we'll have both.''
Mr. Roseman said that other retailers were especially interested in the space at the corner of 70th Street and Freedom Place, at the back of the condominium at 200 Riverside Boulevard. ''That's where the sales office is,'' he said. ''Everyone wants it because it's the first thing you see when you arrive at the site, and it's visible from 70th Street and West End Avenue.''
But, Mr. Roseman said, caution was the byword. ''The prime concern is what we have upstairs,'' he said. ''Plenty of drugstores wanted the space, chains and local ones,'' he said. ''But it's not exactly the image we wanted when trying to sell apartments. Mr. Trump felt that when people looking to buy a $1 million apartment turn the corner to come here, we didn't want the first thing they see to be a drugstore.''
What they are hoping to attract, Mr. Roseman said, is ''something more like a home furnishings or furniture store.''
''It's still an isolated space,'' he said, ''and a national chain clothing store could never see its way to being here. Most retailers considering us are savvy New York-based guys who understand that there are a lot of people near here.''
Other real estate brokers are less sanguine. ''There's a serious problem with retail there because it's so isolated,'' said Alan Victor, executive vice president of the Lansco Corporation, a brokerage company specializing in retail and office spaces. ''There are only two ways of getting in, at 66th and West End and 70th and West End. A small convenience supermarket would work, or other service-oriented stores. But if they could create something out of the ordinary, a destination use like a Ralph Lauren factory outlet store, that might also work.''
The first new retailer, though, is happy with its decision. Cris Zukowski, the principal owner of Renaissance Fine Wines and Spirits, said he had searched the city for ''a location that offered good growth prospects and a competitive rent, and Trump Place meets all those needs in spades.''
''It's a brand-new residential neighborhood in the heart of Manhattan, and it's going to develop into a much larger community,'' he said.
For Mr. Roseman, patience is the key. ''You would have got several hundred thousand dollars a year in rent if the space had been leased,'' he said, ''but you wouldn't have attained the prices upstairs if it wasn't a good use downstairs. If you can hold out, it pays. Because the property is only going to get better as more buildings go up.''
New York may be a thoroughly modern city, but it still has neighborhoods with no sewers. Private homes in places like Douglas Manor, Queens, and Rossville, Staten Island, still send waste water into underground septic systems. But contrary to what you might assume, as city sewers are extended to those areas, some homeowners say they would rather not hook up to them.
''We are content with the way things are,'' said Joan Corbisiero, president of the Douglas Manor Association. She and her neighbors looked on in dismay when the city installed a sewer line in nearby Douglaston in 1998 and then sent letters to hundreds of homeowners telling them they had six months to connect to the line or face a one-time $5,000 fine and subsequent fines of $1,000 a day.
Melanie McGillick, who lives in a century-old colonial in Douglaston, said many of her neighbors were upset about having only six months to raise the $5,000 necessary to install the new pipes.
''There was a petition going around,'' she said, ''because it was really unfair to not have time to save up.'' But Charles G. Sturcken, a spokesman at the city's Department of Environmental Protection said that ''with that neighborhood, we were pretty lenient.'' Homeowners were granted extensions and referred to agencies that helped them secure low-cost loans for the work.
The city has recently spent $170 million a year to add new lines to its 6,000-mile sewer system because old septic systems, in which water is sent to an underground tank, can fail and foul their surroundings, Mr. Sturcken said.
Opinions on the subject are decidedly mixed.
The McGillicks of Douglaston, who have two children, are glad they connected their house to the sewer system.
''You really can't live in a modern way with a septic tank,'' she said. ''You have to shower briefly and wash only one load of laundry in a day, or the tank will overflow.''
Ms. Corbisiero disagreed. She said she and her husband had raised two boys in their hilltop house, which has a septic tank and an overflow tank, and used all the water they wanted.
''A lot depends on the maintenance,'' she said. ''A lot of people don't think you need sewers if you take care of your septic tank.'' JIM O'GRADY
Three days from now, Mayor Sharpe James will push a dummy plunger and watch as three hulking structures disappear in a cloud of dust.
The implosion of the Stella Wright Homes, once the shame of this famously blighted city, will mark the end of a troubled era in high-rise public housing here and pave the way for what is billed as a quite different vision: a sprawling $200 million collection of neo-colonial town houses, gracious parkland, a new high school and a library.
For the mayor, Saturday morning's demolition will serve as a fitting symbol of a political career that has seen Newark go from a byword for urban despair to an intriguing place positioned somewhere between the decay of the 70's and 80's and the renaissance Mr. James sees as his legacy.
On his watch, 40 brick behemoths have been dynamited, an ailing downtown has pulsed with new life, and thousands of homes have sprouted on a landscape once scarred by riots and abandonment.
''When I became mayor in 1986, you couldn't say the word Newark without embarrassment,'' he said from the faded splendor of City Hall, an architectural showpiece that, like most of Newark, awaits restoration. ''Today, people are proud to say they live in Newark. We've gone from urban blight to urban bright.''
But 16 years after he unseated an four-term incumbent with the promise of boundless prosperity, the mayor most residents simply know as Sharpe is fending off a challenger who is wielding the same argument he used against Kenneth Gibson, Newark's first black mayor. Like Sharpe James in 1986, Mr. James's opponent, Cory Booker, says the current mayor has served long enough.
After three decades as a political mainstay in New Jersey's largest city, Mr. James is clearly unnerved by his younger, better-financed opponent, a 32-year-old Rhodes scholar who arrived here in 1996, promptly won a seat on the City Council and then cultivated a national reputation as an up-and-coming innovator. A proud, sometimes imperious man, Mr. James calls his rival disrespectful, and views his candidacy as an affront to the mayor's hard-fought victories.
''Cory Booker has done nothing for Newark,'' Mr. James said with contempt. ''He has no record of achievement, no commitment to the people, no love for Newark.''
Like Newark itself, the incumbent can be read in many ways, but no one doubts his love for the city. It is a mutual admiration, readily apparent whenever the 66-year-old mayor is on the street, where he is greeted with kisses, handshakes and countless requests for mayoral intervention.
''You've seen us through the good and the bad,'' said Martha Johnston, 74, as Mr. James worked a center for the elderly in the Central Ward one recent afternoon. ''We're not going to let you down, not ever.''
But Newark's by-the-bootstraps patriarch and most prominent defender is also an imperfect leader whose triumphs and stumbles mirror this city's harrowing downfall and wobbly rebirth.
''I don't know many people in this country who have sustained themselves through so much political turmoil,'' said Walter Fields, a campaign consultant and former head of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People in New Jersey. ''He hasn't come through unscathed, but he managed to walk through the flames a survivor.''
A fast-moving man with a gravelly voice and gap-toothed grin, Mr. James maintains his smile even when absorbing unpleasant news. In the early years of his administration, he took on the comics and columnists who treated Newark as a punching bag. He once called up Phil Donahue after the talk show host made disparaging remarks about the city. Mr. Donahue apologized on the air.
In the late 1990's, Mr. James kept his composure as a series of federal corruption investigations took aim at City Hall. Mr. James's chief of staff, the police director and two Council members were eventually convicted of wrongdoing, but the mayor was never indicted. He consolidated his power and went on to win a seat in the State Senate in addition to the mayoralty.
Mr. James is supremely confident in his achievements and begins every public appearance with a list of cheery facts and figures: crime down 52 percent; 30,000 new jobs; and a downtown arts center and minor league baseball stadium that many critics said would never be built.
''Newark is not heaven on earth,'' he said, strolling through his City Hall office, its walls lined with scores of groundbreaking shovels. ''We still have our problems, but I think what I've done is an inspiration to every mayor in America.''
Mr. James's battle against Mr. Booker is a battle between a political leader molded during the civil rights years of the 60's and one able to reap that era's rewards. Mr. Booker graduated from Stanford, Oxford and Yale Universities, and by his own account, never faced discrimination or economic adversity.
By contrast, Mr. James's mother, Beulah Fluker, raised her two sons alone in a racially divided city, their home a cold-water apartment with a potbellied stove and a backyard outhouse.
''The thing about Sharpe that appeals to so many of us is he struggled to get out of poverty, got himself an education and fought to find acceptance by doing the right thing,'' said Representative Donald M. Payne, a Newark Democrat who first met Mr. James in the mid-1960's. ''He comes from the first generation of black men who were privileged to go to college.''
Mr. James, who was born in Jacksonville, Fla., never knew his father, who died of pneumonia before his birth. Ms. Fluker fled an abusive second husband and took her sons north, eventually settling in central Newark.
After serving in the Army and graduating from Montclair State College, Mr. James became a college physical education instructor and joined an emerging movement among young African-Americans to gain a political foothold in a city dominated by Italian-Americans. As he tells it, even during the 1967 riots, he tried to stop a mob by telling them: ''You can't win by force. We'll win with the ballot box.''
Three years later, he was part of a slate that catapulted Mr. Gibson to the mayoralty and Mr. James to a seat on the Council. A civil engineer by training, Mr. Gibson brought stability to Newark, but after four terms in office, many residents were troubled by a sense that Newark's resurgence had hit a wall.
''Gibson had stopped a calamitous downward spiral, but there was no up,'' said Michael Redmond, 52, then a music critic for The Star-Ledger and the organizer of a community group. ''There was a restlessness throughout the city, and here was Sharpe James, vibrant and dynamic.''
Where Mr. Gibson was placid, and at times passive, Mr. James was a whirl of optimism. Mr. James, whose slogan was ''Sharpe Change,'' won in a landslide.
''We thought it was a real beginning,'' said Claude Coleman, a superior court judge who was in the fledgling James administration, first as fire director, then police director. ''Sharpe was like a new promise for rebirth and we were proud to be in the vanguard of change.''
Mr. James reinstated the mounted police units, streamlined the city's permit process and became a one-man cheerleading squad, talking up the city to anyone who would listen. He knows how to massage a crowd, throwing out snippets of Yiddish, Spanish or Italian, depending on his audience. ''Ken would show up at an event, say a few words and leave,'' Mr. Coleman said. ''Sharpe would schmooze everyone, stay for the whole party, and be the last one to leave.''
His persuasiveness helped woo corporate tenants to a once-ghostly downtown, among them the telecommunications company IDT, Blue Cross-Blue Shield and Verizon. He trumpeted Newark as the logical home for the state's performing arts center. He coined the phrase Newark Renaissance, and made it stick.
''There would be no arts center in Newark without Sharpe James,'' said Lawrence Goldman, its executive director. ''Once he's convinced of something, he's a real bulldog.''
But that same tenacity can also be directed at his enemies, earning Mr. James a reputation as a bulldog who does not tolerate disloyalty or dissent. ''Sharpe is fiery, competitive and he plays to win,'' said Senator Ronald L. Rice, a longtime friend who made the mistake of challenging him for mayor in 1998. ''You don't want him as your enemy.''
Mr. James has also been criticized for his $248,000 salary, making him the highest-paid elected official in the state, and for turning City Hall into a patronage center for friends and allies. Liz Del Tufo, the retired director of the Newark Boys Choir, who volunteered on his first campaign, said the quality of the mayor's inner circle has harmed Newark.
''He's got some very good people around him and he's got some terribly mediocre people around him,'' she said. ''As a result, City Hall doesn't operate as efficiently as it could.''
With less than three weeks before the election, Mr. James is counting on help from the state's top elected officials, eager for Newark votes, and residents thankful for their municipal jobs.
But to win another term and become the longest-serving mayor in Newark history, Mr. James will have to convince a wider audience that he still has vision and dynamism. He will also have to defend his integrity and accomplishments against an opponent as skilled and politically nimble as he is.
''Lose?'' he asked, responding to the question of what life after City Hall might entail. ''That's not even an option.''
But he seemed especially troubled by the notion that someone younger and less experienced than he could take his place.
''You don't fix something that's not broke,'' he said. ''You don't change horses in the middle of the race.''
Suppose that you land in an unlikely three no-trump, in which contract the opponents can take the first six tricks. Your combined hands offer a borderline play for a grand slam in either of two suits, with a small slam a virtual certainty.
That seems a recipe for disaster, but you emerge with a top score. In addition you can claim a world record, admittedly one that has not been in the spotlight before.
The occasion was a Stratified Open Pairs at the Long Island Regional Championships in February. Sitting North-South were Janet and Mel Colchamiro of Merrick, N.Y., one of the country's best mixed partnerships.
North-South were using a strong-club system with an artificial one-diamond bid. The opening showed 10-15 high-card points with a void or singleton somewhere in the hand, perhaps in diamonds. East attempted to mix things up with a weak jump overcall, but not in diamonds. He bid two hearts, a remarkable psychic effort. This succeeded up to a point, for it maneuvered his opponents into the wrong contract.
South believed the two-heart bid, and judged that three no-trump would be a sound contract if, as seemed probable, his partner's short suit was hearts. Unfortunately for East, his partner also believed the two-heart bid, and obediently led that suit.
South inspected the dummy in astonishment and made two discoveries. First, the opponents could have taken at least six speedy tricks in diamonds. Second, he had missed a slam in hearts or clubs.
Pulling himself together, he won the first trick with dummy's heart queen. He then ran five rounds of clubs and West, confused by the bidding, parted with a heart and three spades. This made it easy for the declarer to take three more heart winners, ending in dummy, and finesse the spade jack. This added up to 13 tricks, for a score of 520.
At other tables, the North-South partnerships found their heart fit but had to face energetic diamond bidding by their opponents. They were unable to determine that the fit was perfect for slam purposes, and all rested in four or five hearts. That gave the Colchamiro family a top matchpoint score, with 520 against a string of 510's. Whether this was fully deserved is questionable.
Mel Colchamiro now claims a world record for participating in an auction with the fewest number of total cards held by the bidders in their own suits: one.
''To beat this,'' he said, ''someone will have to void-void me in the auction. I'm betting no one ever will!''
SIX months after threatening to default on junk bonds issued by his three Atlantic City casinos, Donald Trump is back, marketing a new deal to investors.
Mr. Trump hopes to raise $470 million in new junk bonds this week, refinancing debt that will mature next year with bonds that will not come due until 2010. Mr. Trump is seeking to take advantage of some strong results at his casinos and a revival in demand for new junk bond offerings after a slump in issuance last fall.
Analysts and investors said that it made sense for Mr. Trump to refinance the debt but that it took some nerve. After all, in late October Mr. Trump was arguing that an ailing economy and the expectation of new competition meant gloomy prospects for his casinos. Citing hard times, Mr. Trump tried to persuade bondholders to accept lower interest rates on some of his casinos' outstanding debt. He even threatened to default on the bonds, although he ultimately paid the interest owed.
Now Mr. Trump is painting an optimistic picture for his casinos.
''Donald is a master salesman,'' said J. Philip Rosen, a partner at the law firm of Weil, Gotshal & Manges, which was retained last fall to represent holders of $1.3 billion in bonds issued by Trump Atlantic City that come due in 2006. ''Back then, he was trying to sell negative news. Good news is easier to sell -- and more believable -- than bad news.''
In an interview yesterday, Mr. Trump said that circumstances had changed.
''After Sept. 11, I assumed there would be no bond market,'' he said. ''What has happened is the gaming market kicked in strongly.''
Ted Meyer, a spokesman for Deutsche Bank, the underwriter for the offering, declined to comment.
Mr. Trump's casinos, like other gambling companies, have posted strong results over the last few months, thanks in part to unseasonably warm weather. Cash flow at Mr. Trump's Marina casino, formerly known as Trump's Castle, was reported at $14.7 million in the first quarter, a 62 percent increase over the period a year earlier. At a riverboat casino he owns in Gary, Ind., cash flow also increased, to $8 million from $6.8 million.
The new bonds, issued by an entity called Trump Casino Holdings, will be secured by the assets of these two properties, according to a prospectus distributed to institutional investors. The bonds will not be backed by Mr. Trump's other Atlantic City casinos: the Trump Taj Mahal and the Trump Plaza.
Strong results at most casinos have made junk bonds as well as stock issued by these companies popular with investors this year. According to Jacques Cornet, an analyst with CIBC World Markets, casino bonds are up 7.4 percent through the end of April, twice the return of the overall junk bond market.
The biggest casino company stocks are up 39 percent, according to a recent report issued by Jason Ader, a Bear, Stearns & Company analyst, while smaller casino shares rose nearly 34 percent through the end of last month. In contrast, the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index fell 7 percent in the period.
At the same time, investors are hungry for new junk bond offerings, which many had shunned after the terror attacks last September. About $30 billion in junk bonds were sold to investors in the first four months of 2002, according to Credit Suisse First Boston. That is down slightly from the corresponding period last year but an improvement over the $27.4 billion sold in the last half of 2001.
More than three-quarters of the offerings this year have been from companies, like Mr. Trump's casinos, that are looking to refinance bonds, bank loans or some other form of debt, said Jonathan Blau, a director of global leveraged finance research at Credit Suisse.
Still, Mr. Trump's recent behavior could make the bonds a tough sell, analysts and investors said.
''How do you trust a manager who withholds the interest he owes because he doesn't like the terms of his debt?'' said Barbara Cappaert, an analyst with KDP Investment Advisors, a research firm.
Other analysts think Mr. Trump will probably be able to sell the bonds, although at a higher rate than other casino companies might pay. Some holders of the debt maturing next year will be persuaded to buy the new bonds, to guarantee that Mr. Trump pays off the old debt. Other investors will be enticed by a high yield.
Prices quoted for the bonds coming due next year indicate some traders are worried that Mr. Trump might not succeed. He plans to use the money he raises to pay bondholders par, or 100 cents on the dollar. But traders are quoting these bonds at about 95 cents, analysts said.
''The market is saying there is some level of uncertainty about whether this deal gets done,'' Mr. Cornet said.
The state's highest court ruled that Acting Gov. Jane M. Swift lacked the power to fire two members of the Massachusetts Turnpike Authority in February. Ms. Swift fired the members after they voted to delay by six months a scheduled toll increase on the turnpike. At the time, the governor said that the board members were fiscally irresponsible. The Supreme Judicial Court said that the dispute appeared to involve a difference of opinion, which was not sufficient reason to remove members of an independent state authority. Pam Belluck (NYT)
In the last days leading up to Sierra Leone's first elections since its brutal civil war, ebullient crowds have filled the streets downtown, dancing, singing and sweating in the swelter that blankets Freetown just before the rains.
''Wu teh teh!'' many cry. ''Everything is plentiful!''
Foday Sankoh, the rebel leader whose forces spread terror by slicing off people's hands, is a fading memory. The once mythic bush fighter has been reduced to a small imprisoned figure in dreadlocks who speaks incoherently and refuses to bathe. ''Mentally imbalanced,'' as the current leader of his party put it.
To anyone who witnessed the invasion of Freetown in January 1999, which left thousands of bodies on these same streets, the jubilant throngs were a clear sign of how much things have changed in this West African nation. Only two years ago, Sierra Leone teetered on the edge as the rebels outsmarted a helpless and humiliated United Nations peacekeeping force.
But after huge investments from Western nations, peace was declared in January this year. The rebels have been vanquished; British-trained soldiers of the new army and United Nations troops are stationed across the land, including the diamond mines that fueled the conflict. The elections on Tuesday, if they go smoothly, are expected to lead to the phasing out over the next year of the United Nations force of 17,400.
Whether Sierra Leone can survive without that umbrella is the question that looms over the elections. Despite the governing party's campaign slogan -- ''Wu teh teh!'' -- the war has destroyed nearly everything in this country.
''The peace that we have achieved in the country remains fragile,'' said Margaret Novicki, spokeswoman for the United Nations mission, adding that former militiamen have continued to dig for diamonds in the east.
Alan Doss, the United Nations deputy special representative for governance and stabilization, speaks of ''fault lines'' that were at the roots of the war and that could derail peace: corrupt government and diamonds, which enriched only an elite.
Despite a few skirmishes, the presidential and parliamentary campaign has been peaceful. In 1996, rebels reacted to losing by cutting off the hands of people who had voted against them.
About 2.3 million people, perhaps half the population, have registered to vote, but there has been little voter education. ''A lot of people don't know that elections are taking place,'' Johann van Hecke, the leader of the European Union's observation mission, said of rural areas.
But here in the capital, political parties have held daily rallies in the last week.
''This time it's different -- it's not like 1996,'' said Sheku Bangura, 48, who was attending a rally last week. ''No violence. No intimidation. No kidnapping. These are real elections for Sierra Leone's future.''
President Ahmed Tejan Kabbah is expected to be re-elected. He has always depended on outsiders for survival, first the West African peacekeepers, led by Nigerians, then the United Nations and Britain. Most Sierra Leoneans, though, regard him as personally honest, unlike other members of his Sierra Leone People's Party.
Mr. Kabbah, like many of the eight other presidential candidates, portrays himself as best qualified to keep the peace. ''This peace which we have -- are you ready to take chances with somebody who hasn't got the experience?'' he said at a huge rally on Saturday.
He pleaded for tolerance, particularly toward the former fighters. ''All ex-combatants who have come forward begging for forgiveness,'' he said, ''let us receive them as brothers and sisters.''
With politics now leading to power, transformations have taken place, though how deep they are remains unclear.
Johnny Paul Koroma, a warlord who was an army officer, has undergone the most remarkable metamorphosis. He became unpopular after staging a coup in 1997, allying himself with the rebels and leading soldiers responsible for many atrocities. In May 2000 he switched sides and, in many people's eyes, saved Freetown from the rebels.
Now he is back as a born-again Christian leader of his own Peace and Liberation Party.
His rally last week was an often surreal mix. Cries of ''Jesus!'' mixed with less polite cries from former rebels visibly drunk or high on drugs. ''Vote for the Angel. J. P. Koroma,'' read many T-shirts. ''Flap for the angel!'' cried one emotional supporter, flapping his arms.
When Mr. Koroma arrived, it became clear that he had shed the most colorful reminders of his rebel past.
One regular bodyguard -- an always friendly man called Hiroshima Bomb, who usually wore a skirt and tank top over mountains of muscles and a necklace of ammunition rounds -- was nowhere in sight. Mr. Bomb lost his job to new bodyguards, who got into a shoving match with other supporters and were sweating heavily in their black leather jackets.
In an interview, Mr. Koroma said he alone could guarantee peace. ''I'm a Christian,'' he said. ''My running mate is a Muslim. We are men of God.'' He added he would provide full employment, medical care and free schooling.
A few blocks away, the rebel party's candidate, Pallo Bangura, brushed away such pledges, saying, ''Most Sierra Leoneans know those are empty promises.'' He added that the only priority was peace, which, he said, only his party could secure.
Mr. Bangura said he had been unaware of the rebels' atrocities but he acknowledged a problem, saying: ''It's a fact that most fingers point at the R.U.F. in terms of atrocities and amputations. It's something we have to cope with.''
The challenge in rebuilding Sierra Leone can be measured at a military camp on Freetown's outskirts, where former rebels and pro-government militiamen are being trained together for the new army.
About 2,300 troops have gone through a nine-week training course supervised by British officers. Maj. David Estyn-Jones listed their strengths (''fit,'' ''enthusiastic,'' ''tolerant'') and their weaknesses (''lack of grit,'' ''corrupt'').
Last week, at an early voting day for the military, former enemies lined up together to cast ballots.
''Peace will stay depending on how the government will rule,'' said Khalitalul Stevens, a former pro-government militiaman in his 30's. ''If the government makes the same mistakes as before, there will be a problem.''
But, he said, ''in Sierra Leone, our paramount expectation is peace.''
Failing to entice the financial markets, Donald J. Trump canceled a $470 million sale of bonds for his casinos yesterday because investors were demanding such high interest rates.
Investors have been willing to accept much lower rates on bonds of other casinos, but Mr. Trump's threat last fall to default on the debt of three of his Atlantic City casinos apparently left a bitter taste. At the time, Mr. Trump tried to force existing bondholders to accept a lower rate given the gloomy economic atmosphere after Sept. 11. He missed a deadline on an interest payment, but ultimately gave in and paid bondholders before the end of the grace period without securing a lower rate.
''That's a piece of it,'' said Mark A. Brown, president of Trump Hotels and Casino Resorts, which canceled the bond sale; it owns the Trump Plaza, Taj Mahal and Marina properties. If the bonds could have been sold at an interest rate closer to those on other casino bonds, he said, the sale would have gone through.
Mr. Brown and Mr. Trump said they expected to proceed with a bond sale later in the year when the casinos' performance would merit a better deal. ''I am confident that a more attractive financing will be available to the company towards the end of this year,'' Mr. Trump said in a statement.
The planned offering of eight-year notes had been expected to yield 9.75 percent to 10 percent on a higher-rated $340 million portion and 12.75 percent to 13 percent on a $130 million portion, which carried a lower rating, according to investors interested in the proposal.
The market has generally been receptive, with the average yield on casino junk bonds at 8.5 percent, according to Merrill Lynch's high-yield index. And investors have been pouring money into junk bond mutual funds at twice the pace of a year ago, reflecting appetite for this high-yielding but risky debt.
''It is a great time for a junk bond issuer to issue,'' said Martin S. Fridson, chief high-yield strategist at Merrill Lynch. ''And casinos are pretty much in favor right now.''
Casino junk bond issues are yielding less, on average, than other junk bonds, Mr. Fridson said. Bond prices and yields move in the opposite direction, so a lower yield shows that investors want casino bonds enough to pay more for them. The junk bonds for casinos usually have a yield of a full percentage point less than all junk bonds, but right now, they are yielding three percentage points less, indicating strong demand, he said.
The proceeds from the sale by Mr. Trump's company were earmarked to pay off shorter-term debt. The company said in a statement that $67 million is due April 30 of next year but described it as ''readily finance-able.'' A bigger portion, $242 million, comes due Nov. 15, 2003.
Trump Hotels and Casino Resorts made a considerable effort to warm investors on the bond issue. Mr. Brown said that Mr. Trump attended all the ''roadshow'' meetings with investors, and the terms were modified. At first, it was a single issue of $470 million, backed by the assets of the Trump Marina Casino Resort in Atlantic City and the Riverboat Casino in Indiana. When the expected yield was too high, two issues were created. The $340 million portion represented mortgage bonds that had first call on the casino assets. It was rated B- by Standard & Poor's and B3 by Moody's Investors Service. The other portion was a second-mortgage issue, with less security, that was rated CCC by S.& P. and Ca by Moody's.
Just this week, Trump Hotels and Casino Resorts added more assets to the lower-rated issue by pledging the revenues of the Trump 29 Casino, an Indian casino that Mr. Trump's organization manages in Palm Springs, Calif.
Most of New York's experts gathered Tuesday at the Harmonie Club, 4 East 64th Street, for the world's most successful charity event. This 39th annual effort, with an organizing team headed by Marci Miron, raised more than $85,000 for UJA-Federation.
The winners were Dolores Saltzman and Jared Lilienstein, both of Manhattan, with 66.82 percent. Second, with 64.09 percent, were Suellen Solodar of Manhattan and Rozanne Pollack of Warren, N.J.
The diagramed deal attracted considerable attention. At nearly all tables the bidding began as shown in the diagram, but South contented himself with three no-trump at his third turn, well aware that he had something in reserve and might be missing a slam.
In one case, however, R. Jay Becker was more courageous. After three diamonds he leaped directly to six diamonds without making any effort to ask for aces. He was rewarded when the dummy provided the missing aces, but even so it was not immediately obvious that 12 tricks were available.
Luckily for South, the lead was a heart, won with the ace over the queen. The declarer led to the spade ace in dummy, cashed the club ace and ruffed a club.
He then led the spade queen and removed West's king with a ruff. Another club was ruffed, and the spade jack was led for a ruff and an overruff. A heart lead to the king left this position:
Becker continued to crossruff merrily in the black suits to make his slam. West discovered, too late, that he should have led a trump originally, cutting down on the crossruff and defeating the slam.
Was six diamonds unbeatable? Yes and no. It would have been unbeatable if North had been the declarer, since East would not have been able to lead a trump with fatal effect. In that case the 5-0 trump split would have been a positive advantage for North.

 Phantasy? Phooey 
 To the Editor: 
 Re "Some Questions Unsolved by a Man With All the Answers" by Allan Kozinn [June 2]: 
 I was one of the students who attended Leonard Bernstein's Norton Lectures at Harvard in late 1973, having grown up watching the Young People's Concerts on television. I was also a violin student. At a January 1973 chamber music concert that Mr. Bernstein attended, I had performed the Schoenberg Phantasy. (The concert also included a performance of the Schubert Piano Trio in B flat with a 17-year-old freshman named Yo-Yo Ma on the cello). 
 Afterward, Mr. Bernstein complimented my playing, then added, "But every time I hear Schoenberg, I just want to run to the nearest window and jump out!" Little did I know that those words would more or less serve as the conclusion to his Norton Lectures.

 To the Editor: 
 Re "Eminem III: Now He's a Franchise" by Jon Pareles [June 2]: 
 Eminem's latest album, "The Eminem Show," is not, as Mr. Pareles writes, the emergence of another tired franchise. It is a rap album. What Mr. Pareles calls a shtick is actually an introspection and wonder that have rarely been seen in the genre. 
 Though his interests may appear to be strictly commercial, no one has done more than Eminem to turn a once-stifled art form into something fresh, alive and limitless. It is Mr. Pareles's article that is a commodity: Eminem as a Sunday afterthought, digestible and unthreatening. MICHAEL CLARK

 Re "A Handsome Hunk of a Glass Tower" by Herbert Muschamp [June 2]: 
 Mr. Muschamp is certainly entitled to his opinions about buildings, but his article leaves out some basic economic and social realities. He writes that "a dumb glass box is preferable to a dumb masonry box." But glass curtainwalls cost much more per square foot than brick masonry facades. Not surprisingly, Donald Trump's new glass building is affordable only for the extremely wealthy. Mr. Muschamp might as well write "a building for the elite is preferable to anything more affordable."

 Re "Play That Old Piece if You Must, but Not for Old Time's Sake" by Paul Griffiths [June 2]: 
 Mr. Griffiths is correct to call attention to classical music programming that seems to have little musical or intellectual coherence, specifically the current overexposure of Shostakovich's Fifth Symphony. However, he does not mention the San Francisco Symphony, which later this month will present the work in a refreshing juxtaposition with two other Shostakovich compositions, the Two Pieces (Op. 11) and "From Jewish Folk Poetry." 
 San Francisco has also distinguished itself recently in its coordinated Messaien programming. In preparation for its North American premiere of Messiaen's "St. François d'Assise," the San Francisco Opera encouraged its patrons to attend the Symphony's recent presentation of his "Turangalila Symphony" and is cooperating throughout the summer with various arts groups in the city to present more of Messiaen's music. This is an exciting trend, indicating not only that music appreciation can be enhanced by intelligent structuring but that modern music is important enough to engage an entire community.

 A Sense of Event 
 To the Editor: 
 Paul Griffiths does not mention that Esa-Pekka Salonen and the Los Angeles Philharmonic's performances of Shostakovich's Symphony No. 5 next season are part of a five-year cycle of his complete symphonies and string quartets. The cycle culminates in 2005-6, the year of Shostakovich's centennial. 
 While an orchestra's individual programs may not always provide a dramaturgical journey, the program including the Fifth Symphony is scheduled directly after programs featuring the Fourth Symphony, highlighting the change in Shostakovich's political, musical and stylistic outlook. Next season, our audiences can also hear a concert featuring the String Quartets Nos. 4, 5 and 6, attend panel discussions about censorship and lectures about controversies in Shostakovich's life and see films relating to him. 
 Many factors go into the programming of a full and varied orchestral season. As Mr. Griffiths suggests, context, connection and a sense of event are among them.

 Corporate Producers 
 To the Editor: 
 Re "As Giants in Suits Descend on Broadway" by Peter Marks [May 19]: 
 The reader of the article might conclude that I believe it is difficult for corporations to establish personal relationships with creative artists, in the style of Robert Whitehead and Arthur Miller or Harold Prince and Stephen Sondheim. 
 I would like to elaborate on my view more fully. I believe that the key to successful producing is collaborative and enduring creative relationships. Companies like Disney have already made amazing strides with gifted artists like Julie Taymor, Robert Falls, Bob Crowley, Elton John and others. 
 Any inference that Disney, Clear Channel or any other corporate producer is organically unable to collaborate fruitfully with writers, composers and directors is incorrect.

 HERBERT RESNICK 
 Marlboro, N.J. 
WHAT'S an immigrant to think?
On Sept. 21, Ahmed Alenany, a Brooklyn cabdriver from Egypt, was stopped by the police for parking illegally. They discovered his visa had expired, and in the post-Sept. 11 sweep for illegal immigrants, he spent seven months in jail. Mr. Alenany was understandably surprised that the government would toss him in jail in a terrorism case, after he had been in the United States without proper papers for several years.
''I never expected I would have been arrested,'' he said the other day, now free from jail but still facing possible removal from the country. ''There's something very funny about immigration.''
Funny indeed. If only he had been standing alongside another immigrant, Luis Mejias, watching in amazement here Wednesday as a contractor who was charged with stiffing Mr. Mejias and three other day laborers out of $8,360 in pay was led away in handcuffs. The New York State attorney general had landed with both feet on the side of the laborers, never mind that they are in this country illegally.
''It is imperative that we -- community and government leaders -- act now,'' said Eliot L. Spitzer, the attorney general, ''to give a voice to and protect the rights of all working men and women.''
Mr. Mejias, who came from El Salvador four years ago, was understandably surprised that the government would help him, a poor immigrant on Long Island who didn't even have proper papers. ''It's a tremendous feeling inside of me that the laws in North America would support me,'' he said.
Once merely confused, the government's position on illegal immigrants is now suffering from multiple personality disorder.
For many years, the government winked as immigrants, many here illegally, pruned, painted and chauffeured America. As Mr. Spitzer noted, ''we pass immigration laws, but then Congress doesn't fund enforcement because there's a need for labor.''
With no usual suspects to round up after Sept. 11, law enforcement agents rounded up people they thought might resemble usual suspects. Detaining droves of Middle Eastern men was a simplistic, if understandable, reaction to the terror threat. Consider that the most significant recent arrest in this country was of the accused dirty bomb plotter formerly known as Jose Padilla, born in Brooklyn and raised in Chicago.
The same day that Mr. Spitzer backed the day laborers, an appellate court in New Jersey backed the government's argument that releasing the names of immigrants arrested after Sept. 11 and still being detained could jeopardize the war on terror. The detainees, mainly Muslims from the Middle East, are accused of immigration violations.
Selective enforcement? That's not a charge law enforcement officials readily plead to. But it is hard to deny the obvious.
''To a certain extent,'' Mr. Spitzer said, ''that's what we're seeing.''
THE months since Sept. 11 have underscored the basic contract that the United States has with the illegal work force it maintains. We needed cheap workers. They need work. We reserve the right to cancel the contract without notice.
The laborers' case, Mr. Spitzer said, is ''simple contract enforcement.'' The men, who do everything from digging foundations to landscaping, were hired by Richard Holowchak for about $100 a day. But he stopped paying them, the men said, and a local pastor, the Rev. Allan Ramirez, alerted Mr. Spitzer's office. Their status was never an issue. ''In the labor context, we do not inquire of people's immigration status,'' Mr. Spitzer said.
The experience affirmed the laborers' view of Americans as grateful for gardeners. ''I think they admire us, that we're willing to work so hard,'' said Julio Valle. Mr. Mejias even adorns his room with a picture of an American symbol: the World Trade Center.
''It's so beautiful,'' he said through a translator. ''It's such a shame what happened.''
As chance would have it, Mr. Alenany, the Egyptian driver, also had a picture of the trade center displayed prominently inside the cab he drove. He had added a black strip to signify mourning. But when the police stopped him, the picture of the target of terrorism drew suspicious questions from the officers, Mr. Alenany said.
Mr. Alenany, an amateur photographer, said the subject of his picture was 26 Federal Plaza. The towers just happened to be in the background. He snapped the picture because the federal building, which houses the immigration service, has a special place in his heart.
''I had to go there so many times,'' he said, ''seeking permanent status.''
In near-unanimous votes, both houses of the Legislature overrode Gov. Frank L. O'Bannon's veto of cost-of-living increases for the pensions of teachers and public employees. The measure is expected to cost $3 million next year and $6 million in 2004.
CALLING Donald Trump proud of his new golf course is like saying Tiger Woods has a nice little golf game. And it is as much an understatement to say that Mr. Trump enjoys showing off the layout, the Trump National Golf Club, in Briarcliff Manor.
The other day, Mr. Trump stood on the practice tee at Trump National, smacking out six-irons alongside his supermodel girlfriend, Melanie Knauss, who seems to have made a seamless transition from runway to fairway. Mr. Trump left her to practice and traded in his regular golf cart for a speedier one better suited to his rapid-fire style.
The first nine holes opened on April 15, but Mr. Trump unveiled the back nine yesterday. He said that he spent $40 million to build Trump National, designed by the golf course architect Jim Fazio, who also created Trump International in West Palm Beach.
The Florida layout is now a highly rated course, and Mr. Trump predicts that the Briarcliff layout will be likewise heralded. He said it would surpass even the prestigious Winged Foot Golf Course in Mamaroneck, the site of several United States Open championships, and the Westchester Country Club in Rye, home of the Buick Open.
It so happens that Mr. Trump is a member at Winged Foot, and he takes a mischievous pleasure in now declaring it ''the second-best course in Westchester.''
''This will be the best course in New York,'' he said, adding that it would be sought after for Professional Golfers Association events, and could even surpass Bethpage State Park on Long Island, where the United States Open was held this month.
''The P.G.A. is in love with it, and it's going to be named Best New Course by all the golf magazines,'' he predicted with his usual pessimism. ''It blows Bethpage away.''
The Metropolitan Golf Association, in Elmsford, which establishes the difficulty ratings for golf courses in the New York area, assessed Trump National as a very difficult layout.
''It will take its place immediately as one of the great championship golf courses in Westchester,'' said Jay Mottola, the group's executive director. ''Could it be more difficult than Winged Foot? Only time will tell. But it will definitely earn a place in the upper echelon of the world's best courses.''
If the raves are half what Mr. Trump predicts, Trump National will set the golf world abuzz. And there is no denying that it is amazing. The par-72 course plays extremely long, 7,244 yards from the back tees, and most of the layout flows naturally over the contours of the hilly terrain. Fairways and greens are nestled around hills and into swales, fitting into the lay of the land the way the great old golf courses do. Large, scalloped bunkers of fine, white sand are meticulously manicured.
The huge greens were patterned on those of Augusta National Golf Club. There are huge Trump-made lakes and natural-looking brooks on many holes. And there are broad vistas, including one on the 14th tee, where one can see for miles across northern Westchester. The designers were able to preserve most of the majestic old maples that preside over the course.
The steps up to the tee boxes are made of large blocks of granite, and along the course there are hefty stone walls meticulously crafted of large granite boulders quarried from the property. Clearly, $40 million buys a heck of a golf course. Mr. Trump stares down the first hole like a proud father.
''How would you like to see the single most expensive hole in the United States?'' he asked.
That would be the elaborate 13th hole, a masterpiece from tee to green to waterfall. Yes, a 101-foot-high cliff of black granite, which presides over the 13th green. Mr. Trump is a showman at heart, and he clearly considers the waterfall Trump National's centerpiece. It is pure, over-the-top casino spectacular, and one half expects to see a bank of slot machines emerge at any moment.
''There's never been a waterfall like this on a golf course,'' he said, posing for a photograph in front of it. ''We pump 5,000 gallons a minute.''
It seems like you can hear each one. The watery whoosh precludes greenside conversation. But it sure looks swell.
''When I do something,'' he said, beaming, ''I do it right.''
Mr. Trump is famous for fighting fiercely for his high-profile projects in Manhattan and Atlantic City, but he maintained that Westchester is ''the toughest place to build on the planet'' because of its exhaustive permit processes. This is his first construction project here, though, he often points out that he is the largest private land owner in Westchester in acres.
Until recently, Mr. Trump was proceeding on four different local golf course projects. He dropped two of them in February, claiming that he was frustrated by delays in getting local approvals. He is still trying to get permits for a golf course planned on Seven Springs, a 215-acre estate on the borders of Bedford, North Castle and New Castle.
He bought the Briarcliff Manor site, the Briar Hall Golf and Country Club, for $8 million in a foreclosure in 1997 and bulldozed it in 1999. He has delayed the $75 million residential component, the 71 condominiums and 16 town houses that constitute the financial heart of the Trump National project. Insiders speculate that he is waiting for a stronger market, but Mr. Trump simply says that he wants to perfect the golf course.
A shrewd businessman who knows how to separate his words from his wallet, Mr. Trump insists, ''I'm not in this project for the money.''
''It's not like I'm building a 70-story building. My main goal was to build a great golf course. Now, they'll be more valuable as the Mansions on Trump National.''
Mr. Trump said that he has signed up more than 200 members, and that because of demand, he has doubled the initiation fee. Now it is $300,000. All this, with the clubhouse still a four-foot model inside a plastic box. Members now gather around the outdoor grill next to a modest portable trailer.
Though he is better known for his creations in concrete and steel (with his name in marble and gold), Mr. Trump said that golf courses indulge his artistic side.
''There's nothing more creative than shaping earth,'' he said. ''We've moved three million yards of dirt, the largest excavation project ever in Westchester County.''
Mr. Trump is not shy about his ''anything is possible'' operating style, which falls somewhere between Julius Caesar and Robert Moses.
''I nod, and it is done,'' he said, zooming over one of the two 200-foot-long suspension bridges spanning a deep gully. (''I don't even want to tell you what they cost,'' he said)
Waiting for some sprinkler spray to pass, the developer stopped next to a group of Hispanic workers digging a drainage ditch in the searing heat.
''How ya doin' fellas,'' he said. They stopped toiling and squinted in the hot sun at the blond man in the golf cart. Mr. Trump zoomed on and digressed about how tough a life of manual labor is.
Then he pulled up to a group of smiling club members and made them laugh by saying loudly: ''Ignore these guys. They're just the biggest bankers in New York.''
He stopped at the second tee and took out his Big Bertha driver and smashed a Titleist out about 250 yards, cackling as it rolled down his fairway. All the riches in the world cannot buy a good golf game, but somehow, The Donald has obtained one. He slammed his driver back into his golf bag and laughed, saying, ''These guys think all I can do is build.''
In many ways, Marcus Printup is one of our better jazz musicians: he is an excellent trumpet player among a very small pool of excellent trumpet players, and through his work with the Lincoln Center Jazz Orchestra he has been privy to a large and exclusive body of knowledge about the inner workings of American traditional jazz.
But there's still a complicated passage between good playing and good bandleading. At the Jazz Standard on Tuesday, starting off a week of performances by different trumpeter-bandleaders, his sextet was full of bravado but uncohesive; the performance suffered a fatal mixture of the informal and the constricted.
An opening piece, ''The Inception,'' rested on an affable funk beat. All the front-line musicians (Mr. Printup, the saxophonist Walter Blanding Jr. and the trombonist Wycliffe Gordon) took thorough solos.
They're all talented, and Mr. Gordon in particular abruptly bumped up the level of play, from his first cantankerous phrases. It wasn't bad. But it wasn't great. It was also nearly 30 minutes long.
Mr. Printup proved himself on ''The Bullet Train'' (from his new album on Nagel-Heyer, ''The New Boogaloo''), playing strong, forthright lines with pretty bent notes; you can hear Wynton Marsalis and Booker Little in his sound. But such casual music -- a funk tune, a bebop blues, a soul ballad -- depends on rhythm sections, and this one wasn't breathing very well.
Eric Lewis is an aggressive pianist, and his brutal attack didn't abate.
The drummer, Donald Edwards, carried out backbeats like a forced march. The bassist, Vicente Archer, was basically buried.
One can imagine this music going over better in an environment other than an upscale Manhattan jazz club: outdoors at night, or at a bar with a more communal environment. Maybe. But when jazz musicians approach the backbeats of popular culture as simple fun, there can be an underestimation problem, not only of the audience but also of the backbeats.
In the sunshine its skin is a soft reddish brown. When it rains, it seems to turn a pale orange. Its name is Yaza Gaha Thiri Pissaya Gaza Yaza, which means ''Glorious Elephant King.''
Flapping its ears and tail, breathing what seems an enormous sigh through its trunk, the elephant king paces in its gold-fringed pavilion -- two steps forward, two steps back -- at the end of its rattling chain.
Late last year, the 8-year-old bull was discovered in the far jungles of Rakhine State. Under expert examination it was determined to be that most auspicious of beasts: the one called the white elephant.
Soon it was joined in the pavilion by a second, smaller elephant whose pale gray skin carries undertones of violet. Two white elephants at once, a sign of truly blessed times.
Back as far as history is written, white elephants have been objects of reverence and envy in the nations that are now Myanmar, Thailand, Laos and Cambodia. They have brought glory to the kings who possessed them and, like Helen, have been the objects of dreadful wars, launching not ships, but battalions of lesser elephants.
Monarchs added the possession of a sacred elephant to their titles. Here in the former Burma, a lucky king could call himself Sin Byu Shin, meaning ''Owner of a White Elephant.'' Or simply, for short, Tazi Shin -- ''Owner of One.''
The world has changed. But reverence for white elephants has not disappeared in Southeast Asia.
In Laos, which calls itself the Land of a Million Elephants, the Communist government prided itself on its one white treasure until its recent death. In Thailandthere are 11, all possessions of King Bhumibol Adulyadeh.
Thailand, which is by far the wealthiest of the neighbors today and also the most modern, has announced that it plans to clone the remains of a magnificent white elephant that belonged to King Rama III, who ruled from 1824 to 1851.
Now white elephants have graced Burma, a land where superstition still reigns and where the beleaguered military junta is in need of all the lucky elephants it can get.
The government-controlled press was ecstatic, though dignified.
''According to records, white elephants have emerged during times when kings and governments ruled the nation in accord with the 10 kingly virtues,'' the English-language daily New Light of Myanmar told its readers when the first elephant was found.
''Emergence of the white elephant is a good omen at this time when the state is endeavoring to build a peaceful, modern and developed nation,'' it said. ''It is assumed that the nation will be peaceful, prosper and be totally free from all the dangers because of the white elephant.''
Lt. Gen. Khin Nyunt, one of the three most powerful men in the junta, anointed it with sacred water containing elements of gold, silver and nine precious stones.
Crowds began to gather at its open-sided pavilion here on the outskirts of the capital, where an artificial waterfall has been built to soothe it and armed soldiers keep it from harm.
''It's a strange thing to see,'' said U Kyaw Soe, 39, a trader who has visited several times. ''I like to see how it changes color when they throw water on it.''
Like other visitors, he is a believer. ''I look at it and in my mind I make a wish,'' he said.
Yi Yi Myint, 38, a teacher in an elementary school, was here with her elderly mother and small nephew, who squatted side by side, chins in hand, staring at the two pacing beasts.
She said she tells her students that ''good luck will be coming, not yet, but coming soon.''
Few people, though, understand the unique traits that identify white elephants. A body of arcane literature has accumulated over the centuries that only a learned few can master.
To begin with, white elephants are not quite white, and certainly not albino, according to Richard C. Lair, an American expert on elephants who is based in Thailand. They are rare, light-toned animals that must display a complex set of characteristics to be deemed white.
''The subtleties of the Thai white elephants are still a secret,'' Mr. Lair said. ''When an expert from the palace comes to examine an elephant, it takes them weeks to make a determination.''
Indeed, there are those who whisper that Myanmar may not have sufficient expertise to determine a true white elephant. They wonder secretly whether these beasts might in fact be lumbering mistakes, closer to what people in the West would call white elephants.
The examination begins with the seven basic requirements. The elephant must have white skin -- or light like a new white earthen pot -- and white eyes, white upper palate, white nails, white fur, white tail hair and a white scrotum.
In Thai chronicles, which encompass elephants around the region, the white elephant enjoys a noble status equal to that of royal children, addressed with the same deference and serenaded with the same music.
It is one of the ''seven jewels'' that confer stature and legitimacy on a monarch. In order, they are the precious weapon, the precious elephant, the precious horse, the precious gemstone, the precious lady, the precious finance minister and the precious general of the army.
For the Burmese junta, the discovery of Yaza Gaha Thiri Pissaya Gaza Yaza may have completed the set.
Asprey, the venerable London-based seller of luxury goods, is planning to triple the space it occupies in Trump Tower, reflecting the broadening of its product line under its new management.
The store will expand horizontally, into space on Fifth Avenue just north of the shop's current entrance near 56th Street being vacated by Ferragamo, and vertically into vacant retail space on the second and third floors. The expansion will give it a total of 27,000 square feet, including a small space in the basement that is used for storage.
Although the interior design, by the British architect Sir Norman Foster, has not yet been completed, it is expected that ''a grand staircase'' will be installed to draw customers to the upper floors, said John D. Andrew, a director of Gardiner & Theobald, the construction management firm that is supervising the project.
The store expansion comes at a time of upheaval for Asprey, which traces its roots to 1781. The company -- then Asprey & Garrard -- was purchased in 2000 by investors who also own Tommy Hilfiger. About a year later it was announced that the two brands would split, with Garrard -- jeweler to the British royal family since Queen Victoria -- to concentrate on jewels and develop more stylish products.
Asprey is due to add clothing, shoes, accessories and housewares to its traditional lines of jewelry, silverware, leather goods, guns and books.
Not having a final design and not knowing what mix of clothing, shoes and hard goods will be stocked is complicating project planning, said Mr. Andrew, whose company has supervised store renovations for brands like Gucci, Louis Vuitton, Burberry and Yves St. Laurent.
''If you do a store for Gucci or Louis Vuitton, they know how many suits and shoes and so forth will be in there,'' he said. ''Here we are designing the space as the product line develops.''
With the merchandising approach of the stores changing, Asprey's managers decided they could not close while the expansion proceeds. So, Mr. Andrew said, a careful timetable has been prepared to keep operating in part of the current space, while the alterations, which include a new facade on Fifth Avenue and 56th Street, are constructed.
A lot of effort, he said, will go into shielding customers from the work, so they are not reminded that they are in the middle of a construction site as they shop for pricey products like alligator suitcases.
Plans call for building the temporary store as soon as the 2002 holiday shopping season is over. He said the temporary store will be in the back of the current 9,000-square-foot space, with an entrance from 56th Street or via a corridor leading from Fifth Avenue.
''If we do come in from Fifth Avenue, it will be with highly finished walls,'' Mr. Andrew said. ''You have to maintain the image.''
Construction of the Fifth Avenue portion of the first floor and the upper floors is expected to take less than a year, with the expanded store scheduled to be ready for the year-end shopping season of 2003. Integrating the temporary store into the expanded space will be a matter of a few months after the new one opens, Mr. Andrew said.
The store will be shaped like an inverted pyramid, with the third- floor space the largest and tapering down to the small basement. The design will be patterned after the home store in London, which is currently being refurbished.
Asprey has had a presence in New York since February 1983, always in Trump Tower. The company opened its first location from its home on New Bond Street in London on the second level of the six-story atrium within the 68-story retail, commercial and residential building that occupies the block between 56th and 57th Streets.
A little over two years later, in May 1985, Asprey arranged to establish itself directly on Fifth Avenue by buying out the lease of Loewe, a leather goods store then in the space. Then, as now, the company ensured continuity of operations by keeping the atrium space open while the street-level store was constructed.
Asprey is owned by Sportswear Holding Ltd., whose principal owners are Silas Chou and Lawrence Stroll, the co-chairmen of the Tommy Hilfiger Corporation. Recently Edgar Bronfman Jr., whose family formerly owned the Seagram Company, acquired 40 percent of Asprey's parent company.
In splitting the Asprey and Garrard brands, managers of the company said they planned to capitalize on the well-known names by establishing new stores around the world. They said they planned to open as many as 20 new Asprey and 10 new Garrard stores in the next few years.
Jimmy Maxwell, who played trumpet with many of the best-known big bands in jazz and was also a mainstay of the radio and television studios, died on Saturday at his home in Great Neck, N.Y. He was 85.
As a lead trumpeter in the bands of Benny Goodman, Count Basie, Woody Herman and others, Mr. Maxwell was not usually a soloist, but shaped the sound of the trumpet section and handled the high-note parts; aficionados considered him one of the best in that demanding job.
He stepped into the spotlight on rare occasions, notably on Goodman's hit recording of ''Why Don't You Do Right?'' in 1942, on which he played obbligatos to Peggy Lee's vocals, and on the soundtrack of ''The Godfather'' in 1972, when he was the featured trumpet soloist.
Mr. Maxwell had another, less high profile accomplishment: as he revealed in an interview for an article in The New York Times in 1997, he had more than three decades of success as a methadone user. He recounted how a heroin addiction, acquired in 1962 after falling ill on the Goodman band's famously stressful trip to Russia, had left him broke and despondent. The methadone treatment he began three years later enabled him to overcome his addiction and continue a successful career.
James Kendrick Maxwell was born on Jan. 9, 1917, in Stockton, Calif., and joined a local band led by the pianist and arranger Gil Evans while still in high school. He later worked with Jimmy Dorsey, Maxine Sullivan and, from 1939 to 1943, with Goodman. In 1943 he joined the CBS studio orchestra. He later worked with Perry Como on both radio and television, with the NBC Symphony Orchestra, and in the ''Tonight'' show band.
Mr. Maxwell worked briefly with Duke Ellington in 1961 and rejoined Goodman for the Soviet tour. In the 1970's he worked again with the Ellington orchestra and with the National Jazz Ensemble and the New York Jazz Repertory Company, two of the earliest jazz repertory orchestras.
Mr. Maxwell stopped performing several years ago because of health problems, but practiced and gave trumpet lessons until about a year ago, his daughter, Anne Maxwell Megibow, said. In addition to Ms. Megibow, of Charlottesville, Va., he is survived by a son, David, of Des Moines, and four grandsons.
Mr. Maxwell had a second instrument in his arsenal: the bagpipes, which he played for many years in New York City's St. Patrick's Day parade as well as in the occasional studio session.
To the Editor:
Michele Kayal (''The Societal Costs of Surveillance,'' Op-Ed, July 26) paints a frightening picture of what happens in a society when security becomes more important than liberty. Unfortunately, this seems to be the direction in which the Bush administration is leading the American public.
Using the terrorist threat as a scare tactic, the administration has taken one step after another to erode our fundamental freedoms while simultaneously asking us to pledge allegiance to the flag and to the Republic for which it stands.
The administration consistently reminds us that we must take these steps to protect our lives. Perhaps it needs to be reminded that when our founding fathers signed the Declaration of Independence, they pledged ''our lives, our fortunes and our sacred honor'' to protect the fundamental freedoms they held so dear and not the other way around.

Merrick, N.Y., July 26, 2002
Monolithic glass towers are his skyline signature. But Donald J. Trump has an entirely different plan for the 73-year-old Hotel Delmonico at Park Avenue and 59th Street.
By the time he gets through turning the elongated wedding cake of a masonry building into a high-priced condominium late next year, it will look like -- well -- the Hotel Delmonico. (Except, of course, for its new nameplate: Trump Park Avenue. You were expecting . . . ?)
''Nobody ever saw how beautiful this building is,'' Mr. Trump said last week as he stood on Park Avenue watching cleaning crews on scaffolds erase decades of grime to reveal a mottled, cappuccino-colored brick facade with elegant ivory-toned terra-cotta trimmings. ''And now it's coming out.''
The Delmonico was known to the Concorde set as the home of Regine's discothèque -- ''Order a drink and be prepared to close out your bank account,'' a 1982 guidebook advised -- and to Prohibition agents a half-century earlier as the home of the Breakfast Club on the 30th through 32nd floors, which they padlocked for serving something stronger than orange juice.
In the future, it may be home to a cafe-style restaurant run by the Maccioni family, proprietors of Le Cirque 2000 and Osteria del Circo. Mario Wainer, the maître d'hôtel at Le Cirque, once played the same role at Regine's.
This is the third transformation of the Delmonico, which opened a month before the great crash of 1929 and remained a hotel until 1975, when William Zeckendorf Jr. turned it into a rental apartment building. He sold it in 1981 to Sarah Korein, who turned it back into a hotel a decade later.
Even during its earlier days as a transient hotel, Ed Sullivan lived at the Delmonico in an apartment that The New York Times Magazine described in 1967 as having ''six rooms, four baths, a Renoir, a rarely used kitchen (he hates home cooking, so his wife has never learned) and an office-study lined with books (from Hedy Lamarr's 'Ecstasy and Me' to a biography of Tito).''
Mr. Zeckendorf, too, had an apartment there until recently, on the 31st floor. When Mr. Trump bought the Delmonico last November for $115 million, he told Mr. Zeckendorf he needed the apartment in order to begin renovations.
''We made a deal,'' Mr. Zeckendorf said by telephone last week from his home in Santa Fe, N.M. ''It didn't take us very long.''
The 31st and 32nd floors will be combined to create a duplex that may sell for $25 million to $30 million. On a visit last week, Mr. Trump decided that the top floor, a 17-foot-high aerie with vaulted ceilings and arched windows, ought to be the living room, even though this would reverse the customary arrangement of bedrooms above, living room below. ''How do you give this up?'' he asked the associates, managers and designers around him, including his son Donald Jr. ''The staircase has to be wide and sweeping. It has to sweep into the living room.''
''Hey, Joe, they shouldn't take any more of this ceiling down,'' he told Joseph M. Kaminski, who was general manager of the Delmonico and now manages Trump Park Avenue. ''Replaster the ceiling but leave the exact same shape, because you could never do a shape like this today.''
Preservationists might be amused at the paradox.
Mr. Trump made his mark in the 70's by recladding the Commodore Hotel next to Grand Central Terminal in a slinky new skin of reflective glass. Then he razed Bonwit Teller on Fifth Avenue and battled the tenants of 100 Central Park South, which he wanted to tear down. More recently, he left the exteriors of 40 Wall Street and 610 Park Avenue intact.
At the Delmonico, designed by Goldner & Goldner, Mr. Trump so likes the details, starting with the coffered lobby ceiling, that even he cannot think of many ways to improve what he calls the ''bones of the building.'' But except for a dozen or so occupied apartments, the residential floors are being stripped to structural steel and rebuilt at a cost of about $85 million.
Costas Kondylis, the architect of the new Trump World Tower on First Avenue and the Delmonico renovation, said the Park Avenue building had an advantage over properties that boast of being prewarlike.
''This is not prewarlike,'' Mr. Kondylis said. ''This is prewar.''
What are now 515 rooms will become 140 apartments. On the building's many setbacks, some terraces will be enclosed in glass and turned into greenhouses, adding about 12,000 square feet of floor area to the building.
The corner retail space once occupied by Christie's may be leased to the Maccionis. The Scully & Scully furnishing store will remain on a long lease in the ground-floor space once occupied by Regine's.
Mr. Trump has sought to evict 3 of the 17 remaining tenants, two on the grounds that the Delmonico is not their primary residence. One has already moved out, Mr. Kaminski said, and the second case should be settled soon. He would not discuss the third case, which is pending.
Rent-stabilized tenants have been told that they may remain or negotiate a buyout. However, neither Howard K. Elliot, an interior decorator, nor Lola, his Chihuahua, plan to go anywhere. ''I have happily resided here for 27 years,'' he said, ''and I expect to reside here happily for another 27 years.''
Mr. Elliot recalled the Delmonico of the 70's with relish. ''It had the chicest, most attractive group,'' he said. ''A lot of socialites. It was a pleasure to get in the elevator and see such attractive people.''
Downstairs was the disco that Regine Zylberberg, queen of the French nightclub scene, opened in 1976. ''It was the epitome of glamour and excitement,'' Mr. Elliot said. ''No blue jeans and sweatshirts. The men were beautifully turned out, and the women were in jewels and furs. The music was sensational, and the food was good.
''When that went,'' he said, ''so went the rest of the world.''
Though he considers himself a demanding critic, Mr. Elliot said he had been pleasantly surprised so far by the Trump Organization's stewardship.
''You can't expect to go through gutting a 32-story building without problems,'' Mr. Elliot said. ''But the staff has been very cooperative. If something goes wrong, they send someone quickly to correct it. I have nothing but nice things to say about Mr. Trump. The location is the best available in New York, and he's going to do super, super, zillion-dollar apartments.''
Across town, apartments at 1 Central Park, the twin-tower condominium being constructed atop the AOL Time Warner Center at Columbus Circle, are selling for $1,500 to $3,500 a square foot. Yet as the stock market lurches and the anniversary of Sept. 11 approaches, it might be difficult to imagine even more buyers willing to pay $3,000 to $5,000 a square foot for a home at the Delmonico.
Mr. Trump professes to be unfazed.
''We just had the worst attack in the history of the country, and the condominium market is stronger than it's ever been,'' he said. ''People would rather invest in real estate than in Enron and WorldCom. You can touch it, feel it, smell it. As opposed to Enron, which you can only smell.''
BILL MORIARITY was never ambitious. All he ever wanted, he says, was to play trumpet; if he had a job he was inclined to stay there until it ended.
But pensions make slaves of us all, so at age 50, 14 years ago, Mr. Moriarity became an officer of Local 802, of the American Federation of Musicians. Now he's the president. A union officer can't play professionally, but Mr. Moriarity practices every day anyway, bringing his horn in from his apartment in Kew Gardens Hills so as not to disturb the neighbors. He also keeps, in union headquarters off unbeautiful Eighth Avenue at 48th Street, a beat-up King Super-10, the first trumpet he ever owned.
It takes a little nudging to get him to play -- at first, he'll bring out the horn without the mouthpiece, claiming it is lost. But eventually, in the office dominated by posters of jazz greats, he'll agree.
Genre is not a problem. Mr. Moriarity, a low-key guy whose maroon loafers are buffed to a dance-band shine, has played in jazz clubs and the Broadway pit. As a young man in his hometown, St. Louis, there was a year he taught music at a Catholic boy's school, subbed at the St. Louis Symphony and played at the Grand Burlesque.
Play something from the burlesque, he is asked. He does a stanza of ''St. Louis Woman,'' very slow, all smoke and whiskey, so you can almost see the stripper stepping onto the stage.
How was it, playing for the fabled Tempest Storm and Lili St. Cyr?
''It was hard,'' says Mr. Moriarity, not one to glamorize. ''Twenty-nine shows a week. You worked from mid-August and your first day off was Christmas. It paid $146 a week, the best-paid job in St. Louis. The St. Louis Symphony paid $115 the first year, the Chase Hotel $126.''
Local 802 has about 10,000 members. Last month they went out of strike against the Mostly Mozart Festival, causing a cancellation of 20 concerts. Looming, if at a distance, is the contract with the League of American Theaters and Producers Inc., which expires in March. Continuing are the contracts with Off Broadway producers, which are negotiated individually; as well as the work with jazz musicians, who tend to play two-week gigs in nightclubs where there are no pension plans.
Asked what the union will be demanding of Broadway, Mr. Moriarity says, as union presidents will, that it's more a question of what the other side will be trying to take away. He's concerned about moves to reduce staffing. He also frets about the technological threats to live music. If the technology is so good that the audience is not aware the music is not canned, what's wrong with the producers trying to save a few pennies?
''I think people are aware of it,'' Mr. Moriarity says. ''People are aware of it viscerally. Even if they're not aware intellectually, they're aware emotionally. Not to criticize recordings, but the recording is the shadow of the music. It's the difference between lightning and a lightning bug.''
Life story of the musician turned organizer: grew up in St. Louis, son of a glazer and local union president; picked up the trumpet after the kid down up the street started playing; was working dances at the American Legion Hall at 12. He met his wife, Diane, at the St. Louis Institute of Music. The first of their two sons was born when he was working burlesque.
''The doctor told me the labor could go for a long time, so I went to do the 12:30 show,'' Mr. Moriarity says. ''About 1:15, the comic comes out on stage and says, The wife of the trumpet player had just had a baby boy and would the father please stand up? And the entire band stood up, of course. Old burlesque joke.''
Mr. Moriarity and the family came to New York in 1965 with $18, fearless, he says, the way you are when you are young. He played with Lester Lanin, and was the bandleader for the last Latin band at Roseland. His average salary was between $25,000 and $30,000. As the head of the union, he makes $87,000 a year. He's not certain he could work as a musician again, he says. After more than 10 years of not performing, he fears he's lost his edge.
The talk turns back to live performance.
''I saw the Duke Ellington band in 1956, in Chicago, Labor Day,'' Mr. Moriarity says. ''I can remember everything they were playing, the solos, the impact it had on me, all six hours.''
Oh, yeah? Let's see.
''Creole Love Call,'' Mr. Moriarity begins, ''Then, 'Take the A Train,' then Willie Cook did 'Tea For Two,' then Clark Terry did 'Harlem Air Shaft,' then the sax section did a solo, 'Sophisticated Lady.' ''
HE continues, describing the color of Duke Ellington's entrance outfit: purple. Then he changed clothes every set.
''Listening to the recording helps to recreate the impact, but the impact never came from the recording,'' Mr. Moriarity says. ''It was listening to the sound of the instruments playing. To this day, the most thrilling sound for me is the sound of the trumpet played live.''
It sounds like he should be playing, he is told.
''This is a good job,'' he says. ''The musicians have better lives because of the things we've done here.''
But before those words are out of his mouth, unconsciously as you reach for the handle to open the door, he's picked up his old trumpet, and it dangles from his hand.
President Bush was hardly alone in hoping that America would emerge from the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11 a stronger and more cohesive nation. Yet nobody framed the challenge better than he did in his State of the Union address last January. ''In the sacrifice of soldiers, the fierce brotherhood of firefighters, and the bravery and generosity of ordinary citizens,'' he said, ''we have glimpsed what a new culture of responsibility could look like. We want to be a nation that serves goals larger than self. We've been offered a unique opportunity, and we must not let this moment pass.'' In later speeches he pounded on the same theme, urging Americans to forswear the ''culture of selfishness'' and embrace a ''new ethic of responsibility.''
What has Mr. Bush made of that moment of opportunity, which may have passed us by? Sad to say, not much. Most of us had expected the country to be in a different place by now, and the fact that it is not can be attributed largely (though by no means exclusively) to Mr. Bush's failure to leverage the political and moral capital Sept. 11 provided.
Mr. Bush had the words right. His problem was his failure to give them meaning, either because he did not know what had to be done or because what had to be done exceeded his political will. Sept. 11 summoned Americans to think differently about basic problems and to reach out to one another as never before. It was a moment to begin thinking about less wasteful energy policies, to envision new economic and social strategies, to examine programs of national service for the country's young people -- in short, to entertain genuine sacrifices linked to an elevated vision of America's possibilities. Despite lots of oratory, however, no real sacrifice has been demanded, no vision offered.
In his defense, Mr. Bush has been a busy and burdened man, and as the nation's leader, he has pushed us forward on several fronts. He has proposed a new architecture of homeland defense that could do much to rationalize our quarrelsome and porous security agencies. Abroad, he has prosecuted the complicated war on terrorism with patience and resolve. He certainly did not anticipate the explosion of exposés about appalling corporate behavior that has helped make 2002 a peculiarly ''low dishonest'' moment in American history (to borrow W. H. Auden's observation about the 1930's), instead of the year of fresh beginnings we wanted.
Nevertheless, the most glaring missed opportunities are directly linked to the president. For instance, it is hard to imagine a sharper reminder of America's dependence on the volatile regimes of the Middle East for their oil than the events of Sept. 11. Yet instead of charting a new course, one requiring major investments in energy efficiency and the development of alternative energy sources -- the two surest roads to greater energy independence -- Mr. Bush clung stubbornly to the notion that the United States could drill its way to self-sufficiency. Absent presidential leadership, a timid and unimaginative Congress did little better, rejecting modest efforts to tighten fuel economy standards while showering producers of traditional fossil fuels with a staggering array of subsidies and tax breaks.
Likewise, Sept. 11 seemed to have little impact on Mr. Bush's economic thinking. Everyone makes sacrifices in times of war, including leaders. Franklin Roosevelt, for instance, set aside cherished domestic initiatives after Pearl Harbor because he knew the country could not afford them. In a similar fashion, Mr. Bush might have postponed or even rolled back his tax cut and redeployed the money in more meritorious ways, perhaps to underwrite a serious program of foreign assistance to encourage the growth of democratic institutions in countries where poverty and corruption breed terrorists -- and cynicism about an American government that supports tyrannical leaders. It would have asked much of Mr. Bush to ask him to give up a program so central to his thinking and political strategy. Yet in clinging to the tax cuts as if they were holy writ, as the former presidential adviser David Gergen recently observed on the Op-Ed page, the president has sent a clear signal to the public that we can have both war and business as usual.
Finally, Mr. Bush has come up short in the one area where he seemed most determined to succeed: creating from the wreckage of the World Trade Center a new sense of purpose in our national life. Robert Putnam, an authority on American community life and the author of ''Bowling Alone,'' argues that the attacks of Sept. 11 connected Americans in ways they have not been connected since World War II, creating a sense of solidarity that manifested itself in a heightened political consciousness, a surprising burst in trust for the federal government, an increase in racial and religious tolerance, and a rise in public-spiritedness in general. Mr. Bush himself noted the change immediately and marveled at what he called ''the gathering momentum of millions of acts of decency and kindness.''
Unfortunately, though, the vehicle he created to capture this spirit and enlarge upon it -- the U.S.A. Freedom Corps -- seems to have drifted into irrelevance. It was little more than a gussied-up collection of existing programs to begin with, programs like John Kennedy's Peace Corps and Bill Clinton's AmeriCorps, and so far it has reached only a tiny fraction of America's young people. The administration hopes to double the size of the Peace Corps, to 14,000 from 7,000, and expand AmeriCorps to 75,000 from 50,000. Set against the manifest idealism inspired by Sept. 11, this seems a trivial response. Mr. Bush, as a longtime enemy of big government, seems unable to embrace wholeheartedly a challenge that requires making government programs grow.
If surveys by Mr. Putnam and others are any guide, the mood of sacrifice is fading, the window of opportunity for bottling the patriotism generated by Sept. 11 slowly closing. Mr. Bush continues to extol the virtues of voluntary service, and this is admirable. But it is hardly enough to resist the erosion in the level of public engagement as people return to everyday routines.
In retrospect, Mr. Bush would have been better served -- and the civic enthusiasm of the moment would have had a far greater chance of surviving -- if he had called for something truly bold, like a year of mandatory national service for everyone of college age. Of course, that might have kicked up a political storm. But of what use is political capital unless you spend it? Mr. Bush had plenty of capital to spend after Sept. 11. Sadly, on issue after issue, most of that capital is still in the bank, depreciating by the day.
His name is already on glittery casinos in Atlantic City, and Donald Trump will soon add it to something else in New Jersey -- a stalled 18-hole golf course and housing development in the affluent Somerset County township of Bedminster. On Oct. 1 he is to close on the purchase of the incomplete project spread over 520 acres, 435 of them the former estate and farmland of the failed automaker John Z. De Lorean.
Mr. Trump said the price was ''substantially less than the $35 million the seller invested in the project.''
Mr. Trump said he would open the 280-acre course, designed by Tom Fazio, by the summer of 2004. A membership in what is to be called the Trump National Golf Club at Bedminster -- the name echoes that of another Trump property at Briarcliff Manor, in Westchester County -- is to cost $300,000, he said, the same as in Westchester. The 1939 mansion at the Bedminster development will be turned into a clubhouse.
Mr. De Lorean bought the estate in 1981, just as he began manufacturing his sports cars with their winglike doors. It was sold at a bankruptcy auction in January 2000 to the current seller, a group of investors whose largest equity holder is Fairways International of Southport, Conn. This year the group, facing financial difficulties, halted work at the site.
Mr. Trump said he planned to sell the 14 lots along the course to buyers building estate homes.
THE trumpeter Wynton Marsalis, who on Monday night was due at a party downtown, at a dinner Midtown and at a jam session in Harlem, keeps a frenetic schedule befitting a political candidate. But, said Mr. Marsalis, who has three sons by two former girlfriends, he would never be able to run for office.
''As soon as I did, they'd say, 'Wynton, didn't you . . .?' And I'd have to admit that, yes, I did. And then they'd say, 'And didn't you . . .?' And I'd have to say, 'Yes, I did -- and I enjoyed it, too.' ''
Mr. Marsalis lives fast, has a fast tongue and is intent on leaving a good impression, as if he were afraid that if he slowed down, or was less perfect, someone would come along and take it all away. He juggles touring with his 15-member jazz orchestra, performances with his quartet, recording dates, Jazz at Lincoln Center (where he is the artistic director), television appearances and teaching a handful of Juilliard students jazz trumpet. Oh, and he composes.
On Monday night, Mr. Marsalis, just back from New Hampshire with his orchestra and about to leave for a monthlong tour of Japan, had landed in his well-appointed 29th-floor apartment near Lincoln Center to a full house. In the foyer sat Mizz Alice (Alice B. McKay), who was visiting him from his hometown, New Orleans. In the living room were four guests from Oregon; in the foyer was Ashley Schiff, whose mother, Lisa Schiff, is chairman of Jazz at Lincoln Center. And in the walk-in closet was Mr. Marsalis, 40, ironing his tie.
Mr. Marsalis has firm beliefs about fashion, and stronger feelings about ironing. ''You don't iron ties flat,'' he said. ''There's got to be a roll on the edge, just like on the lapel.''
Ms. Schiff entered his sanctum and, using the stern voice she developed working as a publicist, told him he had to speed things up if he was going to stay on schedule. Ms. Schiff and Mr. Marsalis became pals in Buenos Aires five years ago when she was playing polo there and he was performing with his orchestra. She got to know the band by playing basketball with them.
These days, between looking for a job and flying to South Carolina on weekends to play polo, Ms. Schiff devotes herself pro bono to promoting jazz. At times this requires her to keep the often tardy Mr. Marsalis on time, and to prep him, even for a planned encounter with one of his best friends, like the actor Courtney B. Vance. ''BET is going to be following Courtney around tonight,'' she advised, ''and they'd like you to say something, so be nice.''
A Town Car was waiting to whisk Mr. Marsalis and his horn to the Cutting Room on West 24th Street, where friends like Mr. Vance, the newscaster Deborah Roberts and the saxophonist Ornette Coleman were celebrating the CD release of ''All Rise,'' a jazz symphony Mr. Marsalis composed.
Half an hour late, Mr. Marsalis swept into the club greeting people with handshakes, soul clasps, knuckle bumps and hey-heys! while the music from the album played in the background. Mr. Marsalis says ''Let's go play'' the way other people say ''Let's have a drink.''
Dianne Reeves joined him and his quartet on a cramped stage in the back room to perform ''My Sweet Embraceable You'' and other tunes. Duty done, Mr. Marsalis wended his way out of the party and, still carrying his horn case, got into the car to have dinner at Sushi Den; a wagon train of friends followed.
Jazz musicians who tour Japan become sushi connoisseurs. Mr. Marsalis and Hughlyn F. Fierce, the new head of Jazz at Lincoln Center, teased Ms. Schiff for sticking with California roll. ''Try the eel,'' Mr. Fierce urged.
Over raw tuna, the subject of chitterlings came up. ''We've had many debates about chitterlings in the band,'' Mr. Marsalis said. ''I don't like the smell of them. I've never put a chitterling in my mouth.''
''He looks like a chitterling eater,'' Mr. Fierce said, indicating Doug Thornton, a cousin of Ms. Reeves.
Ms. Schiff asked, ''What's a chitterling?''
Mr. Vance explained, ''Well, it's hog intestines.''
Ms. Reeves added, ''And they have it in France. They just call it tripe.''
''I'm not afraid of a chitterling,'' Mr. Marsalis said diplomatically. ''There's nothing wrong with a chitterling.'' After he and the other musicians volleyed a couple of double entendres involving various kinds of rolls, , Mr. Marsalis explained his philosophy of being careful. ''You look over the line,'' he said, ''but you don't step over it.''
Mr. Fierce said, ''But you do look.''
Mr. Marsalis answered, ''There's no harm in looking.''
A slightly reduced group headed to the Sugar Hill Bistro in Harlem, where young men clasping trumpets were waiting. If it's cool to be with the band, it's even cooler to be with the guy who determines who's in the band. Crowds parted when Mr. Marsalis appeared. Inside, Mizz Alice was seated up front.
Warmed up with sake and sushi, Mr. Marsalis uncorked his horn and sailed into a set. Six hours after ironing his tie, he was still as crisp as a banker. Around midnight he said, ''Let's bring on some of these young players here. How about Dizzy Gillespie's 'Wheatleigh Hall'?''
A parade of earnest horn players grabbed the limelight. The last was a young woman who closed her eyes and ripped up the place with a trombone solo. And the Sugar Hill Bistro became, for just a short time after midnight, the center of the jazz universe. (It was no surprise to Mr. Marsalis that the young trombonist was Jennifer Krupa, a granddaughter of the drummer Gene Krupa.)
There was no way to beat that. Like any other party-hardy good-timer, Mr. Marsalis was better at saying goodbye than he was at leaving. A circle of well wishers and jazz students gathered around him to talk. Wess Warmdaddy Anderson, his sax player, commented on one member of the party who left early.
''I can hang,'' he told Ms. Schiff. ''And you can hang. But he can't hang.'' Hang being, after all, a prime requirement for jazz lovers.
Mr. Marsalis is competitive even when it comes to hang, though he also believes sternly in getting up early. ''There's hang,'' he said, ''And then there's the after hang. And that can narrow down to a very small, very select group. It can be a group as small as two. Want to go to the after hang?''
The Atlanta Falcons were cruising in this pressured meeting with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers today, one that would help decide which team belongs atop the National Football Conference South. It was a 3-3 game at halftime and each time the Bucs pushed, the Falcons pushed back. Whenever the Bucs' intensity rose, so did the Falcons'.
But in the third quarter, the Buccaneers knocked quarterback Michael Vick out of the game and showed why they could be the class of this division and by season's end the class of the N.F.C. The Buccaneers forced their will and might on the Falcons in a 20-6 victory at the Georgia Dome before 68,936 fans who eagerly arrived hoping for a surprise but found some of the Falcons' same old unnerving tricks.
Tampa Bay won its fourth straight game and improved to 4-1; Atlanta slipped to 1-3.
There were five plays that summed up the second half, and four of them the Falcons would have loved to have eliminated.
With 13 minutes 8 seconds left in the third quarter, defensive end Simeon Rice slammed Vick hard to the ground, injuring Vick's right (nonthrowing) shoulder. Vick, the N.F.C.'s top-rated passer, was lost for the game with a sprained shoulder, and he could miss Atlanta's next game, at the Giants on Sunday.
With 6:18 left in the third quarter, Jay Feely converted a 32-yard field goal to give Atlanta a 6-3 lead.
Three plays later, Brad Johnson tossed a 76-yard touchdown pass to Keyshawn Johnson -- his first scoring reception of the season -- to lift Tampa Bay to a 10-6 lead.
With 11:25 left in the final quarter, Bucs safety Dexter Jackson thwarted a Falcons fake punt and pass by pulverizing the intended receiver, tight end Brian Kozlowski. The ball flew into the air and cornerback Dwight Smith grabbed it, leading to a field goal.
And finally, with 6:14 left, Rice leveled Falcons quarterback Doug Johnson in the pocket, tackle Warren Sapp caught the ball at the Atlanta 15-yard line and then threw a lateral to linebacker Derrick Brooks. Brooks ran for a touchdown, his third scoring return of the year.
In most instances, they were huge, momentum-swinging plays that the Buccaneers forced.
''You know where I come from -- I like to see a lot of people involved and contributing, and we had that today,'' Tampa Bay Coach Jon Gruden said. ''You build a team where everyone is accountable to each other and keep pounding that rock. Sooner or later, the rock cracks.''
The Tampa Bay defense held Vick to 37 yards passing and 1 yard rushing before he was injured. Johnson, his replacement, was intercepted three times. Atlanta's Warrick Dunn, a former Buc, was held to 14 yards rushing on 9 carries. Eleven times, the Falcons failed to convert on third down, and they averaged only 3.8 yards a play.
''Coach says there should be an investigation because it looks like there is 12 of us out there on defense right now,'' Sapp said. ''They tried to trick us some out there. A lot of times, those kind of tricks blow up in your face.''
They did for the Falcons.
Atlanta opened the game by driving to the Tampa Bay 28, but Feely missed a 46-yard field goal. Atlanta forced a fumble and then Feely converted a 34-yard field goal.
Then the Falcons recovered an onside kick. ''They had a bye last week, and when you give Dan Reeves and his staff that much time, they are going to be tricky,'' Gruden said.
But Atlanta got nothing from that first-quarter trick kick.
When it tried more trickery to start the fourth quarter, Jackson responded. Punter Chris Mohr lobbed a high pass for Kozlowski, but just as the ball met Kozlowski's chest, Jackson delivered a devastating blow.
''The game was a dogfight -- we were ahead, 10-6, at that point -- so anything could still happen,'' Jackson said. ''I have wide responsibility on the punt return team, and as I lined up wide against Travis Jervey, I could tell he wasn't being himself. Usually he's pretty wired and excited, but he was too calm.
''So, when the ball was snapped, I ran with him for a couple of steps and then I just looked behind me. And that's when I saw Kozlowski coming toward me and beginning to flare out like he was looking for a pass. So, I jumped the route and put my head in there. I didn't even see what happened. My teammates just mobbed me afterward and said I just made one of the special plays that we always look for.''
Some teams are built around offense. Or even special teams. The Buccaneers remain a team ingrained with a defensive mentality.
Asked if this was the best defense he had seen this season, Reeves replied: ''They were that before we played them. Sometimes when you put in the week of work that we put in and then you don't get the job done, it hurts. Everybody in that locker room is hurting.''
Plenty of that sting was supplied by the Bucs.
''This is the first time I have ever fallen on my shoulder like that and injured it,'' Vick said. ''I would love to have gone back in there because in a 3-3 game, no matter what has gone on before, all I need is one play to make a difference. Not only do they have a good defense that starts with their strong front four, but they also have the ability to sniff you out. They were in the right place at the right time and they just didn't make any mistakes.''
An expert whose career ended 40 years ago and who came back to visit a modern tournament would be astonished by the variety of events. ''What on earth is an imp pairs?'' would be an inevitable question.
This event has been made possible by computers. All the scores on a deal are averaged, and an imp score is awarded by comparing against that average. The result is a pairs competition in which the contestants can play as if in a team event. Overtricks are of little importance.
At the Summer Nationals in Washington in July, the National Imp Pairs was won by Alan Schwartz of Fairfax, Va., and Aitui Lo of Reston, Va. In another event, Schwartz was in one no-trump on the diagramed deal. Such situations, with the lead changing hands frequently, are often more complex than high-level contracts.
South had little chance to make seven tricks, so his goal, as often happens, was to escape for down one. He tried dummy's 10 when a diamond was led, and East took the ace and shifted to a low spade. South's queen lost to the king, and West would have done best to persevere with diamonds or shift to clubs.
Instead, he gave South some help by shifting to a heart, the seven. He was hoping to knock the heart entry out of the dummy, which represented the potential entry for the 13th spade.
The heart seven was an eccentric choice, and when dummy played low East played the jack. South won with the king, crossed to dummy's ace, noting the appearance of the nine on his left, and tried a spade.
He was disappointed when West took two spade tricks and shifted back to diamonds. The position was this:
South had escaped a club shift, which would have been decisive. He now had a chance to make a sixth trick if he could decipher what was going on in hearts. Since West had kept the six hidden, it appeared that he had begun with Q-9-7.
So the normal play was the five, hoping the queen would appear. But Schwartz did not believe that West would have risked leading from the queen at the third trick.
South, assuming that West's spot plays in hearts were eccentric, therefore led his 10. He was rewarded when this pinned the six, and the five became his sixth trick.
Most world titles have had winners from many countries. One exception is the World Women's Pairs, which has been won seven times by the United States, three times by Britain, and once by the Netherlands. In Montreal in August, Karen McCallum of Exeter, N.H., became the first player to win with two different partners: She was successful with Debbie Rosenberg of New Rochelle, N.Y., at 34 the second-youngest player ever to win the title. McCallum also won in 1990 with Kerri Sanborn of Stony Point, N.Y.
The diagramed deal from the event illustrates how far styles have changed in selecting one no-trump opening bids. Seventy years ago Ely Culbertson and his group had stringent standards and hardly ever made the bid, even if the requirements were met, because their responding methods were unreliable. McCallum and Rosenberg believe in opening one no-trump at the drop of a hat, reasoning that they can usually find the right contract and that this policy makes life difficult for the opponents.
In this case, McCallum as South opened one no-trump with a 5-2-4-2 hand, a choice that few would make. It had the useful effect of silencing the opposition, who could have made at least 11 tricks in a club contract. After North's transfer response, showing spades, three diamonds promised at least a four-card spade fit. Three hearts was a re-transfer, and four spades became the contract. The North-South hands offered two chances: the club king might provide a diamond discard in the dummy, and the diamonds could provide a discard for dummy's singleton club. Both these plans were due to fail against accurate defense.
A trump was led, and South won in her hand and crossed to dummy with a second trump. East discarded a discouraging club and a discouraging diamond, causing South to suspect that the minor-suit honors were badly placed for her. She therefore took an immediate diamond finesse, leaving a harmless trump at large. It was harmful to West, however, because it gave her a losing option. When she won the third trick with the diamond king she thought it was safe to exit with her remaining trump. McCallum showed that this was a misconception by winning and playing the ace-jack of diamonds to discard dummy's singleton club. Then she could claim her game, conceding two heart tricks.
Richard Seader and his fellow residents in the Chatsworth, a landmark building on 72nd Street near Riverside Drive, battled their landlady for decades with the dramatic flair of the musicals and plays Mr. Seader once produced on Broadway.
Now Mr. Seader and the other tenants have joined forces with the current landlord to fight Donald J. Trump over a 36-inch-wide strip of land that separates the Chatsworth's western wall from the site of the next planned tower in the $3 billion Trump Place project, on the Hudson River waterfront.
Both sides claim to own what can best be described as a three-foot demilitarized zone.
The dispute has all the elements of a typical New York real estate brawl, but it also wends its way through the city's industrial past, when railroad barons ruled New York, and the storied history of the Chatsworth, a Beaux-Arts masterpiece where Brenda Vaccaro and Susan Sarandon once lived and Conan O'Brien now occupies the penthouse. Finally, the Chatsworth's fate may have fallen into a Catch-22 in the arcane and contradictory world of zoning and urban planning.
If Mr. Trump has his way, his latest condominium tower at Trump Place will cantilever over the 36-inch strip and block the unobstructed views of the Hudson from the Chatsworth's 350 or so west-facing windows. More important, the tenants say, a portion of the 31-story Trump tower will come as close as three inches from 102 windows of the 12-story Chatsworth, blocking all light and air from 82 rooms and rendering them uninhabitable.
The city does not usually permit windows in a wall built on a property line, but no one imagined when the Chatsworth was completed in 1904 that a residential development would spring up on the once bustling railyard next door.
Mr. Seader and the tenants' association worry that the fire escapes on the western wall, like the one outside his kitchen window, will become dangerously impassable and that construction of Mr. Trump's tower will damage the stability of the Chatsworth, much as a nearby sewer project cracked the foundation in the 1970's. Some of the fire escapes themselves could be knocked out by Mr. Trump's tower. The landlord has filed a lawsuit to block the project. There is also a Web site: TrumpPlaceIsChokingUs.com
''This is an enormously serious problem,'' said Mr. Seader, who has lived in the Chatsworth with his wife, Sylvia, for 41 years. ''The most critical issue is the physical safety of the building.''
Mr. Trump, who successfully fended off lawsuits against his supersized Trump World Tower near the United Nations, is unsympathetic to the tenants' complaints about their loss of views.
''Welcome to New York,'' Mr. Trump said.
''They've had those windows for many years,'' he continued. ''But I got this approved in 1992. They're 10 years too late.''
After years of community opposition and lawsuits, Mr. Trump obtained city approval in 1992 to build what he now calls Trump Place, which will have 16 apartment buildings with 5,700 apartments when finished, a 20-acre public park and an extension of Riverside Drive from 72nd Street to 59th Street. The developer's model clearly showed that the tower at 72nd Street would butt up against the Chatsworth, blocking windows and possibly making some rooms illegal for occupancy.
The tower will be the sixth built in the project and the one regarded as the most valuable, because of its location. Excavation work for the foundation has already begun, and the developer hopes to begin construction by December.
But the owner of the Chatsworth, Lenore Dean, never voiced any opposition, mostly because control of the building had been taken away from her and put into the hands of a receiver in 1987.
Regarded as one of the finest apartment hotels in the city a century ago, the Chatsworth had fallen on hard times. The vast 15-room apartments had been carved into smaller units, the elevators did not work and the terra cotta cherubs that adorned the facade were chipped and broken. For more than 20 years, the tenants' association, which included Ms. Sarandon and Mr. Seader, had to fight for heat, hot water and the most basic repairs.
''It was monstrous what was going on here,'' said Mr. Seader, a tenant leader who produced more than 60 plays and musicals on and off Broadway, including ''Swinging on a Star.''
Mrs. Dean died in 1998 at 93, and ownership of the building passed to her five grandchildren, who have regained control of the property and worked hard to restore the grandeur of the Chatsworth, according to Mr. Seader and another tenant, Henry Saltzman, whose apartment windows on the 10th floor look west onto Mr. Trump's construction site.
But just as a sense of relief and hope settled over the residents of the building, the reality of Mr. Trump's project shocked them. The only windows in a number of apartments will be completely blocked by Mr. Trump's tower. In some spots, the new building will be 3 to 48 inches away, according to the lawsuit. The tower will be so close, Mr. Seader said, that the fire escapes could be turned into dangerous chimneys in the event of a fire.
Assemblyman Scott Stringer said he had asked the city to intervene, but so far, each of the appropriate agencies has said the matter is out of its hands.
''We're looking at the issues,'' said Ilyse Fink, spokeswoman for the Buildings Department. ''But the siting of the building was approved by City Planning.''
Not so fast, said Robyn Stein, Ms. Fink's counterpart in the Department of City Planning.
''It's not under our purview anymore,'' she said. ''We went through the land use process 10 years ago. We approved a facade and an envelope,'' or a space within which a developer can design a building. ''But the design wasn't detailed. They have to go to the Buildings Department.''
So the Chatsworth owners are trying to force Mr. Trump to redesign his tower so it does not encroach on their property. They contend that they own the 36-inch strip of land atop the retaining wall at the edge of the two properties as a result of a 100-year-old deal with Chauncey M. Depew, president of the New York Central and Hudson River Railroad Company.
According to the documents, Mr. Depew wanted to build the retaining wall on the two properties in 1887 so that rocks, earth and debris would not fall on his train tracks. In a subsequent agreement, Mr. Depew gave his neighbor the right to excavate a portion of the retaining wall and erect the western foundation of what became the Chatsworth.
The Chatsworth's current owners contend that Mr. Depew also said that the three-foot strip along the top of the retaining wall and along the west side of the Chatsworth belongs to the building. Even if he did not, the Chatsworth lawyers contend, the Chatsworth has established ownership by maintaining the fence and the locked steel gates at either end of the strip for more than 30 years.
''It's totally without merit,'' Mr. Trump said of the Chatsworth lawsuit.
The Trump project's lawyers claim that the developer owns the top of the retaining wall and can therefore build a tower that will rise up against that wall and then cantilever over the top of it and almost, in some places, brush up against the Chatsworth.
Howard S. Weiss, a lawyer for the Chatsworth owners, said that they had tried to reach a compromise with Mr. Trump this year. But, Mr. Weiss said, when City Planning officials indicated they would consider their alternative proposal from the Chatsworth group, the talks were broken off. He vowed to continue the battle.
''This is not about views,'' Mr. Weiss said. ''We understand that the reality of life in New York is that there's always going to be development and views are going to be lost and gained. This is about light, air and safety.''
On May 1, 1989, Donald J. Trump took out full-page advertisements in four New York newspapers calling for the return of the death penalty. Mr. Trump said he wanted the ''criminals of every age'' who were accused of beating and raping a jogger in Central Park 12 days earlier ''to be afraid.''
Thirteen years later, as new evidence raises the possibility that the five teenagers convicted in the attack had nothing to do with it, their supporters are focusing some of their fiercest anger at Mr. Trump.
''Trump is a chump!'' protesters shouted during a recent demonstration, accusing Mr. Trump of, at least, further inflaming passions and perhaps tainting the defendants' future jurors. Some called him a racist. Supporters of the Central Park defendants have demanded an apology.
One does not appear to be forthcoming.
''No,'' Mr. Trump said yesterday. ''They confessed. Now they say they didn't do it. Who am I supposed to believe?''
The lingering anger over the ad underscores the powerful emotions unleashed by the case 13 years ago, and by its sudden re-emergence at the forefront of public debate. Just as the case came to symbolize the feeling of vulnerability among New Yorkers, especially white New Yorkers, the ad seems to represent, for its detractors, the perceived rush to judgment against five black youths. The text of the ad is misremembered at times, with protesters quoting words like ''animals'' and ''wilding'' that did not actually appear in it.
In 1989, Mr. Trump paused in building his real estate empire to run the 600-word ad in The New York Times, The Daily News, The New York Post and New York Newsday, at a total cost of $85,000, under the boldfaced heading, ''Bring Back the Death Penalty. Bring Back Our Police!''
In the ad, Mr. Trump said Mayor Edward I. Koch had stated ''that hate and rancor should be removed from our hearts,'' to which Mr. Trump replied: ''I do not think so. I want to hate these muggers and murderers. They should be forced to suffer and, when they kill, they should be executed for their crimes.'' At the time, the attack victim was still in a coma.
The ad does not name any defendant, instead referring collectively to ''roving bands of wild criminals.''
The five young men confessed, four of them on videotape, and served prison sentences. But last January, a convicted murderer, Matias Reyes, announced that he alone had raped the jogger and that the teens who had confessed had not been present. DNA tests linked Mr. Reyes to semen on the jogger's sock. Lawyers for the original defendants have called for their exoneration, and a report from the Manhattan district attorney's office on the new evidence is due in court on Dec. 5.
''At the time there seemed to be very little question, but all of a sudden this seems to come up,'' Mr. Trump said. ''I do have tremendous respect for the district attorney, and I'm sure the right answer will come out.''
The confessions mystify him, he said. ''Why did they confess to the crime?''
Michael W. Warren, a lawyer for the men, said there was a growing resentment for Mr. Trump's advertisement.
''It was outrageous,'' Mr. Warren said, ''the manner that Mr. Trump used to engage in his own personal form of rhetoric. A lot of people felt it colored the eyes of prospective jurors who ultimately sat on the case. Now it's even more appalling, with new evidence that points exclusively to another person. I think Donald Trump at the very least owes a real apology to this community and to the young men and their families.''
Carol Taylor, a writer and demonstrator at the recent rallies, was not surprised at Mr. Trump's recent comments. ''Of course he won't apologize, because he's a rich white colorist male who is wallowing in the unearned privilege of his white skin color,'' she said. On Monday, she held a sign that said: ''Donald Trump, don't be a chump. For dissing black boys so bad, where's your full-page apology ad?''
A protest is planned near the Trump Tower on Fifth Avenue in Midtown on Sunday. ''I'll be there. I think I'll make my sign bigger,'' Ms. Taylor said.
Mr. Trump shrugged off the planned protest. ''I don't mind if they picket. I like pickets.''
AT 7 p.m. on Thursday, Donald J. Trump and his lady friend, Melania Knauss, breezed in to inspect the scene at the World Bar, a new lounge on the ground floor of the Trump World Tower apartments across from the United Nations.
''I go downtown a lot, and I own a lot downtown, but this is more me,'' Mr. Trump said as an impeccably well-mannered waitress in a black cocktail dress passed a silver tray of hors d'oeuvres.
The World Bar, which is owned and operated by Mark Grossich, who also owns the Campbell Apartment and the Carnegie Club, is actually more understated than Mr. Trump's trademark style.
Instead of the grand chandeliers and sweeping pink marble foyers, the two-level room, designed by Arthur de Mattos Casas, a Brazilian architect, has brass Giacometti-style cocktail tables and gold-colored upholstered banquettes with matching ottomans.
''It's meant as an adult cocktail lounge,'' Mr. Grossich said, ''not somewhere where all the trendy club kids line up.''
And instead of tipsy socialites who table-dance, Mr. Grossich said he hoped the bar would attract diplomats, neighbors from Beekman Place and Sutton Place and Trump World Tower residents, including Bill Gates, Harrison Ford, Derek Jeter and Sophia Loren, all of whom own or rent apartments there.
The music is kept at conversation-friendly pitch. The waitresses are all as young, pretty and international as 1960's Braniff airline stewardesses; they wear uniform Nicole Miller dresses and come from places like South Africa, South America and Australia.
On Thursday evening, Nancy B. Hamon, 83, a philanthropist from Dallas, sat by the 30-foot windows sipping cocktails with a group of friends before heading to the ''21'' Club for a dinner party.
''The best thing about the bar is the lighting,'' said Ms. Hamon, adding that she also likes to frequent the Nat King Cole bar at the St. Regis.
''A 35-year-old would probably get carded here.''
David Enright, a Broadway producer who lives in the Trump World Tower, turned to Ms. Hamon and said, ''I could pour you a drink upstairs for 10 cents, but I'd rather pay $10 down here. And I have a pretty amazing apartment.''
Two blondes walked past with gift bags from a party and perched themselves on raised banquettes. They scanned the menu for a nightcap.
''There's not that much action here for a Thursday night,'' observed Jasmine Rainier, 30, an actress wearing a leather top and designer heels.
The one object in the room that seemed to be attracting almost as much attention as Mr. Trump himself was a $50 drink called the World's Most Expensive Cocktail.
''That's a great name,'' Mr. Trump remarked. ''But I never touch alcohol.''
Asked Ms. Hamon, ''Champagne and Cognac mixed? The mere thought of it gives me a headache.''
Ms. Knauss, was feeling brave. She picked up a flute and took a sip of the gold-colored liquid.
''Um,'' she said. ''A very special taste.''

This is a new 30-second commercial that H. Carl McCall, the Democratic candidate for governor, began broadcasting statewide yesterday.
PRODUCER -- GMMB
ON THE SCREEN -- Bill Clinton at a rally for Mr. McCall, on a stage crowded with elected officials, including Mr. McCall and Representatives Charles B. Rangel and Nydia M. Velásquez. As Mr. Clinton talks, the commercial shifts to images of Mr. McCall in action as a campaigner (talking to retirees, for example) and as comptroller (scrutinizing computer screens). Some of the images will be familiar to viewers of his previous commercials. Then it's back to Mr. Clinton. At his final words, the stage and the audience break into applause, and these words appear on the screen: ''Carl McCall. Democrat. Governor. Vote Tuesday Nov. 5.''
THE SCRIPT -- Mr. Clinton: I was a governor for 12 years. When the economy is in bad shape, it's more important to have a good governor. Carl McCall knows how to handle money. He saved the taxpayers millions as comptroller. Born poor, raised by a single mother, he learned from life itself the value of hard work, education and opportunity for everybody.
Somebody in power needs to be thinking about you every day, and Carl McCall will think about you every single day.
ACCURACY -- Some of the claims are true, others are subjective.
SCORECARD -- Finally! Mr. McCall plays the trump card when it comes to bringing Democrats home, something he needs to do quickly. The populist -- and, with Democrats, popular -- Mr. Clinton makes the case for Mr. McCall more convincingly than Mr. McCall does for himself, with a reminder that the candidate overcame humble circumstances to amass a wealth of experience, the element of Mr. McCall's story most likely to appeal to blacks, Latinos and liberal whites. This low-budget, feel-good advertisement even gives the impression of a campaign with momentum. SHAILA K. DEWAN
Last winter, Jun Saito, a Yale University teaching assistant in political science, was in New Haven surfing Web sites when an item from home caught his eye. Japan's main opposition party was looking for a sacrificial lamb to run for Parliament in a district known as a ruling party ''kingdom.''
Fast forward to last week: Mr. Saito, 33, was moving into a new office in Parliament, was getting used to snappy salutes from parliamentary guards, and was composing e-mails to his academic advisers, gingerly explaining that his doctoral thesis might be late.
He had the ultimate student excuse for a late paper: he has been sworn into the Parliament of Japan, the second most powerful economy in the world.
''I am taking a leave of absence,'' he said, looking a mite guilty over this opportunity for first-hand political research, as he gave an interview in his new office. ''Getting a Ph.D. is almost impossible if I stay in this line of work.''
Mr. Saito was swept into office Oct. 27 in a special election marked by both apathy about politics and a small turn of the generational wheel. On one hand, record low turnouts marked the seven races, six of which were won by members of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party or their allies. In Mr. Saito's Yamagata Prefecture, a mountainous northern district known for its skiing, only 43 percent of voters turned out, down from 72 in the last vote, in June 2000.
At the same time, four of the new members are in their 30's, contrasting with the Parliament's image as a cautious club of grandfathers. Even with this new blood, the governing party, which controls almost half of the 727 seats, has as many members over age 70 as under age 45.
''In Japanese politics, to be in your 60's is to be a young boy,'' said Kotaru Tamura, 39, who was elected as an independent supported by the governing party, noting that he succeeds a man who died in office at age 84. ''We are the babies.''
Although both men represent rural, rice farming districts, they exemplify an increasingly cosmopolitan aspect of Parliament. Both speak fluent English, honed while they earned master's degrees in the United States. Mr. Tamura's was, coincidentally, also from Yale, in business.
''The voters know I am international,'' Mr. Tamura said in his equally bare bones office. ''They don't care about Yale, U.C.L.A. or University of Nebraska. They just know that I studied in the U.S.''
During the fall campaigns, the new congressmen said, voters were primarily worried about the economy, complaining about lack of new investment and of factories moving to China.
''They see me as a human bridge between their world and the outside world,'' said Mr. Saito, stressing that on the campaign trail he largely spoke to voters in the local dialect. His Web site résumé mentions that he studied in the United States, but it also stresses his farm boy roots: attending primary school in a wooden schoolhouse, and ''riding next to my father on the combine harvester after school.''
''I was raised up seeing the backs of my family members working,'' he continued.
These younger, more traveled members could help break the political paralysis that has left Japan settling for muddle-through policies ever since the economic bubble burst in 1989, according to ''Can Japan Come Back?'' a report issued here on Friday by the Pacific Council on International Policy.
''A gradual infusion of new faces bodes an eventual change in Japan's political culture,'' reads the report by the Los Angeles-based research organization.
The recent election also indicates widespread political alienation. Four of the seven seats up for election, including Mr. Saito's, were vacated by ruling party members forced to resign because of corruption charges. The Liberal Democratic Party, in power almost continuously since 1955, had the support of only 35 percent of 1,886 voters interviewed in late October for the newspaper Yomiuri Shimbun.
''If I were a graduate student in political science and looking for a theme, I would compare the PRI in Mexico,'' the long-governing party there, ''with the L.D.P. in Japan,'' Pete Wilson, the former governor of California, said here Friday, presenting the Pacific Council report. ''Both have had long political monopolies.''
The scope of Mr. Saito's graduate thesis is narrower -- focusing on Japanese electoral politics. But his advisers in New Haven barely conceal their feeling that he jumped the gun, winning office before getting the degree.
''I guess winning the election is prima facie evidence that he is doing something right,'' said Tasos Kalandrakis, an assistant political science professor who is on Mr. Saito's dissertation committee. ''It may be true that academics are not always able to cope in the real world, but Jun strikes me as someone who can.''
Frances Rosenbluth, his thesis adviser, confessed: ''I have to admit I was disappointed when I first learned of Jun's decision to run for office.
''He was my pride and joy,'' she added. ''I was a little disappointed that he would not be the next star in Japanese political science.''
Reminded of these sentiments, Mr. Saito again looked a little sheepish. But then he brightened, remembering that he expects to campaign within two years against Koichi Kato, the governing party congressman who resigned last April over corruption allegations.
''Kato got his master's degree from Harvard, and I got mine from Yale,'' he said. Couching a race for a parliamentary seat in rural Japan in terms of a rivalry usually played on football fields in New England, he added: ''So I will be trying to defeat an evil Harvard graduate.''
In the latest fallout from the bribery scandal among city tax assessors, Donald J. Trump has sued the city for $500 million, saying that the scheme forced him to sell apartments at his First Avenue skyscraper for inordinately low prices.
Citing testimony in the bribery case, he said that corrupt assessors had raised taxes for properties like Trump World Tower, a 72-story building across First Avenue from the United Nations, to cover up their conspiracy to lower taxes for certain landlords. Unfairly high taxes, Mr. Trump said, reduced the value of his condominiums, forcing him to sell the apartments for less than what they were really worth.
Mr. Trump is demanding that the city not only lower the property taxes at Trump World Tower to $7.01 million a year from $11.6 million but also pay him $500 million in damages.
''They set my taxes so high in order to pay for the buildings where the taxes were set low illegally,'' Mr. Trump said. ''I would've gotten much higher prices for my apartments had I been paying real taxes. People don't realize that this is perhaps the greatest bank robbery in the history of America.''
Mr. Trump did manage to sell apartments at Trump World Tower for an average of $1,046 per square foot, or $1.5 million for a cozy two-bedroom, according to the Corcoran Group, a residential brokerage firm. Eighty-one percent of the apartments at Trump World Tower have been sold.
Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg has described the scheme as ''the largest and most financially damaging corruption scheme ever conducted within city government.'' But Mr. Trump's latest move does not endear him to either the city or his fellow real estate tycoons. The suit questions the fairness of the municipal property tax system just as the Bloomberg administration considers a property tax increase of up to 25 percent to plug a budget gap.
Mr. Trump is also turning on his brethren: he says he plans to sue the landlords who benefited from the bribery scheme, a list that includes prominent apartment house owners like Leonard Litwin, Sheldon Solow and the Resnick real estate family.
According to prosecutors, Albert Schussler, a wealthy property owner and real estate consultant, was the ringleader of a group that bribed tax assessors to lower tax bills for his clients in a scheme that cost the city $40 million a year in lost revenues. Fifteen of the 18 current and former assessors indicted by a federal grand jury in Manhattan have pleaded guilty. Mr. Schussler, who is 86, and two other men are set to go on trial in January.
Mr. Litwin, Mr. Solow, Burton P. Resnick and the owners of the 562 Manhattan properties that benefited from the scheme have all said they were not aware of any wrongdoing by Mr. Schussler, who was their friend and consultant. Mr. Schussler was a member of the city's most powerful real estate club, the Real Estate Board of New York, as are the other men; Mr. Trump is not.
''It is impossible for any one of those property owners who used Schussler not to have known what was going on,'' Mr. Trump said. ''I'm getting ready to bring a major lawsuit against all the property owners whose taxes I was funding, because I was honest and used legal channels. The other people used illegal channels and got better results.''
Steven Spinola, president of the Real Estate Board, took exception. ''These charges are outrageous and unfounded,'' he said. ''The individuals involved will be happy to respond to any frivolous lawsuit from Mr. Trump.''
Mr. Trump's lawsuit quotes from the testimony of Anthony Cuomo, a former tax assessor who, in pleading guilty, explained that corrupt assessors ''would raise values on many particular properties'' to hide the fact that they were lowering taxes on others. The lawsuit said Ronald P. Iannelli, who set the assessment of Trump World Tower and other buildings on the Upper East Side, was indicted and pleaded guilty to bribery.
Mr. Trump complained that his building was assessed at $149 a square foot, far higher than, say, the Vanderbilt, a building on 40th Street, where the comparable number was $72.65.
The lawsuit presents a marketing challenge for Mr. Trump, who normally drapes his projects in superlatives like tallest building and most expensive apartments. He is saying that his assessment should be comparable to those of buildings that he would have considered below his standards.
For instance, he said, 515 Park Avenue, where apartments command some of the highest prices in the city, is assessed at $141 a square foot, $8 less than Trump World Tower. ''My building is much more beautiful,'' Mr. Trump said, ''but mine's on First Avenue.''
HERE we sit in suspense, wondering if New York will be host to the Republican National Convention in 2004, and who better to give the odds than Maureen J. Reidy?
She's the executive director of NYC & Company's permanent host committee, a title that suggests someone who will be passing canapés to the members of the delegating committees, which, you better believe, Ms. Reidy is not. She is a businesswoman, and the role of her office, created last summer, is to attract big events to New York and see that things run smoothly. Really big events, generating really big money. Political conventions, the Super Bowl, the Grammy Awards, events that were handled in the past by ad hoc committees.
Ms. Reidy was hired too late in the game to play a formative role in pursuing the Democratic and Republican conventions. But she has been deeply involved since July, coordinating everything for convention representatives from visits to Madison Square Garden to a welcome reception at ABC studios (for the Democrats) to putting together a special performance by Broadway actors (for the Republicans).
The Democrats announced last week that they were going to Boston -- but will we be getting the Republicans?
''The Republican Committee would get a chance to host an event in a legendary location with an A-list venue,'' Ms. Reidy says, in a litany she will repeat so often that one begins to suspect she has been implanted with a tape loop. ''We have 66,000 hotel rooms, from luxury to low cost to fill any budget, 15,000 at a cost of $150 and under; the best security; unparalleled experience with large events.''
Etc.
She sheds no light on whether the Republicans are coming.
You know those dessert toppings that harden up in seconds? The really shiny ones? This is the image that comes to mind after two hours with Ms. Reidy, 33. She looks fabulous, walking into a borrowed conference room at City Hall. (Her own office is being relocated.) She has long, shining hair, high heels, trim skirt. She's certainly a quality item: as a college senior, she was recruited by all the Big Six accounting firms. Her business credentials include four years as president of the Miss Universe Organization, which, according to her résumé, brought a 122 percent increase in revenue.
But she is also, on first meeting, guarded. The life story is one that has been told before, in some instances word for word. On working for Donald Trump: ''I learned the art of the deal from the master of the deal.'' A few personal items of the autobio are confirmed: she was indeed the head of the cheerleading squad at the University of Maryland. But she deals with questions she prefers not to answer in the manner of a well-schooled Miss Universe. She pauses. She smiles. She does not necessarily answer the question.
MS. Reidy grew up in Smithtown, on Long Island. Her father was a New York City firefighter, her mother a high school math teacher. She received a college degree in accounting, joined Price Waterhouse, supervising audits for entertainment clients. Then she ran into Donald Trump at a benefit. ''He asked me all these questions, what I did, what deals I had worked on,'' Ms. Reidy says. ''I thought he was interested in hiring Price Waterhouse. For a week I studied real estate. I went up to the tower, here I am, thinking, 'I'm going to make partner, I'm going to bring in the Trump account.' ''
Long story short: Mr. Trump hired Ms. Reidy as the chief internal auditor for the Trump Organization. She did the due diligence when Mr. Trump and CBS bought the Miss Universe Organization, a $10 million acquisition. Nine months after she joined him, Mr. Trump and Leslie Moonves, president of CBS, asked her to run Miss Universe and its sister pageants, Miss USA and Miss Teen USA.
''It was losing millions of dollars, the ratings were declining, I didn't think the company was in tune with the women of today. The modern woman is about personal best. You can work and be smart and be beautiful. That's the whole package. We sold half of it to CBS, that was Donald -- Mr. Trump's -- idea. It was brilliant. Not only did you have an equity partner, you had TV broadcasting.''
Her role, as she saw it, was to ''reposition'' and ''rebrand.'' She brought in producers who had done the top television awards shows. (When she first arrived, she notes, one set had been a riverboat.) She recruited clothing designers as sponsors. Each pageant was linked to a charity.
Ms. Reidy is beautiful. Did she ever consider entering a beauty contest? She makes a little face that says, in so many words, ick.
Maybe she thought they were silly?
''No, not that. I, it never crossed my mind, as a teenager or woman, that it was something to do.''
Currently on the host committee wish list is the Super Bowl, probably in 2008. Right, says Ms. Reidy, it has never been in New York. The preferred temperature is above 50 degrees.
So what can they propose? They can't control the weather. A playful tone, finally, from Ms. Reidy: ''We're going to say New York would be so fantastic the weather requirement wouldn't matter.''
Then, more seriously, ''An A-list venue. The No. 1 media market. Sixty-six thousand hotel rooms . . .''
Bill Berry, a jazz trumpeter and big band leader who performed with Duke Ellington and Woody Herman, died here on Wednesday. He was 72.
The cause was lung cancer, his wife, Betty Berry, said.
Mr. Berry performed in the big bands of Herman and Maynard Ferguson before joining Ellington's band for three years in 1961.
Ellington was a major influence on Mr. Berry, who went on to play and teach music in a career that spanned more than 50 years. For several years, Mr. Berry was musical director of the Monterey Jazz Festival.
Born William Richard Berry in Benton Harbor, Mich., he spent his early years traveling with his parents, who were on the road in bands themselves. By 5, Mr. Berry could play the piano. Later he turned to the trumpet and traveled through the Midwest before serving for four years in the Air Force.
Mr. Berry studied at the Cincinnati College of Music and attended Berklee College of Music in Boston.
He later played with the Thad Jones-Mel Lewis orchestra and led his own big band in New York. He joined Merv Griffin's television show in 1965 and was featured on the show for the next 15 years.
When Mr. Griffin moved to Los Angeles, Mr. Berry followed him and re-formed his group as the L.A. Big Band in 1971.
He continued leading the band part time for the next 30 years while also touring with Louie Bellson and doing studio work.
Mr. Berry is survived by his wife; a son, William Berry of Englewood, Colo.; and a daughter, Lisa McLaughlin, of Tallmadge, Ohio.
Many experts have told doctors for years that diuretics, a type of medicine that costs just pennies a day, are the best drugs to treat high blood pressure.
But those recommendations have been nearly drowned out by the major drug companies, which have poured hundreds of millions of dollars into marketing their newer and higher-priced blood pressure medicines, particularly calcium channel blockers and ACE inhibitors.
Analysts say that the results of the government study that were announced yesterday were likely to have little effect on sales of the newer drugs, in part because drug makers will continue to urge doctors to prescribe their medicines as additional treatments for heart patients who need more than one drug to control their blood pressure.
The study, the largest hypertension trial ever, found that diuretics work better than the newer medicines to treat high blood pressure and also prevent some forms of heart disease.
The study specifically included Norvasc, a calcium channel blocker sold by Pfizer, which is expected to bring in nearly $4 billion in sales this year, and lisinopril, an ACE inhibitor sold as Prinivil by Merck & Company and as Zestril by AstraZeneca. Lisinopril lost its patent protection in June and sales are now declining.
Dr. Curt D. Furberg, an author of yesterday's study, said that over the years, companies have heavily promoted the newer drugs as being superior. ''They also bashed the diuretics,'' he said, ''more based on opinion than fact.''
Because diuretics are generic drugs sold by companies that do not spend money on marketing, he said, there was no promotional effort to counter the claims of the drug makers selling the new treatments.
''We find out now that we've wasted a lot of money,'' said Dr. Furberg, a professor of public health sciences at Wake Forest University. ''In addition, it has probably caused harm to patients.''
Researchers have conducted numerous studies that suggest that the heavy marketing of the brand name drugs may be leading doctors to underuse diuretics.
Drug companies have marketed their medicines by advertising them in medical journals, by inviting doctors to meetings and dinners where studies paid for by the companies are discussed and by hiring sales representatives to knock on physicians' doors.
A 1995 study showed that diuretic use declined to 27 percent from 56 percent of antihypertensive prescriptions between 1982 and 1992. If the prescriptions had stayed at the 1982 level, the study said, the health care system would have saved $3.1 billion.
Another study, published in The New England Journal of Medicine in 1998, reviewed 70 medical journal articles that discussed calcium channel blockers and found that 96 percent of the authors who supported the drugs had financial relationships with the drugs' makers. Among the researchers who published work critical of the drugs, only 37 percent received financial support from the companies making the products.
In 1999, researchers at Massachusetts General Hospital reported that calcium-channel blockers were the most heavily advertised drug in the New England Journal of Medicine in 1996, while there were no ads for diuretics.
Officials at drug companies said yesterday that their marketing efforts had not induced doctors to prescribe the wrong drugs.
''Physicians still are in control,'' said Christopher Loder, a spokesman for Merck. ''Doctors will not prescribe a medicine unless it delivers value.''
Drug industry executives said they agreed with the latest study's finding about the importance of prescribing diuretics. But they said many patients find that their blood pressure is not controlled with a single medication, leaving an important place for their products. The companies also said that some patients cannot tolerate the diuretics.
Donald Trump said yesterday that his Trump Hotels & Casino Resorts planned to sell debt early next year in order to pay off older debt, after reporting its biggest quarterly profit in six years.
The company canceled a planned sale of $470 million of bonds rated below investment grade in May rejecting the 13 percent interest rate that investors wanted. Trump Hotels applied on Dec. 20 to the New Jersey Casino Control Commission for approval to sell the same amount of notes backed by mortgages maturing in 2011.
A securities offering may be easier this time, after the company reported its biggest profit in six years in the third quarter as revenue rose at some of its casinos, and the average interest rate for debt rated below investment grade fell.
''Our results were good, and the market is much better than it was a year ago,'' Mr. Trump said. ''We could have done the issue in May, but we weren't happy with the interest rates.''
Credit Suisse First Boston and Deutsche Bank will manage the new note sale, Mr. Trump said. The securities will be offered in the early part of the year, he said.
The new notes will be backed by a first mortgage on the Trump Marina Hotel Casino, and a first mortgage and preferred ship mortgage on the Trump Indiana Riverboat Casino and Hotel, the filing said. Trump Holdings and Funding's 15.5 percent notes due in June 2005 are rated CCC by Standard & Poor's and Caa3 by Moody's.
There was the matter of bingo.
Fredericka Mabon did not really want to have bingo at the Lenox Hill Senior Center at St. Peter's Church in Manhattan. No knock on bingo, but elderly people hunched over bingo cards brought to her mind an uninviting image of old age. The game fed a stubborn stereotype of senior centers.
People who came to the Lenox Hill center said they did not want bingo, either. But Ms. Mabon, the director, wanted to see if they meant it. So she got a bingo cage. Set up a game. One woman played. She won everything.
The marketplace spoke. That was the first and last bingo game. These were Ms. Mabon's kind of people.
The elderly who patronize the center, which opened a year and a half ago inside St. Peter's, at Lexington Avenue and 54th Street, view old age more robustly than past generations. For instance, many of them don't care for the word ''senior.'' To them, it hangs heavy with the symptomatology of frail, sedentary people. That's not them.
So even though the official name of the center has ''senior'' in it, they prefer to call it St. Peter's Place, a destination for the ''new older adult.''
''The new older adult is someone who still has something to contribute,'' said Ms. Mabon, a warm woman of 63, whom everyone calls Ricky. ''Doesn't want to be seen as an anachronism. Still active. Still healthy. Well educated. Better off financially. A lot of these people never thought of themselves as going to a senior center. But when they came here, it didn't feel like a senior center.''
The center bustles with vigor. The average age of members is about 70, compared with 77 for regulars at other centers throughout the city. There are many 60-year-olds.
Outlook as well as age defines the members. While some will gladly elaborate on their innumerable afflictions, most exercise restraint. They are upbeat. One day, the center had a doctor come to talk about cancer. No one attended. Who wanted to hear about that? Someone suggested setting up a bereavement group, but the members didn't want it.
Many old people no longer act or think like old people. So a concern for senior centers is how to make themselves relevant to the ''younger'' elderly while continuing to serve the ''older'' elderly, who are themselves rapidly enlarging in number. Centers now attract people from 60 to more than 100.
Edwin Mendez-Santiago, the city's commissioner of the Department for the Aging, which finances and advises centers for the elderly, said directors are trying to wrap their imaginations around this challenge by experimenting with their program blends -- offering things like yoga, meditation, Shakespeare classes. Some serve occasional cold meals and salads for the younger elderly who are mindful of their diets.
Mr. Mendez-Santiago mentioned that the United Hindu Cultural Council Senior Center, a new center in South Ozone Park, Queens, catering largely to the Indian population, is the first in the city to serve all-vegetarian meals. He said the department has urged centers to start walking clubs for more active members.
''Senior centers are much more than a place for bingo,'' he said. ''That's what we're trying to promote.''
But the effort to embrace a broader mix of people and activities is complicated by constricting budgets -- an age boom colliding at considerable velocity with an economic bust. Many centers could use spiffier and larger spaces, more programs, more staff, more everything.
Being new, St. Peter's Place occupies an airy, well-kept expanse on the plaza level of the church. The center is a joint enterprise of Lenox Hill Neighborhood House, St. Peter's and United Neighbors of East Midtown. In the late morning of a chilly day, it vibrated with activity.
Centers for the elderly are often a refuge from loneliness and despair, the contagions of old age. Mary Bates, 75, wandered past with a blissful smile. She began coming in April. ''I was going through a little state of depression,'' she said. ''A close traveling companion passed away, and I was left adrift.''
Someone told her about St. Peter's Place. ''I envisioned it as a sort of soup kitchen with Oliver coming around asking: 'More? More?' '' she said. ''It's nothing like that. It's like a picnic.''
She likes to have the lunch, and does an exercise class twice a week. She is a notary public, and on Friday she offers members of the center her services. The only remuneration expected is a thank you.
Carmela Zein, 67, was reading the paper. She walks to the center from nearby. She used to sell cars on Long Island. Her husband died last year, and she sold the house in East Moriches and moved to Manhattan. Her daughter and son-in-law insisted she get out and connect with a senior center. She chose St. Peter's because of its vitality.
''Selling cars, I'm used to an interactive, active environment,'' she said. ''I'm not ready to just sit.''
Lunch was sausage and peppers. People sat at tables of six. No saving seats -- that way people mixed more.
Richard Rowe, 70, who was dressed smartly in a tie, said: ''This is a cheery place. It's not a warehouse.''
Anna Caruso, 73, said: ''It's a very friendly place. You get to know everyone.''
Mr. Rowe added, ''We emphasize sharing thoughts and not kvetching.''
He shared some information about his mother, who died at 94. ''She was a recluse,'' he said. ''Her idea of a good time was to sauté mushrooms at midnight with a brandy and watch 'Dracula.' ''
A tablemate said, ''No kidding, 'Dracula'?''
Mr. Rowe continued: ''My motto is 'Life is not a dress rehearsal.' I go out dancing as much as possible. I think seniors should just get out and not be intimidated by youth. You should just go out and have fun at your pace and not worry about what you're doing incorrectly.''
Ms. Caruso said: ''I do meditation. Does me wonders.''
Ms. Mabon, the director, said: ''In running the center, I try to think about how I would like to be treated. And I do identify with some of the members. I've noticed how your knees get a little stiffer. You lose family. And in the back of everyone's head is, 'How valuable will I be?' That's a real existential question: what is life after the working life? What do you do with yourself?''
The arts and crafts group was making ornaments.
Bibi Gajraj, 71, comes from Elmhurst, Queens, to participate. She tried a center near her but didn't care for it. ''They were interested in cards,'' she said. ''Many were invalids. They seemed older.''
Doris Diez, 78, who commutes to the center from the Upper West Side, said: ''This is a center where I don't feel 78. I feel 16. The people who go to some of the other places come in with their backs crooked and grumble, grumble, grumble this and grumble, grumble, grumble that, and 'Who opened the window?' Here we laugh.''
Another day. The Seniors Resourcing Solutions group was holding its weekly session. In essence, it is a business group for members not ready for full retirement from work.
Around the table, members spoke in turn about their activities. A woman was crocheting handbags. Someone else was doing part-time work at H & R Block. A man stressed, ''I'm not retired or semi-retired, I'm working.'' He was doing word-processing, graphic design and bookkeeping for small businesses. Molly Blayney, the chairwoman of the group, said she was a writer and editor and was hunting for a new project.
A member mentioned that someone had noted that he was 65, and he wanted to point out that he actually would not be 65 for another 20 minutes.
There was discussion about a flier advertising the group. Some members didn't like a graphic that depicted an elderly man and a not-so-elderly woman.
''She looks about 40.''
''She looks about 12.''
''Why don't we show that we're reasonably attractive people at 60?''
''I have a picture of Grandma Moses you could use.''
There was discussion of a good idea that Julian White had had. He learned that a bank was paying a $20 bonus for new accounts opened by seniors: $10 to the applicant and $10 to the person who recommended the bank. Mr. White told the group to identify him as the person who had referred them and he would contribute his $10 bonuses to the group.
A member mentioned a friend, a jazz pianist who wanted to talk to the group. He was interested in advice to help revive his career.
Someone said: ''I've got connections in the music field. I was just on the radio with Joe Franklin, and I could get him on Joe Franklin.''
At the other end of the center, Gloria Jaeger, 74, was bouncing around. She is a regular.
''I'm here almost every day,'' she said. ''There's an atmosphere that makes me feel young, even though I'm 74. My feeling is I'm going back to school, and I was a happy student.''
She rarely misses lunch. ''It's so hard to cook for one,'' she said. ''If I make a beef stew, I have to eat it for a month. Who wants to eat beef stew for a month?''
The Stretch n' Strengthen group was well into its paces. The class is mostly for those not limber enough for the yoga group, which has members who can still stand on their heads. A tai chi group meets on another day.
''Hands on the table,'' the leader said. ''Now step back as far as you can go and stretch. Bend down at the waist. Keep bending as far as you can. Keep bending. And relax.''
In the back room, French lessons were in progress. This was fun French. No grammar. Just words to use. Today, parts of the body: ''la bouche,'' ''l'oeil,'' ''le bras.''
Most of the students were learning because it was enjoyable and they found the language beautiful. Or they were still dreaming. One woman said she planned to win the lottery and buy a house in France, adding, ''You're never too old for that.''
ARE the good times over? The answer is yes.
That's the question -- and the answer -- for bond investors going into this year after the fixed-income market outperformed stocks in 2002, for the third consecutive year. That is a three-year run not seen since 1939 to 1941, making it a first for most investors. So savor the returns.
Over the three-year span, the total return from the fixed-income market, including Treasuries and corporates, was 33.6 percent, in contrast to a negative return, including dividends, of 37.5 percent in the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index. Bonds have outperformed stocks so much over the last three years that if investors had put their money into Treasury bonds as far back as March 1994 and ignored stocks, they would be even with investors who put all their money into stocks. The overall return for both markets was about 120 percent.
In the third year of this run for bonds, high-quality fixed-income securities, especially high-rated corporates and Treasury bonds and notes, did the best. But those who had a taste for risk did well in emerging-markets bonds, despite declines in bonds from Argentina and Brazil.
As for this year, Mary J. Miller, assistant director of the fixed-income division at T. Rowe Price Associates, the mutual fund company, said, ''It doesn't have to be a disastrous year for fixed income.''
But to avoid disaster, she said, investors will have to take on increased risk by moving into high-yield junk bonds and lower-rated investment-grade bonds because those sectors will be hurt less if interest rates rise, as forecast. The Treasury market, which would suffer the most as rates climb, is a no-no.
Jack V. Malvey, chief global fixed-income strategist at Lehman Brothers, agreed, saying, ''Lower-quality debt will be the star in 2003.'' He forecasts a return of only 4 to 5 percent in the broad fixed-income market. That means declines in bond prices would eat into the interest investors were paid on their fixed-income securities.
Bonds could even have a negative year, he warned, if the economy is a little stronger than expected and the Federal Reserve raises its benchmark short-term interest rate sooner than the second half of the year and more than the expected half a percentage point.
If this forecast sounds like last year's, it should, because this is basically what analysts were saying at the end of 2001. ''We were joking internally that we could practically take the 2002 outlook and change the numbers a little and put it out again,'' Mr. Malvey said.
He said 2002 turned out to be different from what was expected because analysts had been too optimistic about the strength of the recovery, had not expected the threat of a war with Iraq and had yet to realize how Enron and the corporate scandals that followed would undermine investors' confidence.
Although the economy is not expected to be robust this year, growth of 2.5 to 3 percent should preclude worries of a double-dip recession, which may make investors willing to take on more risk.
And many forecasters are expecting growth to be steady enough by the second half of the year for Fed policy makers to push their benchmark rate, now at 1.25 percent, a little higher.
All that spells modestly higher interest rates, with some analysts forecasting that the yield on the Treasury's 10-year note, which ended 2002 at 3.82 percent, will be up to 4.5 percent by the end of this year. Shorter-term rates are expected to rise more if the Fed nudges its benchmark rate up. The Treasury's two-year note, which ended 2002 at 1.60 percent, could rise to 3 percent.
Another negative for bonds could be the stock market. In recent years, the two markets have moved in opposite directions, with Treasury prices falling when stock prices rose, and vice versa. If that relationship continues, even a modest stock rebound this year will spell trouble for bonds.
But forecasters were fooled last year and could be again. One unknown is whether there will be war with Iraq. Stocks could fall and the bond market rise if a war approaches. But if the history of the Persian Gulf war is replayed, an early sign of success could send stocks higher and bonds lower.
''Every economist I know reserves the right to redraw the outlook when the events occur,'' said Alan D. Levenson, chief economist at T. Rowe Price.
Another unknown is the federal budget deficit. The cost of any war and the cost of rebuilding Iraq in the aftermath could add a lot to the deficit. And if the Bush administration wins tax cuts to stimulate the economy, that could make the deficit balloon further.
So far, analysts and investors seem unworried about the deficit, which grew to $159 billion in the 2002 fiscal year, which ended Sept. 30, in contrast with a surplus of $127 billion the year before.
Some deficit forecasts for this fiscal year are already over $250 billion. The belief is that these deficits will begin to shrink as the economy grows. But if investors begin to doubt that, more upward pressure on interest rates could follow.
Over all in 2002, the fixed-income market -- including Treasuries, agencies, investment-grade corporate bonds and mortgages -- had a total return of 10.4 percent, after returns of 8.3 percent in 2001 and 11.7 percent in 2000, according to Merrill Lynch bond indexes. The S.& P. 500 fell 23.4 percent, 13 percent and 10.1 percent in the last three years.
Interest rates fell to lows not seen in more than four decades as the expected economic recovery stumbled and investors worried in the summer about the possibility of a double dip into a second recession.
Corporate accounting scandals and corruption at companies like WorldCom and Tyco International made investors wary of risk. That contributed, with the economic worries and the growing possibility of a war with Iraq, to a temporary seizing up of the corporate bond market in July that made trading nearly impossible.
Finally, Federal Reserve policy makers were worried enough about the outlook to cut their benchmark short-term interest rate in November by half a percentage point, to 1.25 percent, a 41-year low.
In this environment, the Treasury market became a haven for many investors. The yield on the Treasury's 10-year note fell as low as 3.57 percent, a 44-year low for securities with maturities of 10 years. The two-year note's year-end yield of 1.60 percent was a 58-year low.
The interest rate on the average 30-year mortgage, which was dragged lower by the decline in Treasury yields, fell to 5.93 percent, the lowest since 1965, according to Freddie Mac, the mortgage lender.
For the year, the total return from Treasury notes and bonds was 11.6 percent, according to Merrill Lynch, up from 6.7 percent in 2001 but down from the 13.4 percent return in 2000. But Treasuries were outdone by higher quality corporate bonds, which investors bought for their relative safety and higher yields.
Investment-grade bonds rated double A (few companies are rated triple A) had a total return of 12.3 percent, well above the return of 7.1 percent for triple-B-rated companies. Single A corporate bonds returned 12.6 percent.
Despite a strong recovery in November and December when the total return from high-yield bonds was 8.2 percent (annualized, that would be 59 percent), junk bonds still had a down year. Yields were above 12 percent, but the sector's total return was a minus 1.9 percent.
Emerging-markets bonds had a return of 14.2 percent, although the return was a negative 5.6 percent for Argentine bonds and a negative 3.3 percent for Brazilian bonds, according to J. P. Morgan bond indexes. Two of the best-performing emerging-markets bonds were those from Russia, with a return of 35.9 percent, and Turkey, with a return of 20.7 percent.
The American Contract Bridge League's Bridge Week continues today with special activities in clubs around the continent. It commemorates the Culbertson-Lenz match of 1931-32, which projected the game onto the front pages of American newspapers for the first and last time.
The diagramed deal has become notorious. Sidney Lenz, who was North here, clung to the idea, abandoned by everyone else even in those early days, that new suit responses to a one-of-a-suit opening should not be forcing. This resulted in trouble here. He could not bid one spade, or even two spades, without risking a pass from his partner, Oswald Jacoby.
As it happened, Jacoby, who could well have opened four hearts, would not have passed any plausible response. His opening one heart was semipsychic, a tactic to which he was addicted. He may have been afraid of missing a spade fit, which was a small paradox in view of the result.
When Lenz responded three no-trump, Jacoby thought he was ending the bidding with four hearts. He had not bargained for Lenz's notorious no-trump addiction, and the older man bid four no-trump, intent on scoring 150 for aces. In those days four no-trump did not have any specialized meaning.
Jacoby naturally persevered with five hearts, at which point Lenz made a dreadful bid of six no-trump. Ely Culbertson, who was West, speculated with a double, and Jacoby carried on to seven hearts. At last, much too late, Lenz passed and this contract, also doubled, had to fail by a trick.
But seven spades would have been easy, and neither player had managed to bid that suit. Jacoby did not really have an opportunity to do so. But Lenz could well have bid spades at his second or third turn, on the principle that one should always give partner another option rather than persevere on a single track.
The fascinating question, which must remain unanswered, is this: What would Josephine Culbertson, as East, have led against six no-trump, doubled or undoubled? It would have taken a club lead to destroy the contract, and that would have resulted in a two- or three-trick defeat. After any other lead Lenz would have been able to establish and run the hearts, using South's spade honors as the crucial entries. He would have had an enormous score, and recorded the 150 for four aces in one hand that had so influenced his bidding.
As part of Bridge Week, the Manhattan Club, 22 West 72nd Street, will stage club championships each day.
COMPUTER game designers do not need graduate degrees in business to figure out that profits tend to be highly correlated with crashes, explosions, combat, high-risk gambles, sex or just about anything else that is arousing.
''People who buy games want to get excited,'' said Dr. George Fuller von Bozzay, a stress management specialist.
But Dr. Fuller and others in his business have long been interested in radically different games designed specifically to reward players for being calm and staying that way. Games, in short, like Relax to Win, a race between two friendly looking dragons named George and Georgina created recently by the Mindgames research group at the M.I.T. Media Lab Europe in Dublin.
Relax to Win was designed as a tool to help troubled children, including those with anxiety disorders and attention-deficit disorders, gain control over their behavior. But the designers are also excited about hints of broader potential.
''We've had a lot of C.E.O.'s saying they'd love to play it before they go into a board meeting,'' said Gary McDarby, a 35-year-old biomedical engineer who heads the Mindgames research team.
Relax to Win, aimed at children 8 to 12 years old, is set against a rich but relatively uncluttered landscape somewhere deep in outer space. The dragons, one red and one green, move along parallel, elevated pathways as the camera angle floats from side to side above them. There is a repetitive keyboard soundtrack interspersed with occasional electronic exclamations as they move between their three gaits: walking, running and flying.
To play the game, children stick two fingers into sensor-filled pads that track galvanic skin response, a measure of electric current in the skin that rises or falls with anxiety levels. The more serene players can make themselves, the faster their dragon moves.
Most children find the counterintuitive competition mesmerizing even though the races are often over within a minute, according to the inventors. When John Sharry, a psychologist on the Mindgames team, videotaped his sons, Daniel and David, playing a prototype earlier this year, David, 7, told him, ''You ought to send this to every child in the world.''
While such enthusiasm has been associated with biofeedback games since the early days of the personal computer revolution, the actual products have never seemed to catch fire in the marketplace.
''It was my favorite technology of all my years in the business and the only one that didn't work out,'' said Ronald F. Gordon, who was first exposed to the computer game industry as president of Atari in the 1970's. Mr. Gordon founded The Other 90% Technologies to create biofeedback computer games in 1994, and its skiing game, in which players had to be focused but relaxed to stay on course, was widely distributed in stores like CompUSA by 1997. But Mr. Gordon folded the venture in 1998 after it had lost $6.5 million.
The inventions that have come and gone include variations on classic games like Pong and Pac-Man (in the latter, the yellow protagonist turned black when the player was too excited).
Many biofeedback game experts say the failure of the field to become more popular is one of the mysteries of the computer age, although there are plenty of possible explanations. Some games flopped because they were too cluttered to allow players to relax, and others were too boring. Mr. McDarby tried to overcome such problems by using a multidisciplinary team including artists, computer experts and psychologists for Relax to Win, but experts say he was not the first to do so.
The challenges go well beyond design issues, according to executives in the industry. Many people who are initially impressed turn out to be ambivalent about paying close enough attention to their bodies' responses to benefit from biofeedback, according to Hal Myers, co-founder of Thought Technology, a Montreal-based company that sells biofeedback equipment and supporting software, including games. ''People are lazy,'' Mr. Myers said. ''They want something done for them or to them.''
That may not be true of avid game players, but they are an even tougher audience for designers of games like Relax to Win.
''The No.1 law of a good game is high rewards or high risks, but that's not relaxing,'' Mr. Gordon said.
Companies like Thought Technology that have successfully marketed biofeedback games in small quantities focus on niche markets, like therapists who treat attention deficit disorder. But focusing on health applications severely limits marketing opportunities. And game designers have to be cautious about their claims because the games have not been subjected to the types of rigorous trials that drugs must undergo, Mr. Gordon said.
Many doctors, moreover, question the assumptions of the game designers about the value of biofeedback. Medicare and major insurance plans accept biofeedback as a well-documented method of treatment for many bowel and bladder problems and for rehabilitation of injured muscles. But insurers and many doctors say that widespread claims that biofeedback can treat anxiety and attention disorders have never been adequately proved.
One hurdle is that many biofeedback devices were based on what now seem to be oversimplified models of the brain's electrical activity and its relation to functions like skin conductivity or heart rate. As the neuroscientists' models of brain-wave activity become more complex, so does the challenge of linking brains and bodies to electronic games in ways that produce predictably therapeutic results.
''You can count on two hands the number of people doing really good work on biologically controlled computers,'' said Dr. R. Benjamin Knapp, an electrical engineer from Stanford University who was a co-founder of BioControl Systems, created in 1989 to develop devices that connect the brain to electronics.
Relax to Win is still in the prototype stage, but it has moved out of the lab and into Mater Hospital in Dublin, where Mr. Sharry is testing its effects on children with severe anxiety disorders. Mr. Sharry said that the study was going well but had only four children enrolled so far and that this group represented the easiest test for the game.
''Children who are anxious know they need to relax,'' he said. ''Treating attention deficit disorder is a much more complex question because there is a lot of debate over what it means and how to treat it.''
Indeed, many doctors who treat attention deficit disorder in the United States say that proper treatment may well require teaching children to raise their arousal level, not lower it, if their problem is not complicated by symptoms of hyperactivity. Biofeedback games can only be one part of effective therapy, they say, but many of them are already believers in their value.
''ADD treatment is probably our biggest market,'' said Mr. Myers of Thought Technology. He said the company has sold 400,000 GSR2's, which resemble a computer mouse but measure galvanic skin response, the same electrical signals monitored by the sensors of Relax to Win. He said his company was constantly inventing new games, including a recent program that allows a child who meets the doctor's biofeedback targets to hit a clown in the face with a pie.
There is a six-foot chain-link fence separating Claire Shannon from all she detests, but she does not want to poke through it.
An active member of the National Organization for Women and veteran of women's liberation battles, Ms. Shannon lives behind the Augusta National Golf Club. Her backyard is the club's backyard, and on tournament days she can hear the swell of the crowd from her kitchen window.
But despite the club's men-only membership policy, Ms. Shannon is not joining any of the threatened protests when the club holds its Masters tournament in April.
''That's not the hill I want to die on,'' she said.
The Masters Cinema. The Masters Laundromat. Masters Janitorial Services. The Masters Table (a soup kitchen).
Augusta is the Masters. And people here seem to identify so strongly with the tournament that in this dispute, the vast majority are backing Augusta National. Or keeping their thoughts to themselves.
Like Ms. Shannon, Lowell Greenbaum, chairman of the local Democratic Party, says he is bothered by the men-only policy.
''On the one hand, we believe in equal rights for all and disagree strongly with Augusta National,'' Dr. Greenbaum said. ''But on the other hand, we don't want to damage the club. It puts food on our tables.''
It may seem strange that one of the world's most exclusive country clubs, a place that put Bill Gates on a waiting list and did not have a black member until 1990, is in a town that just got its first Starbucks. But when Augusta National was built 70 years ago, Augusta was like the Riviera of the South. Over the years, the club has remained the town's link to its sepia-toned past -- and its lifeline.
The club pumps millions of dollars into local charities. It delivers a ''13th month'' of business during Masters week. It shapes the image of the city, population 200,000, and gives many residents a sense of pride.
''It is our one claim to greatness,'' said Bruce Palmer Freshley, owner of an Augusta jewelry shop.
On Tuesday, the Augusta Commission will meet to tighten the rules regarding protests. Several women's groups and the Rev. Jesse Jackson have said they will picket in front of club gates during the Masters. No way, local officials have said.
''They can't be at the main gate because of traffic,'' said Col. Gary Powell of the Richmond County Sheriff's Office.
Colonel Powell's solution: a ball field half a mile away.
Some people interviewed seemed mindful of saying the wrong thing, lest they lose their Masters tickets, worth as much as $5,000.
''I better not get in trouble for talking,'' said Barbara Gordon, publisher of The Metro Courier, a black newspaper, as she waved an application for tickets. ''These credentials are worth their weight in gold.''
There is an old Georgia saying that in Macon people want to know which church you go to. In Savannah, it is what you will have to drink. In Atlanta, it is how much money you make. And in Augusta, it is who your mother and grandmother are.
Tradition is not toyed with here. The town library employs a full-time genealogist. Cotillions and debutantes are still a big deal, as they were in Augusta's heyday in the 1920's and 30's when the town attracted rich Northerners to its resorts along the Savannah River.
''This is a place that still embraces tradition and structure, even if that structure is a little artificial,'' explained Mr. Freshley, who married into one of Augusta's society's families.
Nothing is a grander symbol than Augusta National. The club is so purposely old school its guest cabins are furnished in hues of decades past and sodas and pimento cheese sandwiches at the Masters tournament go for little more than a dollar.
Augusta National has a mystique, locals say, even though most have never set foot inside. Rumors say the golf course is somehow dry right after a rain (partly true, because of special blow dryers); that the club had a hand in choosing the week of daylight saving time (not true); and that Augusta National's grass really is greener (depends).
And the tournament is often an important marker in people's lives. Kids grow up selling lemonade to well-fleeced visitors who cannot be bothered to break a buck. As teenagers, they work the course as ''sanitation specialists'' or ''rope jockeys.''
Schools close down that week, even the state university. Families rent out their homes and throw parties. Some get as much as $25,000, for a week.
''It's like Christmas,'' said Mr. Freshley, whose face glows at talk of the Masters. ''But better.''
Yet, not everyone celebrates.
Ms. Gordon, the newspaper publisher, said the Masters is a lot like the sport of golf: white-bread. Few teenagers who work at the course are black. And visitors who stream into town by the thousands stay out of the black neighborhoods.
Even though she considers the club racist and chauvinistic, she is not going to join any protests.
''Honestly, I don't really care where rich white women play golf,'' Ms. Gordon said. ''We've been excluded for years. Why did it take white women so long to figure this out?''
Martha Burk, chairwoman of the National Council of Women's Organizations, said she was disappointed, but not surprised, by the lack of local support.
''I guess I've failed in getting my message across,'' Ms. Burk said. ''This isn't about golf.''
The battle, Ms. Burk said, is about cracking open corporate America. Augusta National's 300 members include the chief executives of the nation's most powerful corporations.
''We're talking about the glass ceiling here,'' she said.
Several club members reached at their homes declined to comment. The club spokesman, Glenn Greenspan, said there were no discussions now about accepting women.
''We believe, as millions of Americans do, that single-gender groups are valid and beneficial,'' Mr. Greenspan said.
Ms. Shannon, 62, who helped fight unfair banking and employment practices in the 1970's and 80's, understands the point and says she has always felt Augusta National was anti-woman.
''But what about reproductive rights and equal pay?'' she asked. ''There are so many more important battles to fight. What am I supposed to do? Go out to club gates and wave a sign? I'd look silly.''
Not long ago I had the opportunity to fish a stretch of trout stream that doesn't see a lot of pressure -- private water, to be precise. This particular river runs much of its course through a ranch owned by a celebrity who uses the 45,000-acre spread as a retreat. And while I've always had a nagging moral problem with private water, I'm not against having fun. So when a friend of mine who owns a fly shop in Montana invited me to join him on a stream very few anglers get permission to fish, naturally I jumped at the chance.
I was out West working on a new book, but with a little too much emphasis on working and not enough on fly-fishing. I'd been living in a tiny log cabin in West Yellowstone for nearly a month. The work was fine, but the days were long, hot and dusty. I was hungry for the chance to relax, cast a fly to a few uneducated trout away from the heavily fished streams around Yellowstone.
The day before we were to fish, the fly-shop owner told me he had called up to the ranch and cleared everything with the owners, who he admitted could be a little ''funny'' about strangers.
The next morning broke clear and hot with the promise of a stiff breeze by midday. I packed my gear in the truck, including a cooler full of good locally brewed beer and sandwich fixings for the two of us, and I drove the short distance to the fly shop. But business had come up and my friend could not go. So he drew a map on his business card.
It was adequate, though decidedly not to scale, and although I didn't get lost, the unpaved part of the trip took much longer than I'd planned. The sun was already high when I passed through an unmarked gate and parked the truck in front of the caretaker's cabin another quarter mile down the two-track ranch road.
The river was a classic Montana freestone stream tumbling out of the nearby mountain range and gathering clear, cold water from countless small tributaries, feeder seeps and springs along the way. At this point in its journey, the stream was still losing altitude fast, making for sections of swift pocket water broken by occasional deep runs and pools. It flowed just a few steps from the caretaker's cabin and divided the ranch from the rest of the world like a moat, spanned only by a single narrow wooden bridge.
I walked around the front of the truck and up the steps of the caretaker's house and knocked at the sun-bleached door. As I waited for an answer, I heard a soft hissing just audible above the voice of the river. I looked back at the truck and noticed a small plume of steam erupting from the slowly deflating right rear tire. I also saw immediately that I'd parked the truck on a fairly steep little slope leading down to the bridge, making it virtually impossible to put up a jack safely.
Without waiting for an answer at the door, I jumped into the truck and drove across the bridge to a level spot just below the main house. I opened the overloaded tailgate and rooted around until I found the jack. I retrieved the jack handle from under the hood and began wrestling the spare from its roost. That's when a deep voice behind me asked just what I thought I was doing.
The voice belonged to a large -- but, mercifully, unarmed -- ranch hand named Dave, who softened up when I mentioned the fly-shop owner's name. Seems the shop owner's idea of ''clearing it'' with the landowner was to leave a message on the caretaker's answering machine, which, naturally, everyone was too busy to check. As a result I wasn't exactly expected. And no one seemed remotely thrilled that I was there.
By the time we'd gotten things cleared up, several other ranch hands had appeared along with the landowner's wife, who rode up on horseback. She knew vaguely who I was and invited me to stay -- provided I agree to three conditions: 1. No photographs of the place. 2. Return all fish to the stream. 3. Never, ever tell anyone I'd been there. This last part she said with as polite and sweet an or-I'll-turn-my-boys-here-loose-on-you as I'd ever heard. I agreed, of course, and went back to the business of changing my tire.
By now the sun was directly overhead, and a breeze had kicked up, stirring the dry corral into small columns of dust that swirled around me as the temperature edged toward 90. And I was no closer to fishing than I'd been all day.
I offered Dave and the other boys a beer and jacked up the truck. I changed the tire as the boys sat on a fence and drank their beers. They got into a discussion of their respective high school football injuries and took turns climbing into the teetering three-wheeled truck to pluck another beer out of my cooler.
I did eventually fish the stream. I had the water to myself, the fish were easy to fool, and I forgot all about the work I'd left behind. So I guess it worked out pretty much the way I'd hoped. But I couldn't get away from the nagging feeling that this stream was no different from any other stream I'd fished out there, with one exception: the 70 square miles surrounding it belonged to a guy who lived in New York City.
I felt like Cinderella, invited to a swanky ball for just one night but all the while waltzing with one ear cocked for the tolling of the clock. Private water just ran contrary to my sense of what's fair, although I knew if I owned a nice piece of water, I might hold a different opinion. But for the time being, I decided to stick to the public waters and take my chances of running into other folks like me: ordinary people who work to live and live to fish.
Just before I was going to call it quits for the day, as the sun sank toward the mountains and the breeze began to die, I hooked a nice fish on a Jacklin's hopper I'd slapped under the overhanging branches of a small streamside willow. The trout fought wildly, and when I landed it I saw the 17-inch rainbow had taken the hopper deep and torn itself up. It was clear it wasn't going to survive, with blood in its gills and the fierce fiery color fading from its eyes. I weighed the consequences and decided to keep the fish for my dinner, out of respect.
I didn't feel good about it, but I'd released all the other fish I'd caught, and I knew it was the right thing to do. You'd have done the same. It didn't seem appropriate to continue fishing, so I started back to my truck. At the crest of a high ridge overlooking the stream, I paused to admire the way the low red sun was painting long blue shadows across the sage-green valley and the cluster of buildings that made up the ranch. I stopped just long enough to snap a single photograph and moved on.
Sure, I remembered what the landowner's wife had said and the three rules to which I'd agreed under duress, but I wasn't going to release a dying fish and I couldn't pass up a nice photograph. After all, I rationalized, it wasn't like I was stealing. These wealthy celebrities had a nice ranch, money in the bank and privacy of which the rest of us can only dream. Nothing I did was going to take that away from them -- unless perhaps I broke the third rule.
Irvin Mayfield
Knitting Factory
Irvin Mayfield, a 25-year-old trumpeter from New Orleans, plays in a tremendously appealing jazz-funk-Cuban-African-Brazilian band, Los Hombres Calientes. But he also leads a straight-ahead jazz group, and that side of his work has been by turns impressive and snoozy.
There aren't many trumpeters playing at his level of technique, and at times during a show on Thursday with his quintet, he became a wilder version of Wynton Marsalis, going overboard on vocalization effects and long, ripping, note-stuffed lines. He doesn't write particularly memorable melodies, but they do come in attractive packages, with piquant counterlines provided by the saxophonist Aaron Fletcher and the pianist Victor Atkins.
So much was Wyntonian: Mr. Mayfield's harmonies, his growling and purring through the horn, his alert rhythm section, the gauzy sturdiness of the group sound, the allusions to Coltrane's simmering rhythm section and Ellington's playful arrangements for horns. But the characteristic of Mr. Marsalis's work that this younger musician doesn't necessarily need is its overlay of genteel sophistication; it makes Mr. Mayfield's music seem to be putting on airs.
Mr. Mayfield played part of his new album ''Half Past Autumn Suite,'' (Basin Street Records), written in response to Gordon Parks's photographs and commissioned by the New Orleans Museum of Art. Some was perfunctory, some was inspired. ''Moonscape'' sounded like a gifted student exercise. But ''Evening,'' in which the drummer Jaz Sawyer played correct Brazilian street-samba rhythms, had an original spark. Mr. Mayfield has done his homework on the connections among New Orleans, the Caribbean and Brazil; this sort of thing, as played by a standard jazz small group, is more rare and more special.

 Imagine Paige Rense's surprise when she picked up the newspapers last month to find that Gerald M. Levin was splitting with his wife of 32 years, Barbara Riley Levin. 
 Ms. Rense, the editor in chief of Architectural Digest, had commissioned an article about the Levins' retirement cottage in Key West, Fla., and the March issue including the lavishly illustrated article was then at the printer. It is the nightmare of every editor who has early production deadlines. 
 The issue featuring the Levins, which went to press on Dec. 17, went on sale last week, just as Mr. Levin was back in Manhattan from his new home in Marina del Rey, Calif., with his fiancée, Dr. Laurie Perlman, a psychologist he met last June. 
 "Divorce happens; changes happen," Ms. Rense said. "Actually, we have been pretty fortunate because we haven't been caught out like this too often. 
 "This was not a story about Jerry and Barb Levin," she added. "It is a story about a beautiful home that was decorated by Barbara Levin, who is a former interior designer. I would have done the story no matter who she was married to." 
 That doesn't mean that Ms. Rense is immune to the poignancy of the situation. "It was heart-rending in a way," she said. "It was a happy house as she described it, and I doubt is very happy right now." David Carr 
 Meeting the Fiancé's Old Friends 
 Mr. Levin and Dr. Perlman made a very public debut in New York last Wednesday night at a party for "The Biggest Game of All" (Free Press), a book about deal-making by Leo Hindery Jr., the former chief executive of Global Crossing, with Leslie Cauley. 
 The Champagne flowed for more than two hours in the Grill Room of the Four Seasons restaurant, home to power lunches among the likes of Peter G. Peterson, the chairman of the Blackstone Group; Steven T. Florio, the chief executive of Condé Nast; and S. I. Newhouse Jr., the chairman of Advance Publications. On Wednesday, the room was crowded (very crowded) with friends of Mr. Hindery's and members of the news media. Among the guests were Edward D. Breen, the chief of Tyco International ; Geraldine Laybourne, who started Oxygen, a cable television and Internet network for women; and Richard J. Bressler, the chief financial officer of Viacom .

 The Web's Top Travel Agent Hits the Road 
 The cobbler's children may have no shoes, but Richard N. Barton wasn't going to let his children, or himself, miss out on traveling. Mr. Barton said last week that he would soon step down as chief executive of Expedia , the biggest online travel agency, so he could spend a year in Europe with his family. 
 Mr. Barton, 35, said he had long dreamed of spending a year in Europe. When his wife, Dr. Sarah Marcus, decided to quit her obstetrics practice to spend more time with their three young children, Mr. Barton said it was time to go. He plans to split his time between Tuscany and Paris. 
 Because his resignation would be considered "material information" by securities regulators, he wasn't able to talk to his friends clearly about his plans. "Now they know why I was asking all those strange questions," Mr. Barton said. Saul Hansell 
 Inviting a Critic Into the Tent 
 Before he left Congress last year, John J. LaFalce, as the ranking Democrat on the House Financial Services Committee, sought to curb so-called predatory lending by companies that make loans to people with weak credit ratings. His efforts were opposed, successfully, by many financial institutions, including Household International . 
 Last week, Household appointed its old nemesis, Mr. LaFalce, to a board that it created almost two years ago to advise it on, among other things, how to respond to accusations that it was preying on low-income borrowers by charging hefty fees and high interest rates they could not afford. 
 Mr. LaFalce said consumers should not fret that they have lost an ally. "I view myself as representing the consumer and giving advice on behalf of the consumer," he said. Patrick McGeehan

Ruby Braff, a jazz trumpeter and cornetist who defied the odds by rising to fame in the modern era with a resolutely old-fashioned style, died on Sunday in North Chatham, Mass. He was 75 and lived in Harwich, Mass.
No cause of death was announced, but he had had lung disease for years, said a spokesman for Arbors Records, which released many of his most recent CD's.
In the early and middle 1950's Mr. Braff attracted attention not just for his mellifluous tone and his highly lyrical approach to improvisation but also for his devotion to a type of jazz that, as far as many critics and most of his contemporaries were concerned, had fallen out of vogue years earlier.
At a time when most young trumpet players were following the flash and bravura of Dizzy Gillespie or the acidic melancholy of Miles Davis, Mr. Braff's understated and uncomplicated melodicism was a throwback to the days when Louis Armstrong and Bix Beiderbecke set the standard for the instrument.
Not surprisingly, Mr. Braff made his name by performing and recording with musicians two decades older than he was, including the trombonist Vic Dickenson and the clarinetists Pee Wee Russell and Edmond Hall. Later in his career he became a mentor to a new generation of musicians who shared his fondness for older jazz, among them the saxophonist Scott Hamilton and the guitarist Howard Alden.
Despite Mr. Braff's reputation as a traditionalist, and his insistence that Armstrong was his only influence, neither his repertory nor his playing was mired in the past. He discreetly incorporated some modern harmonic ideas into his work, especially in his later years, and he was always open to a good melody, regardless of when it was written. The critic Harvey Pekar spoke for many admirers when he wrote, ''Though Braff's style is rooted in the 1930's, it doesn't sound dated.''
Even so, Mr. Braff -- who could be as outspoken personally as he was soft-spoken musically -- always maintained, loudly and angrily, that his traditionalist bent hurt his career. He once said that he hardly worked for a five-year period in the late 1950's and early 60's because promoters considered his music outmoded.
By the mid-70's the jazz world had grown considerably more open-minded, and after forming a quartet with the guitarist George Barnes in 1973, Mr. Braff was seldom without work as a headliner.
Reuben Braff was born in Boston on March 16, 1927. A self-taught musician, he began working locally at nightclubs and parties in the 1940's. His first significant musical job was a long engagement as a sideman with Edmond Hall at Boston's Savoy Cafe in 1949. After moving to New York in 1953, Mr. Braff began performing and recording regularly with some of the best-known musicians in the jazz mainstream.
He acquired a loyal following and received some admiring reviews, but in the ensuing years the popularity of more modern styles threatened to confine him to obscurity. He returned to prominence in the 1960's when he toured with the Newport All Stars, a group led by George Wein, the promoter and sometime pianist, who was among his biggest boosters. (Mr. Braff was on the bill at the first Newport Jazz Festival, produced by Mr. Wein in 1954, and he became a regular on Mr. Wein's worldwide festival circuit.)
In 1971 Mr. Braff began a two-year association with Tony Bennett, after which he and Mr. Barnes began touring and recording together extensively. Their quartet disbanded in 1975, but Mr. Braff remained busy as a freelancer, working frequently with the pianist Dick Hyman, the bassist Michael Moore and others.
He is survived by a sister, Susan Atran of Stoughton, Mass.
Throughout his career Mr. Braff had very clear ideas about how jazz should and should not be played, and he was never shy about expressing them.
''Most people play three times louder than they should,'' he said in a 1997 Downbeat interview. ''Music should be played at a conversational level -- you can't shout a conversation.''

Mr. Trump, who has pledged $1 million over four years to match first-time gifts of $10,000 or more from any individual or corporation, will match only donations to the United Way's community fund, over which the United Way has full discretion. If a donor has already made a $10,000 contribution and increases the gift, Mr. Trump will match the increase.
''New York has been great to me,'' Mr. Trump said, ''and this is a great way for me to give back to the city.'' Around tables at gala fund-raising events, Mr. Trump is often criticized for not being generous enough, though it is never said for attribution; charity fund-raising officials are careful never to burn bridges, even ones that do not exist. That caution may prove astute, since Mr. Trump said he intended to step up his philanthropy in the city.
''While I make a lot of charitable contributions, to the Police Athletic League, to the United Cerebral Palsy Foundation, for AIDS research, they're not usually directed to New York,'' he said. ''And I think more of them will be, going forward.''
The challenge grant is a coup for the United Way, which, like most charities, has faced an uphill battle raising money.
''It's tough,'' said Ralph Dickerson Jr., chief executive of the United Way of New York City. ''At this point in the campaign, we're seeing some slight growth, but we're taking some hits, too, because companies are laying people off. It's too early to say.''
Billie Tisch, a United Way of New York City board member, came up with the idea of getting Mr. Trump to issue the challenge. He said he was flattered. ''I think the world of her,'' Mr. Trump said, ''and she and Ralph were so excited about the idea that I got excited, too.''
 TORONTO, Feb. 17 -- Great-West Lifeco, a Canadian insurer, agreed today to acquire Canada Life Financial for 7.3 billion Canadian dollars ($4.7 billion) in cash and stock, trumping an earlier bid by Manulife Financial of Toronto. 
 If completed, the deal would create Canada's biggest insurance company while significantly expanding the interests of the Desmarais family of Montreal, one of Canada's most powerful business dynasties. 
 The Desmarais family controls Great-West through the Power Financial Corporation, which is also the major shareholder in the Investors Group, Canada's leading mutual fund company. 
 Canada Life had rejected Manulife's offer, made on Dec. 9, as inadequate. David A. Nield, Canada Life's chairman and chief executive, said today that his company had conducted a worldwide search for an alternative to Manulife and that Great-West had ``agreed to emerge as our white knight''. 
 The battle for Canada Life, which is based in Toronto, comes on the heels of a series of mergers and acquisitions by Canadian life insurers. 
 The trend has been reinforced in recent years by the demutualization -- the conversion of an insurer to shareholder ownership from policyholder ownership -- of four of the country's five biggest companies, including Manulife and Canada Life. In addition, the Canadian government relaxed ownership restrictions on most insurance companies at the beginning of 2002. 
 Last year, two other demutualized groups merged, with Sun Life Financial of Toronto buying Clarica, based in Waterloo, Ontario, in a stock deal valued at 7.3 billion Canadian dollars, or $4.8 billion at current exchange rates. Great-West Life, the only one of the big five that has not converted, bought London Life in 1997, topping a bid by the Royal Bank of Canada. 
 The recent spate of insurance mergers is expected to increase pressure on the Canadian government to clarify its policy on mergers and takeovers among Canada's banks, which are also seen as potential acquirers or takeover targets of insurers. The authorities have blocked several proposed deals involving the banks over the last five years. Ownership curbs still apply to Sun Life and Manulife. 
 Great-West, which is based in Winnipeg and administers about 98 billion Canadian dollars ($64 billion) in assets, operates mostly in Canada and in the United States, where it has sizable businesses in group life insurance and retirement funding in the nonprofit sector. 
 Almost one-third of Canada Life's assets, totaling 68 billion Canadian dollars ($44.6 billion), are in Britain and Ireland. Analysts have questioned whether either Manulife or Great-West would retain the British businesses in the longer term if they acquired Canada Life. But Raymond L McFeetors, Great-West's chief executive, said today that ``we see a lot of opportunity for growth there''. 
 The Great-West bid is valued at 44.50 Canadian dollars ($29.21) a share in cash, preferred stock and common stock, with cash accounting for a maximum of about 60 percent of the total price. 
 Manulife's offer of cash and stock was initially valued at 6.4 billion Canadian dollars ($4.2 billion) but has subsequently dropped to $6.2 billion Canadian dollars, reflecting Manulife's lower share price. The offer expires on Feb. 28. 
 Timothy Lazaris, an analyst at Griffiths McBurney & Partners, a securities firm in Toronto, said Manulife was unlikely to return to the fray. Canada Life has agreed to pay Great-West a fee equal to 3.95 percent of the purchase price if the deal unravels. 
 Manulife owns 9.1 percent of Canada Life's stock, most of it bought at the time that Canada Life was converted in 1999. Mr. Lazaris estimated that Manulife would make a profit of about 300 million Canadian dollars by selling its shares to Great-West.

A cosmopolitan victory ended the American Contract Bridge League's Spring Nationals in Philadelphia on Sunday.
Five players who made a mark at the World Championships in Montreal last August snatched the title in the Open Swiss Team Championship. They were Christal Henner-Welland of Manhattan, Peter Bertheau and Frederick Nystrom, who all finished with bronze medals in the prestigious Rosenblum teams there, linked with Claudio Nunes and Fulvio Fantoni of Italy, who were the winners of the World Pairs title. Their sixth was Fred Gitelman of Las Vegas, who has had many successes representing Canada.
The Henner-Welland team was third going into the final match, but a big victory allowed its members to jump to the top of the standings. Second was a team led by Eddie Wold of Houston that included the only octogenarian to play regularly at the highest levels: 86-year-old George Rosenkranz of Mexico City.
On the diagramed deal Henner-Welland brought home a tricky three no-trump contract. A spade was led, giving her no help, and she allowed East to win with the queen. She won the next spade lead with dummy's king and led a heart, relieved that East had not shifted to a club. That player now tried the king, trying to confuse the issue, but it made no difference. South won with the ace and surrendered a heart to the jack.
Another spade lead went to South's ace, and when she played a third heart, West was able to win with the queen and cash the last spade. The next lead from West was due to give South a trick in one of the minor suits, but unfortunately for South she had to make an awkward discard on the spade winner.
She chose a diamond, and West was able to lead that suit without immediately giving South her contract. When the jack won, the position was this:
West came under pressure when South led her two heart winners. He did the best he could by discarding the two and 10 of clubs, but South worked out what was happening. West had given away a trick by leading a diamond, and would presumably have preferred to lead a club if he did not have the king of that suit. So Henner-Welland cashed the club ace, collected the king and made her game. She did not gain points, for in the replay South brought home four hearts. West had a difficult lead choice and presumably gave away a trick by leading a minor suit.
Forty years ago this week, the Supreme Court handed down its landmark decision, Gideon v. Wainwright, holding that poor defendants have a constitutional right to a lawyer. That principle is now ingrained in our culture, but the reality is that for many defendants, the promise of Gideon has been hollow. Poor people are still imprisoned, and even put to death, after trials in which they have shockingly inadequate legal representation.
The man who gave the Gideon case its name, Clarence Gideon, was sentenced to five years in prison for breaking into a poolroom. This was after a trial in which he was forced to represent himself because he lacked the money to hire a lawyer. In March 1963, the Supreme Court overturned his conviction, holding that his trial violated the 6th and 14th Amendments. ''The right of one charged with crime to counsel may not be deemed fundamental and essential to fair trials in some countries,'' the court wrote, ''but it is in ours.''
Gideon laid out a constitutional principle, but it is up to the states to apply it. Their programs are woefully inadequate. In many of the 22 states that pay for such legal services entirely at the state level, the level of financing is so low that lawyers cannot afford to investigate and prepare proper defenses.
In the 28 states that rely on local financing, the quality of representation is even worse. In some Texas counties, defendants wait months in jail before seeing a lawyer. In Georgia, some counties try indigent defendants in nonfelony cases without providing lawyers, even when a conviction may result in prison time -- a direct violation of Gideon.
The recent spate of exonerations based on DNA tests has demonstrated that inadequate representation can, and does, lead to wrongful convictions. A Montana man, speaking at an Open Society Institute panel this month, told of spending 15 years in prison on a sexual assault charge after a trial in which his court-appointed lawyer did no investigation, hired no experts and failed to file an appeal. After 15 years, he was cleared with DNA evidence.
There is no great mystery about how to provide low-income defendants with appropriate legal representation. The states must ensure that lawyers' caseloads meet accepted standards, and that there are sufficient resources for investigators and expert witnesses. The lawyers who take these cases should, ideally, work for professional defender services. If not, they must get appropriate training and supervision, and there must be a process for removing those who do not perform adequately.
The Supreme Court was right, four decades ago, when it said that the right to counsel is ''fundamental and essential.'' It is time, at last, to make the promise of Gideon a reality.
THEY collect evidence carefully, cultivating sources and assessing their credibility. They survey locations with satellite imagery and painstakingly analyze video clips frame by frame for clues to help them find out who walked away with $1 million.
But these detectives are not investigating a bank robbery or a case of corporate embezzlement. The object of their pursuit is the identity of the million-dollar winner of ''Survivor: The Amazon,'' the CBS reality program.
Even in cases when they are not excited by the program itself, ''Survivor'' gumshoes enjoy the challenge of spoiling the taped show's conclusion before it goes on the air.
''When I saw the first episode, I thought, this is a really terrible show,'' said Stephen Turley, who works at a financial services firm in Baltimore. But once Mr. Turley visited Internet message boards where participants were trying to determine how contestants were faring, he said, ''I was pretty hooked.''
''Survivor,'' for those who have not seen the program, goes something like this: 16 people are taken to a remote location, provided with minimal supplies and divided into two ''tribes.'' The tribes participate in competitions, and the losing tribe has to vote one of its members off the show. Eventually evicted tribe members form a jury that chooses which of the final two contestants wins $1 million. The sixth season of ''Survivor,'' filmed late last year in the Amazon rain forest in northwestern Brazil, is on the air now; previous seasons were filmed in such places as Thailand, Kenya and the Marquesas Islands in French Polynesia.
''Survivor'' is filmed months before it is broadcast, so by the time it reaches American living rooms, contestants and film crews have come and gone. The winner is revealed in a live broadcast of the show, but spoiler sites like Acmebraintrust.com and Survivornews.net thrive on much more than who is going to get the prize money. Each week, there are predictions of who is going to be voted off the show, and ultimately, of who the two finalists will be.
Among the more popular sleuthing techniques at the spoiler sites is collecting tips on contestants' weight loss. Since food in the game is scarce, the more weight ''Survivor'' players lose, the better their chances of winning -- or so the theory goes.
''Weight-loss spoilers, almost all in press stories or posts on message boards by casual acquaintances or co-workers of the contestants, gave away the final five in 'Survivor: Thailand,''' said Jeff Pitman, a research scientist in Providence, R.I., who runs TrueDorkTimes.com, a satirical Web site that attracts ''Survivor'' spoilers. Mr. Pitman said that last year one enterprising spoiler traveled to a car dealership that employed a contestant, Brian Heidik, and took photographs of him. Mr. Heidik appeared fairly emaciated, and it turned out that he had won the game.
In fact, predictions at the sites are sometimes so accurate that reading them can make episodes seem almost like reruns.
For this season, Survivornews.Net, run by Tim Gilman, had a perfect track record as of last week's episode. Acme Braintrust members -- the site, which has about 100 members, is made accessible by invitation only, in part to keep costs down -- have correctly picked four of six evicted tribe members. ''In Survivor 4, we got 15 of 16 picks correct,'' said David Kathman, a stock analyst in Chicago who is a member of the site. ''Survivor 3 was not nearly as good. There wasn't as good information available.'' The various spoiler sites tend to be cooperative and competitive in their quest to reveal which ''Survivor'' players have outwitted, outlasted and outplayed their competitors.
Other hints come straight from CBS: fans record promotions for coming episodes and scan them frame by frame for clues. These ''vidcaps,'' as they are called, recently helped fans correctly predict the specifics of a tribe swap. CBS will neither confirm nor deny its use of red herrings, but some believe that after the first vidcap revelation in the first season, the show's executive producer, Mark Burnett, inserted a digitally altered image into the credits to sidetrack determined spoilers.
''I really have to tip my hat to him -- that was a genius move,'' Mr. Turley said.
Mr. Burnett said he appreciated the interest from spoiler sites. ''It's a natural expression of human nature,'' he said. ''With so much of our show shrouded in secrecy until it's broadcast, it makes complete sense that many individuals consider it a challenge to try to gain information before it's officially revealed -- sort of like a code they are determined to crack.
''While it's my job to keep our fans on their toes and stay one step ahead, it is fascinating to hear some of the lengths these individuals are willing to go.''
For fans of the Web sites, ''the spoiling is the fun part,'' and Mr. Burnett said he did not mind. ''If it keeps them excited and interested in the show, then everybody wins.''
While slimmer contestants and video captures can be informative, sometimes the spoilers' level of detail suggests inside connections. Dan Bollinger, an industrial designer from West Lafayette, Ind., operates Survivor Maps (www.claycritters.com/map/survivormaps.htm), which publishes maps of ''Survivor'' filming locations, based partly on satellite images.
''Our tips come from the people at the location,'' Mr. Bollinger said. ''Government officials, tourism chiefs, resort managers, those sorts of sources. It is hard to hide 300 people.''
But the site does not engage in spoiling. ''We don't investigate the winner,'' he said. ''We'd rather watch and be surprised.''
Deals in which a player has too many trumps are always entertaining, except perhaps for the victim. This example is from the Open Pairs at the Spring Nationals in Philadelphia last month.
The auction shown was common for this hand, with East opening the bidding and South making a weak jump overcall in spades. West passed, the usual tactic with length and strength in the opponent's suit, and made a penalty pass when East reopened with a double.
Since East-West could make game in hearts, scoring at least 420, the defenders needed to take eight tricks against two spades doubled, for a score of 500. It was not easy, and the number of trump tricks taken by West was crucial. The defenders could take two diamonds, one heart and one club, but could they take four trump tricks?
The play often began with two rounds of hearts, the second ruffed by South. Making South ruff proved to be an error. The declarer could then cross to the club ace, ruff a heart and cash the club king. Next he could exit in a minor suit.
The defense could take three minor-suit tricks, but the position would be this with East to lead:
West finds he has too many trumps. If East leads the diamond ace, South discards his club nine. West has to ruff, and South takes two trump tricks at the finish. The declarer has escaped for down two.
For the defense to collect 500 and score well, West needed to shift to diamonds at the second trick. Continuing that suit would permit a quick overruff, and eventually three more trump tricks.
Forty-one years ago, a poor, isolated prisoner in Florida, the least influential of Americans, wrote a letter to the Supreme Court -- a letter in pencil, on lined prison paper -- claiming that he had been wrongly denied the right to a lawyer when he was convicted. The Supreme Court agreed to hear his case and found that the Constitution required counsel to be provided in all serious criminal cases for defendants too poor to hire their own. Clarence Earl Gideon would have a new trial, this time with a lawyer.
The new jury found him not guilty: a happy ending not only for him but also for the principle that a lawyer's help is crucial for criminal defendants.
After the Supreme Court decision, I recognized that it would be, as I wrote then, ''an enormous social task to bring to life the dream of Gideon v. Wainwright -- the dream of a vast, diverse country in which every man charged with crime will be capably defended . . . sure of the support needed to make an adequate defense.'' On this 40th anniversary, how have we done? I take my answer from a recent paper by Bruce Jacob, the lawyer who represented the State of Florida in the Supreme Court, arguing against Gideon's claim of a right to counsel. ''I hoped that legislatures would meet the challenge,'' Jacob wrote. ''That was at a time in my life when I still believed that legislators want to do the right thing. . . . The record of the courts in fulfilling the hopes represented by Gideon is a dismal one.''
I was covering the Supreme Court when it decided Gideon v. Wainright, and the case has always had special meaning for me. It is painful to hear Bruce Jacob express disappointment at today's courtroom inadequacies. Even more alarming is the assertion by the Bush administration that in a whole new class of cases it can deny the right to counsel altogether. Those are the cases of American citizens designated by Bush as ''enemy combatants.'' One of them is Jose Padilla, born in Brooklyn in 1970 and arrested by federal agents last May at O'Hare International Airport in Chicago. The administration claims that it can hold Padilla in solitary confinement indefinitely, without trial and without access to a lawyer.
Bruce Jacob's judgment rests on endless failures to bring the promise of Gideon to life. Many states and localities offer not even the minimal level of financial support needed for an adequate defense. And far too often the lawyers provided for indigent defendants have not met the barest standards of competence. Take the case of the sleeping lawyer. Calvin Burdine was on trial for his life in Texas when his appointed counsel, Joe Frank Cannon, fell asleep several times during the trial. The Texas Court of Criminal Appeals held that that was no reason to set aside Burdine's conviction. The United States Court of Appeals, considering the issue on habeas corpus, disagreed, but only by a vote of 9 to 5. That is, five of those distinguished federal judges thought a lawyer who fell asleep during a capital trial did not do enough harm to matter.
The truth of the proposition that a lawyer is essential was vividly demonstrated to me by something that happened in Gideon's second trial. Gideon had been charged with breaking and entering the Bay Harbor Poolroom in Panama City, Fla., in the early morning hours and taking some coins and wine. At his first trial, a taxi driver, Preston Bray, testified that Gideon had telephoned him and that he had gone to the poolroom and picked him up. When he got into the cab, Bray said, Gideon told him not to tell anyone about it. That was damaging testimony. And Gideon, without a lawyer, let it stand without any cross-examination.
In the second trial, Gideon had a lawyer: Fred Turner. After Preston Bray testified again that Gideon had told him not to say anything about picking him up that morning, Turner asked whether Gideon had ever said that to him before. The taxi driver answered, yes, Gideon said that every time he called a cab. ''Why?'' ''I understand it was his wife -- he had trouble with his wife.''
Nothing could demonstrate more clearly the value of having a lawyer. But we know now that it has to be a competent lawyer. Fred Turner was competent, and then some. He not only destroyed the taxi driver's evidence against Gideon. He destroyed the chief prosecution witness, one Henry Cook, who said he had seen Gideon near the time of the break-in. Turner suggested to the jury that it was really Cook himself who had committed the crime. He was in a good position to speak about Cook because he had represented Cook in two other cases.
Lawyers themselves bear some of the responsibility for the failures since the Gideon decision. Of the 13 people on death row in Illinois released between 1987 and 2000 after they were found innocent, four had been represented by lawyers who were later disbarred or suspended from practice. But so do the authorities who pick indifferent, sleepy, incompetent lawyers to defend men and women on matters as serious as life and death. Calvin Burdine's lawyer, Joe Frank Cannon, was appointed by judges in Houston to other cases after he slept through Burdine's trial. In Texas and other places, some appointments of counsel are regarded as sinecures to be given to friends and supporters.
Then there is the question of resources. Even a competent lawyer may not be able to mount an adequate defense against the state, with all its resources, if he has next to nothing for investigation and effectively works for starvation wages. Bobby Houston spent 19 months in jail in Indianapolis without ever being tried, four of them after the charge against him, child molesting, had been dismissed. The public defender handling his case never told him, or told the prison authorities, about the dismissal.
We can surely say that Houston's lawyer lacked due diligence. But politics and money were also involved. At the time of the case, public defenders in Marion County, Ind. -- working part time or more than part time -- were paid $20,800 a year, plus $60 a month for all office expenses. They were so grossly underpaid and overworked that many could not even accept collect calls.
Why does the dream of the Gideon decision -- the dream of a country in which every person charged with crime will be capably defended -- remain just that, a dream? Why do judges countenance mockeries of legal representation? Why do we, the citizens, tolerate such unfairness? These are profound questions, and I can do no more than speculate on possible explanations.
One answer is plain. Criminal defendants and prisoners have little or no political power. Legislators see no votes in assigning competent lawyers for poor defendants or giving lawyers the resources to do their job properly. The Clarence Earl Gideons of this world are constituents who can safely be ignored. Many are barred from voting, and the rest seldom bother.
There is more to it than defendants' and prisoners' lack of political power. This country differs from all other Western countries in its attitude toward crime and criminals. We are tough on crime, as the advocates of harsh measures put it. Critics might use a stronger term, like ''brutal.'' American prisons tend to be more unpleasant than they are elsewhere; sentences, much longer. And of course we impose the death penalty, which has been abandoned everywhere else in the trans-Atlantic world as a savage relic. Why the United States takes so different a view of how to treat criminals is a question too deep for exploration here. But there is no doubt that the harsh view exists, exacerbated by politicians, starting with Richard Nixon and his ''war on crime.''
Manifestations of this harshness are widespread. The United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit recently approved the involuntary administration of antipsychotic drugs to a death-row inmate so he could be made sane enough to be executed. Then there was the prosecutor who argued that an execution should proceed even if the prisoner were to offer last-minute DNA evidence of his innocence.
DNA is at the center of an extraordinary recent development that sheds some light on attitudes toward criminal justice. The discovery of incompetence -- or worse -- at the Houston Police crime laboratory in recent months may affect hundreds of prosecutions in Harris County, where Houston is located, including many capital cases. More defendants from Harris County have been executed than from any other county in the United States. Now it turns out that the work of the laboratory is suspect. What about the defense lawyers? Many simply did not have the resources to check the authenticity of the evidence that sent their clients to jail -- or to death.
Among them were the lawyers for Josiah Sutton, convicted of rape four years ago and prosecuted in part on the basis of a DNA report from the Houston lab. After a Houston television station raised questions about the laboratory last fall, the sample used to help convict Sutton was retested by an independent laboratory in Houston, which found that it did not match Sutton's DNA.
The case of Josiah Sutton and the Houston crime lab is one more proof of what Justice Black told us in Gideon: when the state brings its weight down on an individual, he or she cannot get justice without the help -- the effective help -- of a lawyer. That is a fundamental truth, an obvious truth, as Black said. But on the anniversary of the decision in Gideon v. Wainwright, that truth is being challenged in a way that I did not believe was possible in our country.
In two cases now before the courts, Attorney General John Ashcroft is asserting that President Bush has the power to detain any American citizen indefinitely, in solitary confinement, without access to a lawyer, if he, the president, designates the detainee an ''enemy combatant.'' The detainee cannot effectively challenge that designation. A court may hold a habeas corpus proceeding, but the government need produce only its own assertions of evidence, not subject to cross-examination. ''Some evidence'' will suffice -- that is, any evidence, however unchecked and second-hand. That is the claim being made by the law officers of the United States.
I would not have believed that an attorney general would argue that an American could be held indefinitely without being able to speak to a lawyer. I seriously doubt that any attorney general in the years since Gideon, except the present occupant of the office, would have made that claim.
One of the pending cases concerns Jose Padilla, who became a gang member, was arrested half a dozen times and served several jail sentences. He became a Muslim. After traveling, in Pakistan among other places, Padilla flew into O'Hare Airport last May 8 and was arrested by federal agents. He was first detained as a material witness before a New York federal grand jury investigating the Sept. 11 terrorist attack on the World Trade Center. A judge appointed a lawyer for him and set a hearing for June 11. But on June 10 Ashcroft, who happened to be in Moscow, made a televised statement about Padilla. ''We have captured a known terrorist,'' Ashcroft said. His arrest ''disrupted an unfolding terrorist plot to attack the United States by exploding a radioactive 'dirty bomb.''' There has been no way for Padilla, or his lawyer, to challenge that statement, or for the news media to test its truth. It was a conviction by government announcement.
Padilla is confined in a Navy brig in South Carolina. The lawyer originally appointed to represent him in the material witness proceeding, Donna R. Newman, has been trying to see him -- without success. A federal judge, Michael Mukasey, decided that she should have a chance to talk with him for the limited purpose of examining the evidence produced by the government in support of his designation as an ''enemy combatant.'' But that decision was challenged anew by government lawyers.
They offered an affidavit by the director of the Defense Intelligence Agency, Vice Adm. Lowell E. Jacoby. He said successful interrogation of a prisoner depends largely on ''creating an atmosphere of dependency and trust between the subject and interrogator. Developing the kind of relationship . . . necessary for effective interrogations . . . can take a significant amount of time. There are numerous examples of situations where interrogators have been unable to obtain valuable intelligence from a subject until months, or even years, after the interrogation process began.'' Admiral Jacoby said any access to counsel, however brief, ''can undo months of work and may permanently shut down the interrogation process.''
There is a certain paradox in Admiral Jacoby's affidavit. The very fact that extended interrogation in the absence of counsel may break a subject's will is one reason that the right to counsel is guaranteed in the criminal law. It is the basis of the Miranda rule.
The government argues, and in the other ''enemy combatant'' case the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit agreed, that the Sixth Amendment's guarantee of the right to counsel ''in all criminal prosecutions'' does not apply because Padilla is not being prosecuted. In other words, the government can hold an American in prison for life without letting him see a lawyer if it takes care not to charge him with a crime and try him. James Madison and the others who added the Sixth Amendment and the rest of the Bill of Rights to the Constitution in 1791 would surely have regarded that argument as sophistry.
Bruce Jacob has served on both the defense and the prosecution side of criminal justice. Forty years after Gideon v. Wainwright was decided, he takes a broad view of the constitutional right to counsel. It should include civil as well as criminal proceedings, he says in his paper: ''The due process and equal protection clauses do not differentiate between criminal and civil cases.'' Paraphrasing Black's opinion, Jacob concludes: ''Certainly any person haled into court or brought before any tribunal, whether criminal, civil or administrative. . . should, if indigent, be afforded counsel at public expense.'' With an eye on the enemy combatant cases, I would amend that statement to include any person deprived of his liberty by the state.
Clarence Earl Gideon was not a clear thinker, a man of the world or, least of all, an easy person to deal with. He was a petty criminal, a habitual one, worn out beyond his years by a difficult life. But he knew what he wanted. He turned down the first two lawyers offered him, when it came time for his second trial. He wanted Fred Turner, and that was a wise choice.
Fred Turner told Bruce Jacob that Gideon came to him with ''a valise full of motions.'' Among other things, he wanted to move for a change of venue, to Tallahassee. Turner pointed out that he knew people in Panama City -- in fact, he knew most of the jurors -- but none in Tallahassee. Gideon agreed to drop the idea of a change of venue. Then Turner told him, ''I'll only represent you if you will stop trying to be the lawyer and let me handle the case.'' Gideon agreed.
Clarence Gideon, who died in 1972, would be disappointed today at the imperfect realization of his dream. He would regret especially, I think, the failure of the Supreme Court to hold that the Constitution requires a meaningfully competent lawyer for the poor defendant -- the court's countenancing, even in capital cases, of lawyers who scarcely go through the motions while their clients are convicted.
On the other hand, the Supreme Court has held fast to the principle that the right to consult a lawyer is, as Justice Black said, ''fundamental.'' It is a far more conservative court than the one that decided the Gideon case, with William Rehnquist as chief justice instead of Earl Warren. It has overruled or narrowed many precedents. But it has repeatedly reaffirmed its holding in Gideon v. Wainwright.
That is what makes the Bush administration's claim in the ''enemy combatant'' cases so extraordinary. Of course, Jose Padilla and the other man being held, Yasser Esam Hamdi, are not in precisely Gideon's position. They are not being prosecuted; they are being held indefinitely, without charges, in solitary confinement. They are not looking for counsel; they both already have lawyers, highly competent ones appointed by federal judges. But they are not allowed to talk to them. Those differences from Gideon's situation seem to make their need to consult the lawyers they have, if anything, more compelling.
The constitutional argument made by Ashcroft and his aides also seems imperfect. Perhaps the Sixth Amendment guarantee of counsel ''in all criminal prosecutions'' can be reasoned away as inapplicable to indefinite detention without charge, though I think the framers would have been astonished at the invention of a severe penalty for a suspect with fewer rights than he would have as a criminal defendant.
But the Constitution also includes the Fifth Amendment. It provides that ''no person shall . . . be deprived of life, liberty or property, without due process of law.'' Jose Padilla has been deprived of his liberty -- forever, for all he knows. Has he had due process of law?
The Bush administration's answer to that question is essentially this: in a war against terrorism, any process that the president says is essential to the war is due process. Government lawyers argue that in wartime, courts must defer to the president's judgment.
The denial of counsel to Jose Padilla, then, is an aspect of something larger. About the time the Gideon case was decided, we began to hear about the imperial presidency. The terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, and now the war on Iraq have renewed that concept in even more extreme form. Bush has little trouble with a supine Congress. He wants the Constitution, too, as our judges enforce it, to yield to the supremacy of the president.
It looked like a colorized newsreel from the Depression: panicky depositors lining up outside a bank, convinced it was about to fail, demanding dollars they had entrusted to savings accounts and keepsakes they had put in safe deposit boxes. They seemed to expect the tellers to say the cash drawers were empty, the vault bare.
Added to that was a 21st-century fear. In this crowd, some customers were apparently so concerned about the possibility of severe acute respiratory syndrome, or SARS, that they arrived wearing surgical masks. Others pulled their shirts, soggy from standing in a crowd on a warm afternoon, over their faces.
Officials of the bank -- the Abacus Federal Savings Bank -- said the depositors' financial fears were unfounded. The officials said that Abacus, whose name in Chinese includes two characters that translate as ''national treasure,'' was not in trouble, it was just that they had fired the manager of one of the bank's six branches after concluding that she had embezzled more than $1 million.
But depositors who read an article in a Chinese newspaper or heard reports on a Chinese-language radio station yesterday converged on three branches -- two in Chinatown, including the one at Canal and Mott Streets that had been run by the fired manager, Carol Lim, and one in Sunset Park, Brooklyn.
''My mother was going to work and saw everyone at the bank and she went in to take out all our money,'' a 13-year-old boy who gave his name only as Victor explained as he waited outside the Sunset Park branch. Citing safety concerns and the size of the crowd, the police ordered bank officials to stop letting people in several hours before closing time.
The tellers inside kept working. And after Victor's mother finally reached the head of the line at the teller's window and made her withdrawal, he said: ''She's happy. She got the money.''
The bank's founder, Thomas Sung, said that cash would be diverted from the bank's other branches to cover withdrawals. And a federal banking regulator said the dismissal of the manager was no cause for a run.
''Should these people be concerned? No,'' said the official, Richard Riccobono, the deputy director of the Office of Thrift Supervision, the independent bureau of Treasury Department responsible for monitoring federally chartered savings banks.
For one thing, he said, Abacus is federally insured, so every depositor would be insured up to $100,000 were the bank to fail.
For another, he said his agency had recently concluded its annual examination of Abacus and found the bank to be financially sound. Abacus had assets of $282.7 million on Dec. 31, up from $245.2 million at the end of 2001. The bank added 13 employees last year, bringing its staff to 158 at the six branches.
But while depositors worried about getting their hands on their cash, Mr. Riccobono said he was more concerned that other people -- robbers -- would get their hands on it once the depositors left the bank. ''You're an easy mark,'' he said. ''No doubt you're being watched. You walk out with a bag'' containing a large amount of cash, ''I bet you're not going to get very far.''
Yesterday, though, the crowds of suspicious depositors had one goal: withdraw the money. Mr. Riccobono said that the bank had given some depositors cash and others a combination of cash and checks to cover what they had had on deposit.
''We saw the people here so we came, too,'' said a customer at the branch at Canal and Mott Streets who would give his name only as Mr. Liang. He said he had lots of money in the bank.
Another person in the line at that branch, Lee Li, said she had also heard about the firing of the manager and was concerned about whether her savings account was safe. ''If I can, I will take it all out,'' she said. ''A lot of people will take their money and not come back to this bank.''
Mr. Sung, who was in Baltimore yesterday, said by cellphone that he was driving to Manhattan to help his employees. ''We will restore every account,'' he said. ''We will not close the bank. We will order more cash, as much as we need.''
He said the bank had placed Ms. Lim, the manager, on a leave of absence in March and had dismissed her on April 13. He said the bank had turned over its records on her activities to the F.B.I. and the United States attorney's office.
Ms. Lim, who lives in Brooklyn, had not been arrested or charged as of last night, but the F.B.I. was investigating. Efforts to reach her by telephone were unsuccessful.
On Mr. Sung's orders, fliers in Chinese and English were distributed to the crowd explaining about Ms. Lim and trying to reassure customers that all accounts were insured.
But the fliers seemed to create more confusion by explaining that one of the things the bank found she had done was to set up fake certificates of deposit and savings accounts. Mr. Sung said that she had also taken deposits without recording them.
What began as a handful of concerned customers in midmorning had turned into a frenzy by lunchtime.
Inside Ms. Lim's old branch at about 1 p.m., things were hectic. Deposit slips littered the floor, phones rang unanswered and the 100 or so customers who had made it inside were lined up at the teller's windows, waiting to withdraw their money.
Getting outside proved a challenge.
From 1 p.m. until the bank closed at 4 p.m. -- 30 minutes later than scheduled -- police officers guarded the doors and opened them only reluctantly.
It was obvious why; whenever the doors opened, the crowd would surge forward. The half-dozen officers at each doorway, vastly outnumbered, would move them back. Several elderly people fainted.
''I almost passed out,'' said John Lin, who left the bank when it closed at 4 p.m. ''People are scared here.''
Walter Fuller, a jazz trumpeter who was believed to be the last surviving member of the band of Earl Hines and who pushed for civil rights on the San Diego jazz scene in the 1940's, died here on April 20. He was 93.
Born in Dyersburg, Tenn., Mr. Fuller grew up in Chicago and was influenced by Louis Armstrong. He joined Hines in 1930 and was credited with helping form the band's sound. He sang and scatted on the band's 1933 hit ''Rosetta,'' which became his signature tune and nickname.
When Hines disbanded the orchestra in 1940, Mr. Fuller started his own big band.
He started playing in San Diego in the mid-1940's with a one-month engagement at the Club Royal; he stayed at the club for a dozen years.
He protested the club's policy of requiring black customers to stand in the rear of the building, even if seats were available in front. After threatening to fire him, the club's managers allowed all customers to sit wherever they wanted.
Mr. Fuller managed to change the listings in the local musicians union chapter, which had separated whites and blacks. In 1952 he became the first black director on the local board of the union.
His survivors include his daughter, Rosetta Fuller of San Diego; two grandchildren; two great-grandchildren; and one great-great-grandchild.
The underpinnings of a free democracy include equal rights under the law. Gideon v. Wainwright recognized that the premise is illusory absent competent legal counsel to represent the indigent imprisoned. The degeneration from Gideon to Padilla shows that this is true whether a detainee is called ''defendant'' or ''enemy combatant.'' Our Constitution, and the principles it embodies, are served by protecting the rights of all, not by a political nomenclature game.

I find it odd that the Bush administration, led by a self-proclaimed compassionate conservative and Christian, is trying so hard to undermine the precedent of Gideon v. Wainwright. As Anthony Lewis points out, Clarence Earl Gideon, and indigent defendants like him, are ''the least influential of Americans.'' Did not Jesus say, ''Inasmuch as ye did it not to one of the least of these, ye did it not to me'' (Matthew 25:45)?
David Snyder

Anthony Lewis seems the epitome of a New Age liberal who ignores the reality of our highly dangerous world (April 20). In an ideal world, there would be no Islamic militants whose sole purpose in life is to kill as many Americans as they can. Lewis should recognize that our world changed forever on Sept. 11, 2001, and that even Jefferson, Adams and Franklin would have recognized that the first obligation of a free nation is to defend itself from those who would gladly die in flames to provoke mass destruction of American innocents.

The first thing that travelers from New York see of the Garden State is not a garden at all but a swampy mosquito-breeding wasteland known, counterintuitively, as the Hackensack Meadowlands. Now, however, under a plan being cobbled together by environmentalists, business leaders and state and local officials, New Jersey's worst eyesore -- which comes into view just west of the railroad tunnels -- may one day become a watery ecological preserve covering 8,400 acres of protected wetlands, wildlife refuges, hiking trails, playing fields and even a golf course or two.
Conservationists have long dreamed of restoring an area that for years attracted only dump trucks and gangsters in search of a resting place for their rivals. But it was only a dream until February, when a Virginia-based developer specializing in megamalls agreed to take a planned retail and entertainment complex elsewhere. The developers owned 600 strategically located acres, 200 of which would have been drained and filled to accommodate the mall. As as long as that project remained on the drawing boards, the larger destiny of the Meadowlands could not be resolved.
There were many important players in this drama, among them the environmentalists, who first argued the ecological case for the Meadowlands; the Clinton administration, which intervened at a critical moment to delay development; and Steve Rothman, a member of Congress who helped secure money to buy land. Donald DiFrancesco, then New Jersey's acting governor, was the first chief executive to speak out against the mall. The current governor, James McGreevey, tilted the leadership of the state agency that oversees zoning in the Meadowlands toward conservation and away from development.
It will take an enormous amount of energy and money to make the Meadowlands fit for human enjoyment, not to mention a more productive environment for the 260 bird species that feed and breed there. For starters, it will mean cleaning up a polluted landscape that once was host to as many as 300 active landfills and took in 11,000 tons of trash every day from New York City and northern New Jersey. But it is worth the effort. From the beginning of this fight it has been clear that the New York metropolitan area needs open space far more than it needs another shopping mall.
P.J. Carlesimo leaned against a wall outside the visitors' locker room at the Staples Center in Los Angeles last week, a bit unclear how the pendulum had swung this far west.
''I don't know exactly how it evolved,'' Carlesimo, an assistant coach for the San Antonio Spurs, said. Referring to elite players in the Western Conference like Shaquille O'Neal, Kobe Bryant, Tim Duncan and Chris Webber, he said: ''Shaq and Kobe end up out here, of course. Timmy gets drafted by the Spurs. C-Webb is out here, traded from Washington. Then you start naming the good international guys. Steve Nash, Peja Stojakovic, Dirk Nowitzki.''
''It's as simple as this,'' Carlesimo said, with sudden clarity, ''We have more of the top players and because of that we have more of the top teams.''
Poor Jason Kidd. Pity Ben Wallace and his team, too. The Nets and the Detroit Pistons spent the last eight months proving they were unworthy not only of a conference title but also of an N.B.A. championship.
Many of their peers and the game's coaches do not have the heart to tell them what they really think: that they still have no shot, that the Eastern Conference finals have become one of those annual exercises in futility, the equivalent of passing a bill everyone knows will be vetoed. Winning the East these days is geared more toward fan appreciation and filling a franchise's coffers, not toward a dress rehearsal for a title. With the three-time champion Lakers dethroned and Webber's knee injury in the playoffs undoing Sacramento's bid, the idea of an Eastern team winning a title for the first time since Michael Jordan's last Chicago team in 1998 has gained some currency. After all, the thinking goes, the Spurs are good but hardly invincible. And the Dallas Mavericks -- their counterparts in the Western Conference finals beginning tonight in San Antonio -- have that crazy open-court and defenseless game that could play right into the Nets' hands.
Bigger reaches exist in sports, and it is not as if Duncan, O'Neal, Bryant and Kevin Garnett -- all first-team all-N.B.A. players -- can suit up together to fend off their Eastern counterparts. But the East has won four games in the last four N.B.A. finals, starting with San Antonio's five-game romp over the Knicks in 1999, when the Spurs won their first title.
And if a favored San Antonio club, bigger and deeper than any team in the East, advances again, it still does not look promising for Kidd or Wallace and their teammates.
To find true power rankings in the playoffs, Bob Salmi, a Washington Wizards assistant, recently suggested flipping the brackets; the No. 1 team in the East would face No. 8 in the West, and so on.
''The 4-5 matchup would have been Sixers versus Lakers,'' Salmi said. ''You think the Sixers get out of the first round? When you look at the playoffs in that fashion, it becomes obvious.''
Salmi added that a player like the Detroit rookie Tayshaun Prince would probably not see playing time in the Western Conference playoffs.
''What did he get, 147 minutes of playing time during the regular season, and now he's a dominating factor in the second round of the playoffs?'' he said. ''Prince was vital to the Pistons because they needed him to be vital.''
Over time, the N.B.A. has been as cyclical as any up-and-down franchise. But since the Bulls disbanded and the Knicks' decade-long contender status ended, it has been rough going for the East, which boasts a disturbingly small portion of the league's most gifted players.
How and when did it begin? Easy. Blame Jerry West. He is the former Lakers general manager, now in Memphis, who within weeks in the summer of 1996 orchestrated the free-agent signing of O'Neal and the selection of Bryant through a draft-day maneuver.
In the summer of 1997, the Boston Celtics and their new president, Rick Pitino, had the best chance of winning the N.B.A. draft lottery. But San Antonio got the Ping-Pong ball it needed, plucking Duncan with the No. 1 pick.
In 1998, the Wizards sent Webber to Sacramento for Mitch Richmond. On draft day the same year, Nowitzki was shipped from Milwaukee to Dallas.
Within two years, with the exception of Kidd, Allen Iverson and Tracy McGrady, a majority of the N.B.A.'s marquee players were playing in the Western Conference. When Patrick Ewing's production waned before his retirement and Alonzo Mourning learned he had a career-threatening kidney ailment, all of the league's indomitable big men were suddenly in the West.
''Looking back, it was pretty much Shaquille O'Neal -- shifting the best player in the league from one conference to the other shifts the balance of power,'' Salmi said. ''When he was in the East, teams tried to match up by getting a Dikembe Mutombo. Teams changed their lineups to get someone to stop Shaq.''
The chance to play alongside O'Neal, Webber or Duncan also became an enticement for aging players looking to prolong their careers.
''At one point the East was so dominant, and then the West got the players,'' said Robert Horry, who has been part of five championship teams. ''There were a couple reasons everyone started coming, beyond the money. A lot of guys just want to be on the West Coast because of the free style of play.
''You look at the East. Indiana tried to play like that for a second, then they went back to bump and grind. Boston tried to play it with their scout defense. But the only team in the East that really plays like that is Jersey, with their open offense and a lot of guys cutting. And that's because of Kidd. And he and the coach are from the West Coast.''
Horry came up with another, more basic reason: more hospitable weather. ''Being from Alabama, I'm not a snow guy,'' he said. ''I was traded to Detroit for three days and I was miserable.''
Brian Shaw, the veteran guard, said: ''I know it sounds simple, but it's true. It's easier to get loose in warm-ups out here. You don't have to worry about the gym being cold and your joints being stiff when you wake up.''
The increasing popularity of around-the-clock sports highlight shows has taken some of the edge off league concerns that the West's dominance would hurt interest in the game. Many of the N.B.A.'s oldest and most passionate fans still live in the Northeast, in and around cities like Boston, New York and Philadelphia. And when the league's best players do not finish their games until 1 a.m. their time, some of the most influential news media outlets in the country can barely get their scores in the paper. Now there is a more basic concern: with the N.B.A.'s best players dueling in one star-studded conference, is the casual fan genuinely paying attention to Eastern Conference basketball?
An educated guess: Until someone not named Jordan wins a title, probably not.
Dirk Nowitzki traveled 274 miles downstate for a wild game of Texas Hold 'Em on Tim Duncan's porch. When the two best players left standing in the West had anted up and raised each other, they finally showed their hands.
Duncan had a full house, 18,997 frenzied people at the SBC Center who watched the league's most valuable player put on a virtuoso, 40-point performance in Game 1 of the Western Conference finals.
Nowitzki did him one better. He only had a flush -- a nasty, driving baseline dunk with twp minutes left brought the Dallas Mavericks within 1 -- but he had a wild card. Michael Finley was isolated against Stephen Jackson with 14 seconds remaining and drove by him for the game-winning layup.
After a Duncan miss in the key, Nowitzki hit two free throws and the Mavericks had an improbable 113-110 victory.
The Mavericks made an incredible 49 of 50 free throws, a team record, while the Spurs missed 17 of 48.
Nowitzki led the Mavericks with 38 points and 16 rebounds.
''They took the crowd out a little bit in the first half and they kept coming at us,'' Duncan said.
Duncan's line of 40 points, 15 rebounds and 7 assists was impressive, but not enough to quell a resilient team that rebounded from an 18-point first-half deficit and from 14 points back with 8 minutes 5 seconds remaining.
Game 2 is Wednesday night here and passions should run even higher.
The game took an ugly turn in the final five minutes when Eduardo Najera inadvertently kneed Malik Rose in the back of the head under the Dallas basket.
Najera struggled back up and made it to the other end, but Rose lay there, unable to move.
Neither team elected to use a timeout, so after a San Antonio basket, Dallas Coach Don Nelson implored his team to push the ball, going 5 on 4 against the Spurs without Rose. Nowitzki ended up getting fouled, stepping on the injured Rose in the process.
The move ticked off San Antonio fans, most of whom clearly viewed Nelson as a poor sport for not stopping play -- though his decision was clearly within the rules. They began chanting derisively at him while Rose was attended to, and at one point several objects came onto the floor, including a coin that bloodied the forehead of a scorekeeper.
The game was all San Antonio's with about 10 minutes remaining, as they built a 10-point lead. Manu Ginobili penetrated the left side with 9:30 left, making the defense chase him and forget Duncan, who caught the ball and dunked with malice.
But Dallas kept coming. Finley finished with 26 points in 47 minutes.
For most of two quarters, Duncan and the Spurs gave credence to the idea that the N.B.A. title was decided in the second round of the playoffs, when the league's most valuable player and his hungry teammates stunned the three-time defending champion Los Angeles Lakers in six games.
The Mavericks were being run off the SBC Center floor, beaten at their own fuel-injected game.
Yet with 3:34 left in the third quarter, Finley hit two free throws to tie the score. Nowitzki picked up his fourth foul with less than two minutes left in the third quarter, but even that did not deter Dallas, which took everything the Spurs threw at it in the first half and still managed to stay in the game.
Duncan had one of those halves of which players dream. Almost robotically efficient, he poured in 26 points, hit 9 of 12 shots, 8 of 11 free throws and grabbed 9 rebounds.
For much of the half, Nelson tried everything to stop Duncan. Man-to-man. Zone. Shawn Bradley. Eduardo Najera. He even broke out a playbook oldie with his team down double digits in the second quarter.
Nelson, who has often infuriated opposing coaches with his tactics, decided to intentionally foul Spurs guard Bruce Bowen in the last five minutes of the first half. A 60 percent shooter from the foul line who did not make a free throw in April until the last week of the month, Bowen became the latest target of the Hack-a-Shaq defense.
The strategy used to involve beating on Shaquille O'Neal and forcing the All-Star Laker center to go to the line -- his admitted kryptonite. But now it is employed to put shooting guards inaccurate from 15 feet on the line -- the Bruise-a-Bruce.
The stop-the-clock move worked on a few possessions, but Bowen eventually made three of his last four, and five of 10 free throws altogether in the quarter. He made a 3-pointer along the right baseline in the final minute, but the Mavericks had sawed an 18-point lead in half by intermission.
San Antonio did everything they could to neutralize the impact of Van Exel, who against Sacramento averaged 25.3 points over seven games -- one of the most prolific performances by a reserve in league playoff history.
Bowen pushed his abdomen into Van Exel's, Speedy Claxton chased him around as best he could.
Van Exel finished with 14 points on 3 of 12 shooting. It did not matter, especially with Nowitzki and Finley and Nash (22 points) combining for 86 points.
One of the most coveted titles in the New York metropolitan area is the Grand National Teams, because the winners advance to the national playoffs. Four players won the final at Honors on Wednesday night, earning the right to represent New York in Long Beach, Calif., in July.
They were Brian Glubok, Joe Grue, James Rosenbloom and Fred Chang. Two of them have outstanding records in the event: Glubok has won seven times in nine attempts, and Chang five times in six. Rosenbloom was a semifinalist in the Rosenblum World Team Championship in Montreal last August, and Grue won the World Junior Team title in 2001. John Kranyak, another world junior champion, was unable to play in Wednesday's final but will rejoin the team in Long Beach, perhaps with a sixth player.
Opposing the Glubok team in the final were an even more experienced team: Roy Welland, Christal Henner-Welland, Robert Levin, Steve Weinstein and Bjorn Fallenius. Levin and Weinstein are one of the world's best partnerships, with many titles, and Henner-Welland was in the world team semifinal last August, playing with Rosenbloom.
Glubok surged into a 40 imp lead in the first quarter, but the lead was down to 20 with one quarter remaining. He held on to win by 23, thanks in part to the diagramed deal.
Glubok, South, and Grue, North, were using a special device borrowed from Nick Nickell. A two-club response to one diamond is difficult to handle in standard methods, and two diamonds artificially showed extra values here, guaranteeing game. Other bids would have been nonforcing with minimum hands.
The subsequent bidding was natural. Glubok eventually plunged into six diamonds, relying on the internal strength of his suit, rather than try six spades, which might have suffered from a spade weakness.
West led the heart queen, which was ruffed in the closed hand. The slam had excellent chances, needing a 3-2 club split with a backup situation in spades. South began by driving out the diamond ace. Since East held up until the third round, he had to discard carefully from the dummy. He gave up one club, two spades and one heart, preserving various options. He ruffed East's heart return and drew trumps.
Next he played the king and ace of clubs, and was relieved when both defenders followed suit. He ruffed a club with his last trump and claimed the slam. If the clubs had divided badly, he would have had to solve the spade problem.
In the replay, North-South rested cautiously in five diamonds. East doubled this unwisely, but the Glubok team still gained 9 imps en route to victory.
A Manhattan judge yesterday ordered Donald J. Trump to sell his 50 percent share of the $1 billion General Motors Building in Manhattan to the bankrupt Indiana-based insurance and financial services company Conseco Inc.
Justice Karla Moscowitz of State Supreme Court affirmed the May 28 ruling of an arbitration panel and rejected a request by Mr. Trump's lawyer to throw it out. The judge said she lacked the legal authority to void the panel's 2-1 decision because the panel had not shown a disregard for the law.
The panel ruled that Trump should relinquish his stake in the 50-story skyscraper, which is at Fifth Avenue and 59th Street across from Central Park, for $15.6 million. The panel said Trump had not followed through on his earlier agreement to buy Conseco's share.
Conseco and Mr. Trump bought the building jointly in 1998 for $878 million. Conseco put up $211 million, and Mr. Trump paid $11 million.
Conseco's real estate expert testified that the G.M. Building was now worth about $1.05 billion. The $15.6 million fixed by the arbitrators represents Mr. Trump's proportional share, accounting for the building's increased value.
Donald J. Trump and an Indiana insurance and financial services company announced yesterday that they had settled their long-running feud over control of the General Motors Building in Manhattan and would immediately put the 50-story marble skyscraper up for sale.
The building, which commands some of the highest office rents in Manhattan, is expected to sell for more than $1 billion.
The announcement by Mr. Trump and the insurance company, Conseco Inc., came only one day after Justice Karla Moskowitz of State Supreme Court upheld an arbitration ruling ordering Mr. Trump to sell his 50 percent stake in the property for $15.6 million. After the announcement, Mr. Trump and the company began cobbling together an agreement.
Conseco, which is bankrupt, has wanted to sell the landmark tower and use its share of the proceeds for its recovery plan. The company was in the United States Bankruptcy Court in Chicago yesterday seeking approval of its plan to emerge from bankruptcy.
''We are pleased that we've been able to resolve our remaining differences with the Trump organization and avoid delays in monetizing the value of our investment,'' William J. Shea, chief executive of Conseco, said in a statement released last night.
Mr. Trump also expressed satisfaction with the settlement, whose terms were not made public.
''It's a great asset, and I'll be very sorry to see it go,'' he said. ''But it's been a great transaction for Conseco and myself.''
Eastdil Realty has been hired to market the building. The proceeds of the sale will go to pay off a $700 million mortgage and be split, with Conseco getting $211 million and Mr. Trump $15.6 million, according to two people who were briefed on the settlement. Conseco will get most of any remaining proceeds, with a more modest sum going to Mr. Trump.
Mr. Trump had hoped to hang on to the skyscraper.
He and Conseco came together in May 1998, when bidding was well under way for the tower. Mr. Trump called Stephen Hilbert, then the chairman of Conseco, suggesting that they join forces. The two men outbid the real estate tycoons Steven Roth, Samuel Zell and Marvin Davis with a last-minute offer of more than $800 million.
Mr. Trump put up $11 million for a half stake in the property, and Mr. Hilbert guaranteed $200 million in financing from Lehman Brothers and put up $211 million in cash and loans.
By late 2000, Conseco was in deep financial trouble and Mr. Hilbert had departed. The next year, Mr. Trump agreed to buy out Conseco's stake for $295 million. But the deal foundered.
Frank Wess and Joe Wilder, two elegant, well-liked men who have not been established by jazz history as rule-breaking geniuses, indefatigable bandleaders or makers of holy recorded artifacts, got part of what's due them on Tuesday night. The first big concert of this year's JVC Jazz Festival, at the Kaye Playhouse, was devoted to them, and both musicians -- born within seven weeks of each other in 1922 -- played beautifully in sympathetic surroundings.
Mr. Wilder, a trumpeter who played with big bands in the 40's and 50's and finally went full time into studio and television work, plays a kind of tabula-rasa swing language: there's very little slang in there to clog the music. Several of his friends, guest musicians for the evening, made remarks about his reliability and correctness in all things. ''He's the only man in the music business who I'd let hold my wallet,'' said the trumpeter Warren Vaché. The saxophonist Jimmy Heath testified that ''he and Hank Jones are the only jazz musicians I know who would wear a tie to the supermarket.''
He played in all kinds of situations on Tuesday night: duets, quartets, all-men-on-deck bonanzas with round-robin soloing. With Mr. Vaché and the pianist Bill Charlap's trio, Mr. Wilder played a ballad, ''For Me There's No One but You,'' and it was a high point: he turned in a beautifully disciplined solo, basically long-tones connected by elegant little three- and four-note patterns. He made his playing simple, without slurring or double-timing.
Mr. Wess -- who is similar to Mr. Wilder but with a formative stretch during the 50's and early 60's as a tenor saxophonist in Count Basie's band -- is slier. That was driven home on the closing piece, ''Lester Leaps In.'' Mr. Wilder soloed first, and proved himself on some fast bop figures; it wasn't overdone, but it came off a bit academic.
Mr. Wess followed, playing a complex improvisation that appeared to weigh its options from beginning to end. First he relaxed into the old-fashioned tenor saxophone sound that is in such short supply today: deep, jaunty and authoritative. But then he made several rabbity changes of focus, leaning into saucy, barbed honking and leaving a few gaping rests before he thoughtfully worked his way back into the music.
Various musicians turned in performances at the top of their game, and there was a lot of good improvised counterpoint. The trumpeters Roy Hargrove and Jon Faddis blasted through Basie's ''Midgets''; Mr. Faddis tempered his usual blitzkrieg of high notes with a remarkable, floating approach to time.
Mr. Charlap got off the most concise -- and the most breathtaking -- few minutes of the evening, in his trio's performance of Stephen Sondheim's ''Uptown, Downtown.'' (No, I had never heard jazz musicians play that, either.) The saxophonists Antonio Hart and Phil Woods, the trombonist Benny Powell, and the saxophonist Jimmy Heath all paid respect by playing hard, focused stuff.
To the Editor:
The Bush administration's politically motivated ''editing'' of the Environmental Protection Agency report on global warming (front page, June 19) ought to worry all Americans, whether liberal or conservative. This is another example of the top-down methodology used by members of the administration, in which they first decide on the conclusions they want and then set down to work on providing evidence for them, no matter how flimsy or inaccurate.
When political forces influence scientific inquiry, the result is a misinformed public and a government that fails in its obligation to uphold the public interest.

The report that the Environmental Protection Agency has omitted data on climate change in its ''comprehensive review'' is extremely disturbing (front page, June 19). Climate change is a scientific, not political, issue. The facts are clear. Since the beginning of the Industrial Revolution, carbon dioxide in the atmosphere has risen from 280 to over 360 parts per million as a result of burning fossil fuels. All climate models show that the addition of carbon dioxide to the atmosphere will lead to global warming and changes in precipitation.
Sound governmental policy regarding climate change requires complete, unfettered access to scientific information. Omission of data can lead to policies that endanger the welfare of the nation.

Re ''Censorship on Global Warming'' (editorial, June 20):
The moral integrity of any society is measured, at least in part, by its determination to secure the future for generations that will follow. In this regard, the state of the environment that our children will inherit should be a primary concern.
The Bush administration, however, has exploited the fears resulting from the 9/11 attacks to remove environmental issues from our radar screen. It is the duty of responsible Democrats and Republicans to put these issues back on center stage. Winning the war on terrorism will be pointless unless we are devoting at least as much effort to the war to save the planet.

 "Report by E.P.A. Leaves Out Data on Climate Change" (front page, June 19) says that an Environmental Protection Agency report due next week on the state of the environment is being edited by the White House to play down the risks of global climate change. 
 Having served as E.P.A. administrator under both Presidents Nixon and Ford, I can state categorically that there never was such White House intrusion into the business of the E.P.A. during my tenure. The E.P.A. was established as an independent agency in the executive branch, and so it should remain. There appears today to be a steady erosion in its independent status. 
 I can appreciate the president's interest in not having discordant voices within his administration. But the interest of the American people lies in having full disclosure of the facts, particularly when the issue is one with such potentially enormous damage to the long-term health and economic well-being of all of us.

A new kind of conjured celebrity has overtaken the American pop culture landscape.
Entertainment producers are relying more than ever on high-concept movies, reality television shows and manufactured musical projects, tilting the balance of power away from big-name, big-ticket stars in favor of franchises that mint, rather than require, famous faces.
''2 Fast 2 Furious,'' a star-free, street-racing sequel to ''The Fast and the Furious'' in which the cars outperform the actors, has made more than $100 million in 17 days. Recently, ''Dumb and Dumberer,'' a goof-fest that features two no-names as the younger versions of the nincompoops played by Jim Carrey and Jeff Daniels in the original, almost matched the box office receipts of Harrison Ford's pricey star turn in ''Hollywood Homicide.''
Seven of the top 10 programs in the recently completed television season were reality shows like ''Joe Millionaire'' or procedural dramas like ''C.S.I.'' and ''Law & Order'' that depend on the story, not easily replaced cast members. And Kelly Clarkson, the fresh-faced winner of the first ''American Idol'' popularity contest on Fox, released her album in April just one week before Madonna and has outsold the one-name star by a ratio of more than two to one.
In this plug-and-play entertainment economy, concepts and marketing have become so dominant that performers are increasingly finding themselves treated like one more bit of product placement. Abundant, disposable celebrities and a proliferation of entertainment options on cable, the World Wide Web and game systems have created a cluttered environment where easy-to-understand conceits -- like ''The Bachelor'' and ''X-Men'' -- are needed to break through. As a result, entertainment companies in pursuit of sturdy, long-running franchises are less willing to balance them on something as unpredictable as the popularity of a single star.
''You need concepts that can be easily grasped,'' said Walter Parkes, co-head of motion pictures at DreamWorks SKG, ''that can be described quickly in the schoolyard or at the grocery store checkout. You need urgent word of mouth.''
Of course, celebrities will always endure, as a glimpse of ''Entertainment Tonight'' or US Weekly demonstrates. And being a star can still make for a good day job: Tom Hanks, Tom Cruise, Julia Roberts and Denzel Washington all receive $20 million or more to show up for a movie, while Ray Romano recently signed a $40 million deal for another season of ''Everybody Loves Raymond.''
But a high-priced star is no longer the only answer to the high velocity of today's entertainment world, where people grant the latest film or record release a nanosecond of attention before moving on to the next big thing.
As recently as 1997, the casting for top 10 box office films looked like an A-List party: Leonardo DiCaprio, Ms. Roberts, Mr. Ford, Jack Nicholson, Nicolas Cage and Will Smith were among those who had huge hits. So far this year, cartoons, concepts and sequels like ''Finding Nemo,'' ''2 Fast 2 Furious'' and ''X-Men 2'' rule.
Last weekend ''Hulk,'' Ang Lee's $120 million dark vision of a man battling against both inner and outer demons, opened on Friday on more than 3,600 screens across the country with the relatively unknown Eric Bana in the lead role. It has taken in an estimated $62.6 million so far.
And in the coming TV season, the networks have shown more restraint than usual in handing stars their own shows, after the resounding failures in previous years of shows built around actors like Bette Midler and Richard Dreyfuss.
''A good concept gives you a rifle shot instead of a shotgun when it comes to marketing,'' said Chris McGurk, vice chairman and chief operating officer of Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, the studio that has ridden the last four James Bond movies to gross revenues of $1.5 billion. ''It gets back to simple, iconic messages and characters.''
Studios, seeking to regain the leverage they used to have over those pesky (and unpredictable) stars, are also trying harder to manage celebrity as a fungible commodity. When Tobey Maguire, the star of the successful ''Spider-Man,'' suggested that certain stunts asked of him in the sequel might not be good for his back, the folks at Sony Pictures Entertainment let him know they would be more than happy to cast Jake Gyllenhaal, another bright young actor, in his place, according to Variety.
The parties eventually made up, but the changing balance of power between the studios and the talent was clear.
Todd Garner, a partner in Revolution Studios in charge of movie production, credits the actor Eddie Murphy with a fine performance in ''Daddy Day Care,'' which has already brought in more than $90 million. But, he added, the true magic is in the name of the project, not the name of the actor.
''Eddie's last few movies didn't do that well, but here you have a film and a concept that plays to his strengths,'' Mr. Garner said, referring to films like ''Pluto Nash'' and ''Showtime.''
Concept and star can still work in tandem, as Mr. Carrey's playing God proved in ''Bruce Almighty.''
''There are a handful of legitimate stars who can open movies and fill theaters,'' said James A. Wiatt, president and co-chief executive of the William Morris talent agency. ''And they can make a big special-effects film or a concept film much more successful by their presence.''
But, according to Doug Belgrad, co-president of production at Columbia Pictures, ''Studios are being much more selective about who is a movie star as the investment in production and marketing costs escalate.''
Executives in television have done the same math.
Dick Wolf reinvented the crime genre when he started ''Law & Order.'' Now he has three versions of the franchise, all highly rated, and would like to add a fourth. He says the programs are ''pure concept,'' all cast and recast as he sees fit.
''The play is the thing,'' he said. ''You know, it's a very funny thing, but Hamlet works. As long as the actor is good enough, it doesn't really matter who is in the role. It's the writing. If the writing is good you can replace anybody.''
Jerry Bruckheimer, whose formula of loud, special effects-laden extravaganzas has proved successful in the film world, has engineered a similar work-around on celebrity on television. ''C.S.I.'' -- which follows the crime-solving efforts of a forensic crime lab in Las Vegas -- successfully spun off a Miami-based version this last season. At the same time, he transferred the police procedural motif to another law enforcement unit, the missing persons division of the F.B.I., in ''Without a Trace,'' and this fall, Mr. Bruckheimer will offer ''Cold Case,'' which will investigate long-unsolved crimes.
Indeed, the networks are placing fewer bets on well-known actors for their new shows this fall. Back in 2000, Ms. Midler, Geena Davis, John Goodman, Michael Richards and Gabriel Byrne all had their shows canceled quickly. This season, Alicia Silverstone's and Whoopi Goldberg's new shows effectively begin and end the A-list outings.
As personality-driven comedies have withered on television, reality shows -- which manufacture their own back-stories as they go -- have more than filled the gap.
''It is completely about the story telling,'' said Mark Burnett, the creator of ''Survivor.'' ''It is not about 'The tribe has spoken' or any of that. It's about a concept where the story unfolds.''
If a concept is strong enough, it can manufacture its own appeal across any number of mediums. Ms. Clarkson climbed the slippery pole of fame on ''American Idol,'' then had a top-selling record with significant radio play, and this summer, she and runner-up Justin Guarini will appear in a teenage-friendly movie.
Thomas D. Mottola, the former head of Sony Music Entertainment who discovered Mariah Carey, among other artists, said that combining the ''Idol'' format and the right talent could be like ''igniting gasoline.''
''You could break that artist as the next global superstar,'' said Mr. Mottola, who now runs his own entertainment company. ''The platform in and of itself is enormous in terms of direct marketing.''
Musical stardom has always been a very calculated affair -- Elvis might just have just been another hillbilly if it were not for Col. Tom Parker -- but the music industry is looking for sure things in perilous times. That means stars are conceived as much as discovered.
Clay Aiken, a runner-up on the latest version of ''American Idol'' who has unruly hair and a gee-whiz stage presence, was signed by the music impresario Clive Davis to an RCA deal.
''This Is the Night,'' his just-released CD single, sold nearly 393,000 copies in its first week on sale, the most since Elton John's ''Candle in the Wind'' remake to honor Princess Diana in 1997, according to Nielsen SoundScan.
Celebrity has been defined down to the guy or girl next door, riveting consumers who secretly hope to be the stars of their own movies.
''The wattage of celebrity has cheapened because they are absolutely everywhere,'' said Kim France, editor in chief of Lucky, a shopping magazine that has found success with a celebrity-free formula. ''Its very ubiquity has killed it. An actress has a movie come out, she's on the cover of all sorts of magazines and on all the television shows until you know what kind of hair gel she uses.
''When Madonna first came out,'' she added, ''an interview in Rolling Stone was a thrilling event. A trillion stories later, it doesn't have the same punch.''
Unlike a star, concept has the twin virtues of low maintenance and ease of manufacture. Whether it is movies, television or music, it is often the spectacle, not stardom, that is being marketed.
Producers can even draw on veterans of past reality shows or characters created and controlled by movie studios to produce programming and bigger profits.
Mr. Burnett said he was willing to use stars in his shows, but they would be of his own making: In ''Survivor 8,'' the winners from past seasons will face off in an All-Star version.
There was no second-guessing of a system that seemed to have failed again.
Instead, for the family of 14-year-old Matthew Calbi, who the police believe was beaten to death by his mother on Sunday -- just two months after New Jersey child welfare officials returned him to her custody -- there is nothing but grief.
''Somebody said to me, 'Is the family pointing fingers at this point?' '' said Brian Sokoloff, Matthew's uncle. ''I said, 'They're so numb, they don't even know they have fingers at this point.' ''
So now, Mr. Sokoloff said at the home of Matthew's father, Christopher Calbi, in Teaneck, N.J., there is only mourning for the boy, who was a juggler, a fan of hip-hop music, and the kind of teenager whose idea of a perfect world was a place where the Yankees never lost another game.
And today, family and friends tried their best to remember Matthew by those threads of his young life rather than the attention given in his death.
The authorities believe that Matthew was punched and kicked so badly by his mother, Linda J. Calbi, during an altercation Sunday afternoon that he suffered massive internal bleeding that led to his death. Ms. Calbi, 47, of Old Tappan, N.J., has been charged with murder and child endangerment and is being held in bail of $1 million.
State child welfare officials, already under intense scrutiny this year, have promised to look into their handling of the Calbi family's case. Matthew died about three months after he and his brother were temporarily removed from Ms. Calbi's custody by child welfare officials concerned for the boys' safety after the authorities said she overdosed on prescription drugs. A month later, she was given custody again.
It was one of four investigations of the family since 2001. And a spokesman for the child welfare agency promised a thorough examination.
''We're going to conduct an exhaustive review,'' said Ed Rogan, a spokesman for the state Division of Youth and Family Services. ''As with any of the cases we deal with, we want to get to the bottom of it. Certainly, if there are any failures found, we are going to address them.''
The agency has come under intense scrutiny since the body of 7-year-old Faheem Williams was found in a locked Newark basement in January.
The state has promised a sweeping overhaul of child welfare. As part of that effort, it settled a lawsuit in June with Children's Rights Inc., a Manhattan-based advocacy group, by agreeing, in part, to the creation of an independent Child Welfare Panel with broad powers to reshape the agency.
Social work experts have pushed for change, citing child deaths around the state that they say could have been prevented. They also cite the agency's routine failure to recognize what experts say are obvious signs of abuse.
In Matthew's case, investigators found that two allegations of abuse made against his parents in the last 18 months were not substantiated.
While the state began its review of the Calbi family's case file, Mr. Calbi declined to speak to reporters today. Mr. Sokoloff, who acted as the family spokesman, said the Calbis divorced several years ago. Officials have placed Matthew's brother, Dean, 9, in Mr. Calbi's custody.
Mr. Sokoloff, who declined to discuss the family's dealings with child welfare officials, said the family members were focused solely on helping one another through the grieving process.
''I'm not interested in dealing with the political issues,'' he said. ''I'm worried about my family and keeping it intact, and keeping a 9-year-old, Matthew's brother, who is also the joy of everyone's life, trying to spare this kid from as much of this horror as is possible.''
Mr. Sokoloff said Matthew was an active, charming teenager. He joked that his nephew had only one fault: his love of the Yankees.
''We have endless debates about it,'' said Mr. Sokoloff, a Mets fan. ''Among my many, many deep regrets is one trifling regret that he wasn't able to live long enough where I could say, 'Matt, you see, the Mets are better than the Yankees.' ''
The two also had playful debates about music. ''He was endlessly trying to convince me of the artistic merit of rap music, and he would make CD's. 'Listen to this, listen to this,' '' Mr. Sokoloff said, noting that his response was always the same: ''Matthew, this is not music.''
''It's hard to fathom that he's not here,'' Mr. Sokoloff said. ''He was really a bright light to many people.''
Conventional wisdom suggests that three no-trump is normally preferable to five of a minor suit unless the deal is very distributional or there is a serious weakness in a major suit. (Less often, a weakness in the other minor is a problem.) The diagramed deal does not, however, fit this generalization. There are no singletons, and the unbid suits are all doubly stopped. It was played at the Tri-State Regional Swiss Teams in Secaucus, N.J., this month.
The raise to two diamonds was inverted, indicating invitational values or better. South was Gail Greenberg, and she continued when three no-trump was reached because, with a wealth of aces and kings, she was hoping for a slam. Her partner, Stan Turecki, cooperated with one cue-bid but then, with minimum values for the original raise, subsided in five diamonds. Since this was imp scoring, the normal matchpoint tendency to play in three no-trump was not a factor.
Looking only at the North-South hands, six diamonds would have offered fair play, needing a normal trump split and a guess for the club jack. Five diamonds was a certainty with good technique. South won the heart lead in her hand and cashed two top trumps. With the bad split revealed, she took two spade winners and the heart king. Next she ruffed dummy's remaining heart. West refused to endplay himself by overruffing, but this simply postponed the evil day. A trump lead forced him to break clubs or give a ruff-and-sluff.
In the replay, East-West were Tom Smith and Gene Saxe. East doubled two diamonds rather than bid his hearts, and three no-trump was reached. A spade was led, and South simply played diamonds, giving himself virtually no chance. He had to lose three spade tricks, a diamond and a club. After one or two top diamonds, declarer should have tried to guess the position of the club jack and make three tricks in the suit. That could have given him nine tricks but would have been difficult to do in view of East's takeout double. Notice that a first-round finesse against West would have been necessary. Leading to the king would not have been good enough.
Defeating a game that looked easy gave the Greenberg team 10 imps, and they went on to win the title.
SOME developers with grand dreams, like Donald Trump, put their mark on urban America by building the tallest, boldest buildings around.
Then there is Tilman J. Fertitta, who has brought two things to downtown Houston that it never had before: a 90-foot Ferris wheel and a miniature train that chugs through a tunnel in a tank filled with sharks.
Mr. Fertitta, the chief executive and largest shareholder of Landry's Restaurants Inc., develops what are known as ''eatertainment'' projects, and as part of his grand vision, he is buying or signing long-term leases on prime coastal properties nationwide.
But his most vigorous activity so far is in Texas. In Houston, the neon-trimmed ferris wheel appeared six months ago as part of a seven-acre entertainment complex on the banks of Buffalo Bayou. It is joined by a merry-go-round, an aquarium, carnival games, two restaurants, a ballroom and, most spectacularly, the shark train.
''I said to myself, 'Kids love trains and kids love sharks; why not drive a train through sharks?' '' said Mr. Fertitta, sitting proudly in the little train as sharks swam menacingly around his head.
Mr. Fertitta, 46, builds developments that can transform entire towns. Five years ago, he opened a 40-acre boardwalk of shops, restaurants and rides in the coastal town of Kemah, southeast of Houston. To cope with weekend crowds of up to 50,000 people, Kemah, a once-sleepy shrimping village, had to double the size of its police force, to 20. On Galveston Island, Landry's accumulated six blocks along the seawall and built a complex of restaurants and attractions, including a fake volcano that erupts every half-hour in the evenings.
Mr. Fertitta himself owns a 22-acre beachfront resort in Galveston and is building a 70,000-square-foot convention center next to it. Farther down the Texas coast, in Corpus Christi, his company has proposed to lease the city marina and build an entertainment complex on the surrounding 10 acres.
All this activity has generated no small measure of controversy, and Mr. Fertitta finds himself parrying criticism from two sides: preservationists who deride his projects as tacky, and financial analysts who question whether they make business sense.
But he shows no signs of backing away from any of them, and he has a solid base of support. Just about everywhere he goes, municipal authorities are desperate for his investments and the jobs and tax revenue they create.
Certainly, his detractors don't mince words. ''Tilman Fertitta is like the Donald Trump of the Southwest,'' said Frances Farenthold, known as Sissy, who represented Corpus Christi in the Texas Legislature from 1968 to 1973 and is a staunch opponent of the proposed deal in that city. ''He's taking over the whole Gulf Coast and putting up Ferris wheels. I can't think that's the highest and best use of our shoreline.''
Neither can Cynthia Fowler, a Houston resident and board member of Scenic America, a nonprofit group dedicated to preserving the landscapes and architectural character of communities. She called Mr. Fertitta's $40 million midway-style complex in her city's business district ''just plain cheesy and wildly inappropriate for that location.''
And Gary L. Gray, a management consultant and Kemah resident, dismissed the ''glitzy tourist trap that's cheapened the character and ruined the old, salty flavor of this town.''
SUCH barbs clearly wound Mr. Fertitta, who defends his projects with the intensity of a misunderstood artist. ''There's nothing cheesy about them,'' he said, seeming both intimidating and imploring with his steel-gray eyes, boyish buzz cut and tendency to lean into his listener.
Slings come from stock analysts, too. They contend that he should stick to restaurants, which include the chains Landry's Seafood House, Joe's Crab Shack, the Crab House, Willie G's, Cadillac Bar, Rainforest Cafe, Charley's Crab, Chart House and Salt Grass Steak House. ''A shark train and erupting volcano are really cool, but you've got to wonder what the longevity of these things are,'' said Barry Stouffer, a restaurant analyst in Nashville for BB&T Capital Markets.
A look at Mr. Fertitta's past entertainment projects shows that he knows how to negotiate favorable deals. The development in Houston, for example, is on city land for which Landry's has a 40-year lease that is fixed at $150,000 a year; in most commercial leases, the price rises along with property values. The city, which is suffering from falling tax revenues, even persuaded the Texas Department of Transportation to let the company build a pay-parking lot under a nearby highway overpass.
''We clearly needed something that would draw people downtown and the sales taxes that would go along with that,'' said Annise Parker, a Houston city councilwoman.
Mr. Fertitta has received sweeteners elsewhere, too. Kemah sold his company a waterfront street for $300,000, a price that city officials described as ''heavily discounted.'' Galveston is providing the financing for the convention center that Mr. Fertitta is building. His company will operate it using proceeds from the city's hotel occupancy tax and will receive half the profits. And he has refused to budge on demands that Corpus Christi limit competition and make $20 million in improvements to the city-owned marina before he invests a cent. Under pressure from activists like Ms. Farenthold, otherwise eager city officials there told him that they need some concessions before they can consider any deal.
Local governments tend to be eager to sign on with Mr. Fertitta because his brainstorms promise to bring in revenue. Landry's is the largest private employer in Galveston, and Roger Quiroga, the city's mayor, said its investments had prompted ''the biggest economic boom we've seen in decades.'' In Houston, there are long lines at the shark train on weekends and evenings in the previously moribund downtown.
The outlook isn't all rosy. The crowds at the Kemah entertainment complex have fallen off, for example. Landry's debt has risen sharply this year, its cash balance has shrunk and its restaurant sales, which still account for most of its business, have tapered off.
The company says it expects sales to rebound and to top $1 billion this year. Mr. Fertitta's food empire now includes 285 restaurants in 36 states. For a while in the mid-1990's, he gained national attention by having lavish fund-raisers at his Houston home for President Bill Clinton.
Landry's went public in 1993, and today Mr. Fertitta owns 21 percent of the stock, a stake worth $127 million at the current share price of $22, up from a low of $4 in 1999. He is annoyed by analysts' criticism of his company's relatively low rate of return on its restaurant investment, saying that while his better-performing rivals gravitate to suburban strip malls, he is buying prime coastal real estate. ''I can't sail a boat 100 miles along the coast of the United States without hitting one of my restaurants,'' he boasted.
Mr. Fertitta has been buying up struggling restaurant chains at a furious pace recently -- ''bottom feeding,'' in the words of Bob Goldin, a restaurant consultant at Technomic Inc. in Chicago. He continues to look for entertainment outlets, even getting into a bidding war in March with Ripley Entertainment Inc. of Orlando, Fla., for a bankrupt aquarium in Denver and ultimately paying $13.6 million, triple the asking price, to buy it. What many of his purchases have in common is water -- whether sloshing in giant fish tanks or lapping on nearby shores, from the beach in Malibu, Calif., to the Hudson River. (The company has Chart House restaurants in Dobbs Ferry, N.Y., and Weehawken, N.J.)
Mr. Fertitta's detractors fear that he now has Trump-style casinos in mind and will push for legalized gambling in Texas. Asked about that, he slapped both hands on a table and said, ''Show me where I've been lobbying for gambling.'' But, he added: ''If gambling does come, I'm not going to sit by while someone next door beats my brains out.''
Mr. Fertitta's developments evoke Las Vegas in their grandiosity, and he is involved in every detail. He flies in his helicopter among his properties, where minions scurry behind him jotting down his orders, as when he asked that a piece of granite be installed over a slightly scuffed section of Sheetrock at the Houston complex.
''He once tore out the same wall four times before he was satisfied,'' said Matthew D. Wiggins, who leases property to Mr. Fertitta in Kemah. ''I couldn't see anything wrong with any of them, but that's why he's got his pile of money and my pile is a whole lot smaller.''
A good guideline for intermediate players is: With strong trumps, lead them unless there is urgent work to be done in a side suit. That may be maneuvering a ruff, or taking a discard, or solving entry problems.
The diagramed deal, played in a California tournament, suggests a rare exception that is easy to overlook. It was noted by Christopher Bohan and forwarded by Andrew Gumperz.
There are two schools of thought about the bid of one spade when one heart has been doubled. Traditionally this was nonforcing, but the modern tendency is to play it as forcing. Here it was irrelevant, since in either style South had an obvious rebid of his six-card heart suit. East-West wisely subsided: an attempt to compete with three clubs would probably have failed by two tricks.
The opening lead against two hearts was the diamond jack, which did not seem threatening. In view of West's takeout double, South had little hope of scoring a club trick. He was therefore focused on collecting five tricks in trumps and three in diamonds.
The declarer won the first trick in his hand, led to the heart king, and returned to his hand with a diamond lead to continue trumps. He cashed the heart ace, collecting the queen, and continued with the 10. Unfortunately for him East won with the jack in this position:
East shifted to a club, and West took his two tricks in that suit. When the top spades were cashed, East was able to dispose of his last diamond and score the decisive ruff.
South should have seen this coming and resisted the urge to plow blindly on with trumps. If he had cashed his diamond trick after the heart queen fell, he would have been sure of his eight tricks.
The third trump lead would have been right, if the trumps were splitting evenly and the diamonds were divided 5-2. But that was unlikely. If West had begun with Q-J-6 of hearts, he might have played the jack rather than the queen, and he might not have had a suitable hand for a takeout double.
Because fashion shows so often these days resemble trade fairs or carnival sideshows, with designers serving as pitchman or clown and a booty of free products waiting at your seat (U.P.S. is a sponsor this season; does that mean a free truck for every girl and boy?), one is never entirely surprised when the clothes are banal or camp. It's all part of the same shill game.
Kenneth Cole kicked off the spring 2004 season on Friday with tote bags for all and a film lightly spoofing his 20-year career as a designer and supporter of various causes. What Mr. Cole is, above all, is a businessman, and the clothes he presented in the tents at Bryant Park reflect the thinking of someone who knows how to project an image of hip urgency without selling the farm: crisp windbreakers and white jeans for the guys, and pencil-slim bermudas, stiletto sandals and ribbed undershirts for the girls. It was a spree of casual clothes buffed with a risk-free gloss of sex.
Given the popularity of reality TV and the built-in opportunity to make a fool of oneself for relatively small change, the Pierrot show seemed deftly on the money as models evinced the action (sort of) of a pornographic movie being shot in, of all places, the ballroom of the Pennsylvania Hotel on Seventh Avenue. While clumps of Saturday tourists were down in the lobby waiting to catch the train back to Stroudsburg, Pa., Mimi Rogers, the actress formerly known as Mrs. Tom Cruise, was upstairs giving a winning performance in the ''Belle de Jour'' role of the older madam petting her young charge against a backdrop of cheap paneling and a poster of kittens.
Ms. Rogers certainly showed game and didn't look half bad in a lacy pastel knit sheath that you could, in fact, imagine on a Stroudsburg matron. Most of the clothes were sweet and kittenish: ruffled knit miniskirts and frisky camisole tops. And since no one under the age of 30 takes an image or pronouncement straight, it's hard to muster moral indignation over sweaters depicting couples coupling or, for erotic plantsmen, flowers with enlarged stamens.
The only thing the designer, Pierre Carrilero, seems unwilling to risk is for the audience to forget what it sees the moment it splits for the next freak show. Hence the hubba-hubba.
Before the big stars of ready-to-wear come along later in the week, the collections are warmed up by lesser-known talents, and a few had novel things to say over the weekend. The designers of Cloak -- Alexandre Plokhov and Robert Geller -- presented a cool show against the strafed surface of a former meatpacking plant. The models had the slack look of rockers subsisting on corn chips, hair streaming over bony shoulders and knackered leather jackets. The clothes were in the groove of Ann Demeulemeester and Hedi Slimane -- lovely and a little nasty -- with these great leather trousers worn low and tight on the hips and drooping with that esprit de fatigue in the crotch.
The quartet of designers behind the new label As Four demonstrated staying power with a collection that seemed eager to test the limits of conventional design and construction. Pod-shaped coats and Flash Gordon pantaloons in metallic print fabrics had a futuristic flavor without too many comic-book overtones.
In fact, the show's styling (big, elaborate 60's hair) brought to mind the spacey jet-set tranquillity of ''Boom,'' the 1968 Joseph Losey film starring Elizabeth Taylor in an assortment of caftans and jewels. The best dresses were suspended by cords from the shoulders, wrapped lightly around the body and curled at the edges with piping, so that they fluttered like an overturned spray of calla lilies. The abundant use of semi-cheesy gold fabrics and flower appliqués was interesting, too. It drew a line back to the early days of the wearable art movement, in the early 70's, recalling the free-form style of the late San Francisco designer Kaisik Wong and the drag group the Cockettes.
Subtlety was the missing button at Veteran, a new line of recycled clothes by Danny Seo, formerly with Imitation of Christ, and his partner Anamyn Turowski. They have plumbed the warehouses of ragpickers for old Hawaiian shirts and military khaki, spritzing them with beads and tie-dyed sunbursts (and mixing them with canvas shorts made from Home Depot dropcloths). But the show brought little new direction to a well-trod theme, and their mostly conservative styles had all the nuance and surprise of a Tommy Hilfiger wardrobe deconstructed.
A return to volume will be the more important story of the spring collections. Rebecca Taylor's ultrapretty dresses featured Empire waists, gauzy skirts in pale sea colors and tight jersey tops edged in sequins.
In her show yesterday, Maria Cornejo found imaginative ways to hint at volume without undermining the long, graceful line of her clothes. One cotton empire dress combined a waistband of shadowy blue dots on gray silk with a pod-shaped skirt of white cotton. Blouses cut with dressmaker precision in the front showed a draper's finesse in the back as they drifted over slim white minis or cropped pants. Ms. Cornejo's clothes display a sporty formality that is hugely appealing at the moment, and as always she pays attention to the finishing details, like ironing, that are the mark of a pro.
Of all the shows over the weekend, though, the one that stood out for the right reasons was Patrick Robinson's presentation for Perry Ellis. Mr. Robinson, who is about to become a father (his wife is Virginia Smith, an editor at Vogue), proved that what's often missing from big-brand revivals is not more hype, but plain old fashion. With such simple gestures as slouchy pencil skirts, adorable tops in faded rose tones and a charming granny skirt in a circle print, he has brought new respect to a great American fashion name.
''When I looked back at Perry's early collections, the thing I loved most was his sense of optimism,'' Mr. Robinson said. Charm and optimism: how complicated can it be?
Cute as the Chicago Cubs are, do they deserve the prime-time slot given them by Fox Sports for Game 1 of tonight's National League division series against Atlanta?
They have Sammy Sosa, pitchers Mark Prior and Kerry Wood and the distinct allure of no World Series championships in 95 years. But heavens to Orval Overall (who won the decisive fifth game of the 1908 Series), they're not the Yankees, whose opening division series game against Minnesota will be on ESPN today at 1 p.m.
Are the Yankees even awake that early after so many nocturnal playoff openers?
Dare we call this Game 1 the early-bird special?
The very idea of a 1 p.m. Game 1 offends George Steinbrenner, the Yankees' principal owner. ''I'm not happy,'' Steinbrenner said in a statement. ''It eliminates a lot of people who are forced to work at that time. The Yankees are the biggest draw in baseball, and tied for the very best record. Who else should be in prime time?''
Well, how about the Cubs and the Braves?
''If I had the decision-making process,'' Steinbrenner continued, ''I'd put the Yankees in the night game. We're the best-known team and that's where we belong.''
The choice of scheduling the Cubs-Braves opener in prime time over Game 1 of the Twins-Yankees was in the hands of Fox and ESPN. With the first prime-time slot available, Fox chose the Cubs-Braves. ESPN would have done the same.
Of the three games in the series that have been assigned starting times, all three will be at night; the next two are on ESPN, tomorrow at 7 p.m. and Friday at 8 p.m.
Fox will return Thursday night to what Steinbrenner might call sanity with Game 2 of the Twins-Yankees series.
Fox and ESPN believe in the Cubs and the Braves. It's one superstation team, the Cubs (the pride of WGN), against the Braves (with 90 games on TBS, a former superstation turned into a basic cable channel). They're two teams with national followings thanks to WGN's and TBS's broad placement on cable systems.
''It's a heck of a matchup,'' Ed Goren, the president of Fox Sports, said yesterday in a conference call. ''We can start with a sexy National League matchup and come back on Thursday with a great American League matchup.''
(Should we read between the lines here, that a sexy game trumps a great one?)
Mark Shapiro, an executive vice president of ESPN, said: ''There are plenty of Yankee fans, but it's in the best interest of Major League Baseball to put more teams on the national stage. The Yankees always get prime time, but it's only the second time since 1989 that the Cubs are in postseason. You have to take advantage of their passionate fan base.''
Statistics will point the way to surging passion for the Yankees and the Cubs, but not necessarily for the Twins and the Braves.
For example, Nielsen ratings of Cubs games on WGN soared by 39 percent and by 47 on the local Fox Sports Net outlet. On the YES Network, which carries most Yankee games, ratings leaped by 79 percent, but they fell by 19 percent on Channel 2, which feasted in 2002 when Cablevision blacked out the games.
Meanwhile, the Braves' TBS national ratings sank 27 percent (a loss of 300,000 TV households) because of more late-night and day games, but its local Turner South ratings grew by 9 percent. The Twins' terrific post-All Star Game surge did not benefit local cable ratings on Fox Sports Net, which fell 11 percent.
Verdict: A Yankees-Cubs World Series would be in the sport's best interest.
When the Braves beat the Cubs in a National League division series in 1998, the 6.6 rating (from games on Fox, NBC and ESPN) was 43 percent better than the three other division series, including the Yankees' sweep of Texas. Fox's 8.3 rating for one Cubs-Braves game was its best division-series rating, except for Game 5's.
Verdict: With a stronger Cubs team than in 1998, Fox's decision to start the division series with the Cubs-Braves might not be a bad idea.
The Braves, who have won 12 straight division crowns (not including 1994, the strike year) but only one World Series in that span, acquitted themselves well in last year's division series.
The Giants-Braves series rated a 5.1, a smidgen less than the 5.5 for the Angels' upset of the Yankees. Each rating point equals 1.06 million TV homes.
Verdict: Watching underdogs thrash the Yankees is great fun for the country, so a Cubs-Yankees World Series might be the highest-rated ever.
Looking ahead is the fantasy of a Red Sox-Cubs World Series. There was no electronic measurement of the Cubs' national appeal in 1908 when they beat Detroit for their last world championship. But no World Series rating since 1986 has come within 16 percent of the hyper-dramatic Red Sox-Mets affair.
Textbooks on the game often focus on the situations in which the declarer draws trumps. They say little, however, about the defenders' need to do likewise. On the diagramed deal, West had a chronic allergy to playing trumps, and it proved fatal.
East's one no-trump was the weak variety, showing about 13 high-card points. West was nevertheless headed for game but allowed himself to be diverted when South, who had been strangely silent on the first round, chimed in with two spades after a Stayman response and a two-heart rebid from East. West should simply have raised to four hearts, which would have succeeded from the East position. With West declarer on a different auction, the diamond queen lead from North is effective.
At this vulnerability, West was tempted to think that a double would collect 500 for down two, better than he could expect for making a game. The vulnerability was in his favor, and he knew that South would be trying to make eight tricks with at most seven trumps and about 14 high-card points. But low-level penalty doubles work best when the hand is a misfit, and West knew that his side held nine cards in hearts.
The occasion was the Life Master Open Pairs at the 2002 Fall Nationals, and Hugh Ross, a two-time world champion, was South. He was not happy at being doubled, and neither was his partner. But the defense helped.
West led a heart and South ruffed. He led a low club, and if West had played low, permitting his partner to win and lead a trump, the penalty would have been 800. But West put up his club king, fearing that South held the ace-queen, and led a second heart. South ruffed again, cashed the club ace and played a third round of that suit.
West ruffed, missing another chance for his partner to gain the lead, and should have cashed the spade ace, removing dummy's innocuous-looking five. Instead he led a third heart, and South ruffed to reach this position:
The club six was led, and West had his last chance. He should have ruffed with the spade jack, cashed his trump winners, and reverted to hearts. That would have netted him the 500 points he wanted. But he was reluctant to ''waste'' his spade jack, so he discarded a diamond. South scored dummy's useless-looking trump and took a diamond finesse. When the finesse won, Ross repeated it. This time West ruffed and led one more heart.
South ruffed again and led his diamond ace. West ruffed, and South had the spade queen for the last trick. Thanks to West's allergy to leading trumps, Ross made his unlikely contract. He scored six of his seven trumps, a most surprising development looking at the total layout.
Taking a finesse at the first trick, with a king or a queen being the crucial card, is not uncommon. But worrying about an eight is very rare. The worrier on the diagramed deal was Larry Cohen of Boca Raton, Fla., long one of the country's best players. It took place in the Cavendish Pairs this May in Las Vegas.
How many clubs South should bid after hearing a one-diamond opening on his right is highly debatable. Any number from two to five is conceivable. Five would be extreme and likely to give up a penalty. Two would be normal, but would not put pressure on the opponents. Four has merit, but Cohen chose three. This pre-emptive action would be unthinkable but for North's previous pass, making game unlikely.
West doubled negatively and doubled again when North surprised with a jump to five clubs. The lead was the club five, and South saw that he had been given a reprieve. A pointed-suit lead would have given the defense three quick tricks. He could see 10 tricks, counting an eventual diamond ruff, but needed an 11th.
One obvious play was to take two spade discards on the top hearts and lead a diamond. But that was virtually certain to fail, for the defense would surely be able to lead a second trump. The best chance was surely to establish hearts, hoping for an even split. For that purpose all dummy's trumps would have to provide entries to the dummy. The jack would be one obvious entry, and the deuce would score a ruff in due course, but how about the seven?
If West had led from eight-five, the finesse of the seven would do the trick. But if he had led from five-three, the immediate play of the jack would bring down the singleton eight. Superficially, these chances are equal, but appearances are deceptive. The doubleton eight with West is twice as likely. West would not have wasted the eight, but might have led either card from a five-three doubleton. The principle of restricted choice applied.
So Cohen called for the seven, and was happy when it won. He cashed the top hearts, throwing spades, and ruffed a heart. The obvious play was to give up a diamond, but he gave himself a faint extra chance by leading the spade queen. East won, and was able to enter his partner's hand with a diamond lead. The club eight came back, eliminating the slight chance of two diamond ruffs.
The club jack won in dummy, and another heart ruff settled the issue. Since the last heart in dummy was a winner, Cohen could claim his doubled game, announcing that he would ruff a diamond and take a discard.
Louis Armstrong did not catalog his possessions according to the rules of library science. For example, though he kept song indexes for his collection of 650 reel-to-reel tapes in neat three-ring binders, he curiously alphabetized titles by their last word. So ''The Girl That I Married,'' on side one of reel No. 44, is cataloged on the line above ''In the Mood.''
But over all his archives demonstrate an enormous sense of purpose in leaving a documentable footprint on the world, even beyond his performances and recordings. Part of his archives is displayed at the Louis Armstrong House in Corona, Queens, which has been renovated and is having a ribbon-cutting ceremony today before opening to the public for tours starting tomorrow.
Since 1991 it has been Michael Cogswell's job to organize all of Armstrong's personal effects. Comfortable in the home that his wife Lucille busily managed, Armstrong was perhaps relieved by the sense of security he felt after being sent to a home for wayward boys, spending 20 protean years on the road and being married three previous times. He left much evidence of his nesting habits. Mr. Cogswell, as director of the Louis Armstrong House and Archives, based at Queens College's Flushing campus, has sorted and stored every tape, record, photograph, trumpet, cocktail jigger, ashtray, book, unsent letter, diary entry, trumpet and laxative packet in the house, where Armstrong lived with Lucille from 1943 to his death in 1971. (Lucille lived there until she died in 1983.)
''We have to ask ourselves why Louis was, for example, making all these tapes and cataloging their content,'' Mr. Cogswell said the other day, standing in Armstrong's small study before a portrait of Armstrong painted by Tony Bennett. ''Part of it is him being the great communicator -- he'd knock off a seven-page letter to a fan, thinking nothing of it. But on another level Louis had a sense of his place in history. I think he sensed that these tapes would survive him.''
Much of the drive to ready the three-story brick house as a public historic site came from Mr. Cogswell, 50, an affable Virginian with a zigzag background. He has raised most of the money for the $1.6 million renovation of the house on 107th Street in what is now primarily a Dominican, Ecuadorean and Colombian neighborhood.
After spending a few years at the University of Virginia, he dropped out in 1973 to make a living as a saxophonist, moving to Boston and working in R&B and jazz bands. In 1981 he returned to the University of Virginia to study musicology.
''My mentor there was a Harvard-trained musicologist named Ernest Campbell Mead, who wore a bow tie and a seersucker suit,'' he said. ''I couldn't believe how great it was that this guy's job was to stand up in front of a class, play records and talk about them. I wondered, why isn't somebody doing this for jazz? He's talking about Josquin'' -- the Renaissance composer -- ''he's talking about Beethoven; how come somebody isn't doing the same thing for Ellington or Charlie Parker?''
In 1983 Mr. Cogswell earned his bachelor's degree in music, and then the university offered him a job in charge of the sound-recordings collection in its music library. Three years later he started a master's degree program in musicology at the University of North Texas, and found work at that school's music library, which brought him closer to jazz archivism. That school is renowned for its jazz big-band instruction, and keeps Stan Kenton's entire archives, as well as a collection of rare Duke Ellington recordings. That is where he was when a listing for the job of arranging, preserving and cataloging the Armstrong Collection, owned (as it is still) by Queens College, crossed his desk in the Music Library Association's job newsletter. ''I took a look at it and said, That's my dream job,'' he said.
Two weeks later he had the job. He and his wife, Dale Van Dyke, moved to New York. On his first day he was faced with the reality of the situation.
''There were 72 cartons of Armstrong's stuff, a desk, a chair, a sofa and not much else,'' he remembered. Besides creating proper storage systems for everything there, he began collecting other items related to Armstrong from around the world. Much of this collection is featured in his book, ''Louis Armstrong: The Offstage Story of Satchmo,'' published this month by Collectors Press.
Mr. Cogswell said Armstrong would be happy with how things have turned out. ''He'd be delighted that people are enjoying his house,'' he said. ''One of the things we have on exhibit is his F.B.I. file, and I always chuckle to think of the F.B.I. maintaining a file on Armstrong. He was the most open guy you'd ever want to meet.''
 LONDON, Oct. 24 — Imagine a world where Porsche came out with its 911 series shortly after Henry Ford invented the Model T, only to take its sleek roadsters off the street because they became expensive to maintain and appealed to only the most elitist of drivers. 
 That is essentially what transpired Friday morning when the final Concorde flight touched down here at Heathrow International Airport. With the shutdown of the service by British Airways , and by Air France last May, supersonic commercial travel became a thing of the past. Technology took a step backward. Tears flowed freely, from the tarmac here to boardrooms in Manhattan. 
 It is unlikely that supersonic commercial flight, at least on the scale of the Concorde, will be revived anytime in the near future, largely because the Concorde showed that such an operation was not financially viable, industry executives and experts say. 
 "You should never say never, but it will not happen anytime soon," said Philippe Camus, co-chief-executive of the European Aeronautic Defence and Space Company, the main parent company of Airbus, which maintains the Concorde planes. "There's no evidence there's any market for that." 
 On the cost side, the Concorde planes, which were built in the 1970's, consumed huge amounts of fuel and were becoming expensive to maintain. Airbus recently told British Airways and Air France that the fleets would require some major overhauls within the next two years. For British Airways, the estimated bill was up to £40 million, or nearly $70 million, said David Noyes, British Airways' executive vice president for sales and marketing in North America. 
 Those spiraling costs come during a bleak revenue environment. The hamstrung economy has spurred companies to cut down on business travel costs. Paying $6,336 to fly one-way across the Atlantic on British Airways, or about $5,000 on Air France, quickly lost its appeal, even though catching the Concorde could shave several hours off of the usual flight time. 
 Both airlines declined to give specific information on how profitable or unprofitable the Concorde was. "In the past, the Concorde was profitable," Mr. Noyes said, but it was losing money after it was returned to service following an Air France crash in 2000 that killed 113 people. A spokesman for Air France, Jean-Jacques de Saint Andrieu, said that his airline's Concorde operation was profitable "in some years." 
 Part of the reason the airlines could claim some profitability on the Concorde was because they did not have to incur capital costs on the planes, said Daniel Solon, who works in Barcelona for Avmark International, an aviation consulting firm. The governments of England and France underwrote the costs of building the 14 Concordes, which were then turned over to the two national airlines. 
 The noise levels of the jets hampered how much money British Airways and Air France could make off of them. The jets' sonic booms prevented them from being flown to any great degree over populated areas. Lockheed Martin and the United States government are looking at bringing down supersonic noise on military aircraft, and if that project were ever to come to fruition, then its application to the commercial world could lead to much greater uses for jetliners flying at the speed of the Concorde, industry experts say. 
 "The airplane's potential network was limited by noise," said Robert W. Mann, an industry consultant based in Port Washington, N.Y. "When it was first used in this country on demonstration runs, the first words out of people's mouths was, `God, that's a loud airplane!' " 
 Mr. Mann said he expected to see in the next several years the introduction of small business jets that travel slightly faster than Mach 1, the speed of sound. (The Concorde flew at Mach 2, or about 1,350 miles an hour.) That is because the airline industry is fragmenting into smaller niche markets, he said, with the most elite travelers still willing to pay top money for conveniences while many people gravitate to no-frills, low-fare airlines like Southwest. 
 Still, as business-class and first-class cabins get more comfortable, people's desire to touch down on the ground as soon as possible will probably diminish. Offerings of flat beds, Internet service and wide video selections in those cabins undermine the need for Concorde-class speed, especially if the time saved ends up costing hundreds of dollars a minute. 
When it comes to seizing the moment, few soccer clubs are better at it than Manchester United. Very few companies are brasher at it than Nike.
Perhaps we shouldn't be surprised that at the 11th hour of the 11th day of the 11th month — a time of specific remembrance — the club and the shoe company choose to call a media conference in New York to sell their wares.
Summoning the journalists, ChampionsWorld, the consulting firm that arranged the press call, stated: "Sir Alex Ferguson, manager of English Premier League Champions Manchester United, and ChampionsWorld will make an announcement at Niketown in New York City on Tuesday, November 11 at 11:00 a.m. Following the announcement, the Manchester United manager and Charlie Stillitano will be available for interviews."
What could it mean, this "announcement" that coincides with the hour on which the World War I armistice went into effect 85 years ago? What had soccer to trumpet at a time that many reserve for Armistice Day silence, and Americans now call Veterans' Day?
It means they are selling something. It means that United, which a year ago made its first U.S. tour since 1982, is going back there next summer. Even with Concorde grounded, Sir Alex was flown in by Nike from Manchester to Manhattan to personalize the announcement.
Nike is one of the sponsors making United the richest club in the world. America is the unconquered market for pro soccer. And $349 million — the amount Nike started to pay United over a 13-year partnership starting last August — gives the sponsor rights to get its message across.
Why Tuesday, why that particular day at that particular hour, and especially on this particular year when the fallout of war is all around us? Because, say the marketing men, this was the most convenient time to get Alex Ferguson.
He has a free week while his players are scattered across various fields on duty with their national teams, some of them in Euro 2004 playoff games this weekend, some further afield in South America where World Cup 2006 qualifying matches are already taking place.
Not that this is an idle week for Sir Alex. He is tying up another new contract, reported to be around £4 million a year, or $6.66 million, for three years, which will take his tenure at Manchester to 21 years. He is also a wanted man. The Football Association in London had set Tuesday for his reply to the FA's demand for an explanation as to why he appeared to impugn the ruling body's integrity last month. Sir Alex had been fined and banished from the touchline for two games for abusive language to a referee. He had later accused the FA of "doing a deal" with Arsenal, his own club's great rival, suggesting that punishments for Arsenal players brawling against United were too lenient. Presumably, in the air or on the ground in New York, Sir Alex found a moment or two to compose an answer to meet his deadline.
Meanwhile, he was on a mission. Two years ago, when Ferguson approached his 60th birthday, he announced that he was retiring from the cut and thrust of soccer management. One option open to him was to travel the globe as a Nike emissary.
He backed off retirement, maintained the compulsion to manage his team, got rid of David Beckham and started rebuilding the new United squad. The Beckham transfer to Real Madrid had many reasons — not least Sir Alex's disapproval of the lifestyle of Mr. and Mrs. Beckham and their courting of world acclaim.
Down the list of considerations, but not off it, was that United planned to break into the markets of the Americas. Nike is smoothing that, and when last summer's tour was arranged, the question of Beckham and his Adidas sponsorship lurked in the background. In the nick of time, Beckham was sold to a club whose own major sponsor happens to be Adidas.
Meantime, the Americanization of United was being forged in other directions. When a marketing deal was signed between the English club and YankeeNets, a U.S. sporting holding company, another United knight, Sir Bobby Charlton, took exception to a journalist's question.
"We are not," Charlton insisted, "going into this to make money. We are not in the process of selling our souls to another sport." The selling of souls? Well, maybe not to another sport.
United has been selling shares across the globe for many years. The public listing of the club started in 1991, and right now there is speculation that some of the major shareholders abroad are mounting a full take over bid.
John Paul (J.P.) McManus and John Magnier, Irish racehorse tycoons and one-time very close friends of Ferguson, have built a 23 percent stake in United without ever stating their intentions or their love of soccer. John de Mol, a Dutch television mogul who created the Big Brother series, has 4 percent.
But if there is a takeover merchant, a man who might seriously buy out the rest, the finger points to Malcolm Glazer, owner of the Super Bowl champion Tampa Bay Buccaneers. Followers of the Bucs will tell you that nobody knows what Glazer will do until he closes out the deal. He could be acquiring shares in United because it's the best-known soccer club on the planet. He could be hoping to sell out at a profit. Or he could be the one who covets the whole club, and the undeveloped potential it has to stimulate a U.S. fan base and to penetrate the Latin American market.
Back in Asia, United's "Red Devil" brand is under sustained attack by Real Madrid. In Britain, Peter Kenyon, the man who marketed United in the East, has defected to Chelsea and its new owner, Roman Abramovich.
Time to move on. And no time, obviously, is immune from the selling.
Without, er, fanfare, two Tufts University engineering researchers announced results of a study last week rebutting a popular myth among some trumpet players that deep-freezing the instruments will change the sound for the better.
Rather, they told the Acoustical Society of America meeting in Austin, Tex., that scientific testing of cryogenically freezing 10 trumpets showed minimal differences when the instruments were thawed and played by six musicians. After two years of research, Dr. Chris Rogers, an engineering professor, said that he and colleagues determined that freezing trumpets did not make them sound better.
''One of the great things about studying musical instruments, though, is if the player believes it will make a difference, he or she will play better, so it acts as a sort of placebo,'' Dr. Rogers said.
There has been growing interest among musicians in these treatments for brass instruments of all kind. In experiments, the instruments were cooled with liquid nitrogen to minus 321 degrees Fahrenheit, and then slowly warmed, all in the belief that they would become easier to play. A major flute manufacturer uses the process, and small storefront businesses have popped up for the sole purpose of freezing the instruments.
Chip Jones, a Tufts graduate student involved in the research, said he had recruited six trumpeters ranging in skill from a former high school musician to a New England Conservatory player to member of the Boston Symphony Orchestra.
They played the same sequence on trumpets that had been frozen and those that had not, and then rated the instruments. They were also asked to identify which trumpet matched the sound that ''people say is brighter, freer-blowing or that had more 'presence,' '' Mr. Jones said.
Differences in the answers, he said, were statistically insignificant. ''There was more difference from trumpet to trumpet and from player to player than in the results from treatment of the instruments,'' Mr. Jones said.
The research was requested by Selmer Musical Instruments, a wind instrument manufacturer, which was considering whether to offer the cryogenic treatments for new instruments sold from the Vincent Bach Stradivarius trumpet line. As a result of the tests, the company has decided to forgo the deep-freeze.
But others who have tried the deep-freeze say there is a difference in ease of playing and in the range of ''color'' in the tone.
In Arlington Heights, Ill., Wayne Tanabe, owner of the Brass Bow music repair shop, said his advertising was by word of mouth. ''Otherwise, people think you're talking about voodoo,'' he said.
He has a tub-size cryogenics tank where he can fit a tuba and several trumpets. His freeze technique costs about $200 and takes 35 to 50 hours. As Mr. Tanabe explained it, cryogenics accelerates what seems to happen to brass instruments as they age. Sound quality improves because resonance is clearer, he said.
Mr. Jones said studies had shown that while steel, for example, did undergo change through freezing, brass did not. Heating, by contrast, does soften metal, potentially changing its acoustics.
The trumpet research is part a musical instrument engineering program at Tufts.
The most important meeting of Mets General Manager Jim Duquette's day did not take place in his suite at the Marriott hotel, baseball's winter meetings headquarters on the edge of the French Quarter. Instead, Duquette crossed Canal Street on Friday and walked half a block north to the JW Marriott hotel for an audience with center fielder Mike Cameron and his agent, Mike Nicotera.
Cameron, a former Mariner, is the Mets' primary target at the winter meetings, and Duquette came away from their talk convinced that the Mets still had a shot at him. Cameron, who lives with his family in Atlanta in the off-season, prefers to play on the East Coast. The Mets are alone among his three suitors -- Oakland and San Diego being the others -- in fitting that requirement.
But Duquette did not sweeten the Mets' three-year, $18 million offer, so he hopes geography wins out over money. Acquiring Cameron would improve the Mets' outfield defense.
''He's a guy genuinely interested in playing in New York,'' Duquette said late Friday afternoon. ''Everybody I spoke to about him said he's not the kind of guy who would show interest and not follow through.''
Cameron and Nicotera were not immediately available for comment. Cameron said in Friday's San Francisco Chronicle that he hoped to make a decision by Sunday. Cameron said a report that Oakland offered him $24 million over four years exaggerated the dollar figure.
A two-time Gold Glove winner who hit four home runs in a game in 2002, the 30-year-old Cameron dropped off slightly last year (18 homers, 76 runs batted in) in the worst of his four seasons as a Mariner. Seattle acquired Cameron from Cincinnati in the 2000 deal for Ken Griffey Jr.
''I think we've done what we can, as far as educating him about the organization and trying to convince him to sign here,'' Duquette said. ''My understanding is he has a couple of meetings with the other teams in the next couple of days, and then he'll make a decision.''
Another player who held some interest for the Mets, the former Arizona right-hander Miguel Batista, agreed to a three-year, $13.1 million deal with Toronto. Batista's agent, Martin Arburua, said the Blue Jays pursued Batista more aggressively than the Mets and afforded him a chance to be their No. 2 starter after Roy Halladay, who won 22 games and the American League Cy Young award last season.
''Miguel wasn't going to be slotted in as No. 2 there; they've got three pretty good pitchers there already,'' Arburua said, referring to the Mets' Tom Glavine, Al Leiter and Steve Trachsel. ''He was a higher priority for other teams.''
Duquette said the Mets never made Arburua a formal proposal, and were not willing to match Toronto's offer. Batista agreed to backload his deal to give the Blue Jays payroll flexibility for 2004. He will make $3.6 million next year and $4.75 million the final two years.
Duquette remains in the market for a starter, although he is seeking a less expensive, middle-to-back-of-the-rotation type. The Mets are also still hoping to unload Roger Cedeño here, even if they have to pay the bulk of the $10 million they owe him the next two seasons.
Webster Young, a jazz trumpeter who played with stars like Miles Davis and John Coltrane in the 1950's, died last Saturday. He was 71.
The cause was a brain tumor, his son Dorian said.
Mr. Young had expert tutelage at 10, studying with Louis Armstrong. As a teenager, he jammed with Dizzy Gillespie, earning the nickname Little Diz in Washington-area clubs.
He broke into the modern jazz scene in New York City in the late 1950's, recording several albums. He returned to Washington in the 70's, toured Europe in the 80's and performed regularly at jazz clubs until eight months before his death.
Mr. Young's career peaked in 1957, when he played coronet with Coltrane for the album ''Interplay for Two Trumpets and Two Tenors.''
In addition to his son, of Portland, he is survived by his wife, Gretchen, and two children from his first marriage, John Wardell Young, of Washington, and Terry Ann Powell, of Silver Spring, Md.
New York City officials agreed yesterday to take the extraordinary step of permanently closing an exit ramp off the West Side Highway to accommodate the developer Donald Trump's vision for his $3 billion project on the Upper West Side.
The project, known as Trump Place, is expected to stretch from 59th Street to 72nd Street and include 17 waterfront buildings, 5,700 apartment units, 137,800 feet of retail space and a 21.5-acre park. Several buildings have been finished and tenants have begun moving in.
A key element of Mr. Trump's plan has been the construction of a new north-south throughway, called Riverside Boulevard, that would run parallel to West End Avenue on the east and offer unimpeded passage from Riverside Drive at 72nd Street to 12th Avenue at 59th Street.
To make room for the crucial link at 72nd Street, however, Mr. Trump's plan required the closing of the northbound exit ramp off Route 9A because it was in the way, and yesterday city officials signed off on the closing.
Neighborhood groups and local politicians expressed outrage yesterday at the decision to close the ramp, saying that officials have agreed to redraw the city map to accommodate one person's project. Assemblyman Scott M. Stringer, Congressman Jerrold L. Nadler and City Councilwoman Gale A. Brewer recently met with city officials to lobby against the closing.
''This benefits one individual, Donald Trump,'' said Mr. Stringer, who represents the Upper West Side. ''And the reality is, there is a potential for a traffic nightmare.''
Mr. Trump's complex was approved more than a decade ago, after a protracted struggle. But construction on the project has taken time, as he has fought off lawsuits and community opposition, and when he finally asked last February that he be allowed to proceed with the closing of the exit ramp, the New York City Department of Transportation told him he needed to provide new information to prove that traffic, air quality and other conditions had not changed significantly.
''I was a little surprised when all of a sudden they said, 'Why don't we review this. Maybe we don't want to do it,' '' Mr. Trump said yesterday in a telephone interview. ''This was something that was agreed to, signed and sealed.''
Only a small section of the boulevard has been built, as Mr. Trump has been coordinating roadwork with completion of the buildings. Recently he began working on Building A, which is on 72nd Street and requires the ramp to be closed.
The developer eventually came back with an assessment that conditions had not changed significantly, and city officials took several months to study it. Yesterday, they issued a letter reauthorizing the closing, provided that Mr. Trump redraw the lanes on West End Avenue to include a turning lane. This will help mitigate the extra traffic on the road, before the full length of the boulevard is finally completed in 2012, officials said.
West End Avenue now has two lanes in each direction, and parking lanes on both sides. The street is already wide enough to hold more lanes, officials said. Lines will be repainted so that there will be three lanes in both directions, along with the turning lane. This will probably mean, however, that parking will be prohibited from 7 to 10 a.m. on the southbound side and 4 to 7 p.m. on the northbound side, something that has upset residents.
Residents are afraid the closing of the exit ramp will force extra traffic onto West End Avenue, which they say is already overburdened with vehicles. Residents also have complained that traffic on Route 9A would back up at the next exit to the north, 79th Street, where they say traffic congestion already exists.
''Our streets really can't handle all the automobiles that we have,'' said Dale Brown, a member of the West 79th Street Museum Block Association.
But city officials said their analysis showed that traffic congestion would not worsen significantly after the ramp closing. Only about four cars per minute use the exit during rush hour, said Michael Primeggia, deputy commissioner of traffic operations for the city's Transportation Department.
''In Manhattan, that's a sneeze,'' he said.
In contrast, more than nine cars a minute use sections of busy north-south avenues, he said.
Several community groups had pushed city officials to consider alternative plans that they said would allow the exit ramp to coexist with the completed boulevard, but officials said the plans did not hold up after analysis.
''It seems to me that they're thumbing their noses at the whole west side,'' said Madeleine Polayes, the president of the Coalition for a Livable West Side, one of the groups fighting the closing. ''We'll do what we want to do. We don't have to listen to anybody.''
Beginners hardly ever lead a trump. Experts do so more often, but they pick their spots. One large book has been written on this subject, but it is sufficient to know a few guidelines.
Consider a trump lead if dummy is likely to score ruffs or if other leads seem risky. If defenders are well-stocked with high cards, a trump lead may be appropriate. It was indicated on the diagramed deal from the board-a-match teams at the New York Winter Regional Championships last month and was reported by Michael Radin, who held the East cards.
The bidding started quietly with one diamond from South and a takeout double from West. North's one-spade bid required partnership agreement. Traditionally this was nonforcing, indicated a five-card suit and denied the high-card strength to redouble.
In the modern style, used here, it suggested a hand that would have responded one spade in the absence of a double. It was therefore forcing, with a four-card suit possible and no strength limitation.
East should usually double in this situation with four cards or more in the suit bid on his right. This is partly because the partnership might wish to play in that strain, and partly because it might expose a psychic.
South then unmasked his batteries with an abrupt leap to five diamonds. Radin doubled this on the theory that his eight high-card points and his partner's promised values should provide enough defense.
The opening lead was now crucial. South had eight trump tricks plus two aces. With any plain-suit lead he would be able to maneuver a heart ruff in the dummy. But Susan Wexler, one of the country's best female players, chose the diamond queen with the West cards. It seemed unlikely that any side-suit defensive tricks would escape if they were not taken immediately.
The declarer won the first trick with the ace, and realized that an immediate heart lead would make the defense easy: Either defender would be able to win and play a second trump. He therefore crossed to the spade ace and called for the heart five, a good play. He planned a duck that would give West the lead. That player was unlikely to have the missing trump, because the normal lead with a doubleton queen would have been the low card.
Unfortunately for South, Radin alertly produced his jack, dooming the contract. The declarer won with the ace and continued with the deuce. East was now able to take his queen and play his diamond five. South was stuck with the nine-seven of hearts, and eventually had to lose two tricks to West's king-eight.
The defense had to be exactly right, starting with a trump lead, to allow West's heart eight to demonstrate its power and defeat the game.
To the Editor:
As a Metropolitan Opera violinist who for the last three seasons has been sitting directly in front of the brass section, I must disagree with the assertion by Susan Welty of the Atlanta Symphony Orchestra that the trombones are the worst destroyers of a musician's hearing. For me, the most potent weapons of mass aural destruction are the higher-pitched trumpets, especially when blasting a fortissimo passage fortified by the overtones from the French horns and, I must reluctantly add, the poor maligned trombones.

One week was enough for NBC to stand by and watch as ''The Apprentice,'' its promising new reality series featuring Donald J. Trump, was pummeled in the ratings Wednesday night by ''American Idol'' on the Fox network.
Not wanting to risk losing one of its few new potential hit series to the ''American Idol'' juggernaut, NBC moved yesterday to shift ''The Apprentice'' back to Thursday, revamping that night and Tuesday as well.
Starting next week, NBC's Thursday night lineup will be ''Friends'' at 8, ''Will and Grace'' at 8:30, ''The Apprentice'' at 9 and ''E.R.'' at 10.
NBC will move the comedy ''Scrubs'' from Thursday to Tuesday at 9:30, after ''Frasier.'' The comedy ''Whoopi'' moves back to 8 followed by ''Happy Family'' at 8:30. NBC will concede the Wednesday at 8 spot to ''American Idol'' by filling it with repeats of ''The Apprentice.''
''The Apprentice'' made its debut earlier this month on Thursday night, and in its first two weeks it drew 18.5 million viewers and 20.2 million viewers. But on its regular Wednesday night slot this week it drew just 12.3 million viewers against the 29.4 million viewers of ''American Idol,'' which began its new season this week.
It required a blend of mental strength, fancy footwork and inconsistency on the other side of the net, but Justine Henin-Hardenne reached the semifinals of the Australian Open on Tuesday with a 7-5, 6-3 victory over Lindsay Davenport.
A year ago, in the fourth round here, Henin-Hardenne punched through her reputation for fragility and set the tone for her phenomenal season by rallying from a 1-4 deficit in the final set to beat Davenport.
This year, Henin-Hardenne came into their rematch seeded first and quickly found herself down again. After just 10 minutes of play, she trailed by 0-4, as if she had been unprepared for Davenport's trademark mix of power and depth. But with the help of her most spectacular shot -- the one-handed backhand -- she ripped enough winners in Davenport's next service game to put herself back in the flow of the match.
''I understand then that if I kept fighting on every point, the match could turn,'' Henin-Hardenne said.
It was 4-3 before Davenport regained control by breaking Henin-Hardenne's serve to go up, 5-3. But Davenport, after two seasons of fighting injuries, is no longer the confident front-runner she was earlier in her career.
The last time she was in a Grand Slam final was in 2000, and both she and Henin-Hardenne knew that the winner of the match would be an overwhelming favorite to reach the final -- with 32nd-seeded Fabiola Zuluaga of Colombia the semifinal opponent.
Davenport could not close out the set, losing her serve at 5-3, then squandering three set points in the next game after taking a 0-40 lead on Henin-Hardenne's serve.
''I wanted to play like I was going for it on those points,'' Davenport, seeded fifth, said. ''It just didn't happen today.''
Henin-Hardenne, a Belgian, has not been at her best here, playing spectacular tennis only in bursts. But the quality of her court coverage has remained remarkable. Instead of spending the off-season celebrating her No. 1 ranking and two Grand Slam singles titles in 2003, she clearly spent it training hard.
Now, perhaps, comes the reward. She expected to face Amélie Mauresmo in the semifinals, but Mauresmo was forced to withdraw with a torn back muscle less than an hour before she was scheduled to play. The beneficiary was Zuluaga, a 25-year-old who trained at Nick Bollettieri's Tennis Academy in Florida for three years as a teenager but who, until this tournament, was well known only in her country.
Before she arrived in Melbourne, no Colombian had advanced past the third round of a Grand Slam tournament, but Colombia now has a semifinalist. ''It feels good, but I didn't want it to be for the first time this way,'' Zuluaga said.
Mauresmo, a finalist here in 1999, was seeded fourth here and was one of the favorites for the title. But in the fourth game of her 7-5, 7-5 victory over Alicia Molik on Sunday, she said she felt something go awry in her back as she hit a backhand. She finished the match with no apparent discomfort, but a magnetic resonance imaging scan later revealed that she had a half-inch tear in a muscle on the left side of her back.
She was still not prepared to default, and she went out on Rod Laver Arena to practice at 9:30 a.m. Tuesday with her coach, Loic Courteau. But she was soon slumped in a courtside chair in tears and later began crying again at a news conference, burying her face in her hands for an extended period before continuing to answer questions.
''There is the pain, and there is also the risk of making it worse,'' she said. ''It's a big disappointment and a huge frustration.''
It is hardly the first such setback of her career. A series of injuries has kept her off the circuit for extended periods, the most recent a strained rib muscle that forced her to withdraw from Wimbledon last year. In light of the injury-depleted field and her own form, her chances here were excellent.
''I think I had a great opportunity,'' said Mauresmo, who is uncertain how long her latest injury will keep her off the circuit. ''I know I will be able to get over this. I will do all I need to do to get back.''
MATCH POINTS
The Australia Day celebration Monday did not end happily for the last two Australians in the singles draw. The unseeded Moroccan HICHAM ARAZI was at his best against MARK PHILIPPOUSSIS, winning 6-2, 6-2, 6-4. ROGER FEDERER, seeded second, disposed of 15th-seeded LLEYTON HEWITT, 4-6, 6-3, 6-1, 6-4. Federer and Hewitt played on this court in the decisive match of last year's Davis Cup semifinal between Australia and Switzerland. Hewitt rallied from two sets and 3-5 down to win. ''I'm very, very happy to have taken my revenge,'' Federer said. ''It hurt me big-time that match.''
Donald Trump says his private real estate development company is the biggest in Manhattan. His reality television show, ''The Apprentice,'' has blockbuster ratings nationwide. Now Mr. Trump seems to have even bolder plans for his public company, Trump Hotels and Casino Resorts -- even though it is burdened with $1.8 billion in debt. Mr. Trump says the company will go global as soon as it completes a major refinancing effort that was announced on Thursday.
The refinancing plans are very preliminary, but they include a $400 million equity investment from Credit Suisse First Boston, which will replace Mr. Trump as the company's majority shareholder. Mr. Trump, who will remain as the company's chairman, said the investment would reduce Trump Hotels' debt load on its Atlantic City properties and free up capital.
The company now owns just three casino hotels, all in Atlantic City, and a riverboat casino in Indiana, but Mr. Trump plans to build new towers for the Trump Plaza and the Trump Taj Mahal, and possibly expand abroad. Of course, there is no guarantee that the deal will go through, in part because it is contingent on bondholders taking a discount on their notes.
But it wasn't too early for Mr. Trump, in anticipation of the cash influx, to announce plans to change the company's name to Trump International.
''We have the hottest brand in the world -- you can see this by the television show -- and this will allow us to take advantage of it,'' he said. Also, he noted: ''We just thought it was a bigger name. I was never a fan of the other.''
While Mr. Trump may have international visions, many on Wall Street think that for now he should have his eyes glued to the bottom line since the company is now in the red. Eric Dash
THEY may be big and powerful. They may even get to dictate what kinds of flowers residents can plant by the front door. But, according to a ruling by the New Jersey Superior Court last week, homeowners associations are not governments.
And that is a good thing, according to representatives of the Twin Rivers Homeowners Association in East Windsor. In the court case, the association beat back a challenge by dissident residents and the American Civil Liberties Union that sought to declare it a quasi-municipal agency, subject to the same Constitutional restraints that govern towns and school boards.
''The issue here is whether a private community, a private association, has the right to regulate itself without interference from groups like the A.C.L.U.,'' said Barry S. Goodman, the lawyer who represented the homeowners association. ''This is a vindication for Twin Rivers.''
The case, Committee for a Better Twin Rivers v. Twin Rivers Homeowners Association, was the first in New Jersey to argue that homeowners associations, which often have the power to regulate architectural details and property use, also have some of the same responsibilities that governments have regarding record-keeping and oversight. With one in six Americans living on property governed by some form of association, A.C.L.U. lawyers argued that associations like Twin Rivers had adopted some of the functions of local government, becoming quasi-municipalities.
But a Superior Court judge in Mercer County disagreed, ruling that homeowners associations do not have to conform to rules governing municipalities, even if they provide municipal services like clearing snow. ''Private organizations, even when they perform municipal functions, do not become quasi-municipal agents,'' Judge Neil H. Shuster wrote in an 80-page decision filed on Tuesday.
Frank Askin, the lawyer for the Committee for a Better Twin Rivers, said the plaintiffs planned to appeal. He said that in similar cases, the New Jersey Supreme Court has found that ''individual rights take precedent, they trump property rights.''
''This is the end of the regular season,'' Mr. Askin said. ''We are now in the playoffs. The appellate courts will decide this case.''
The case began in December 2000, when a group of the development's residents formed the Committee for a Better Twin Rivers and sued the homeowners association. They challenged some of its rules, including those that governed the placing of campaign signs on property and access to the association's financial records. They argued that the homeowners association had failed to balance their individual rights against the association's right to regulate behavior within the development.
In many ways, Twin Rivers does look like a town. With 10,000 residents, the 1970's-era development has a larger population than roughly two-thirds of New Jersey's municipalities, and it provides some services that are municipal in nature, like running a community center and picking up garbage.
''Twin Rivers exercises a lot of governmental powers over people,'' Mr. Askin said. ''They tax them, they control zoning regulations, they control a lot of aspects of their lives.''
Mr. Askin argued that with that authority came the responsibility ''to act in a way that accommodates and acknowledges individual rights.''
But representatives of the homeowners association argued that it is a private group, governed by contracts signed by residents when they buy property. For example, they said, all homeowners must abide by rules that govern placement of signs on their property: they cannot violate these rules and then claim to be exercising their right of free speech. For the most part, Judge Shuster agreed with the homeowners association. He found that its rules are part of the contract signed by residents, and that it does not constitute a form of government.
He wrote that the association ''does have considerable impact on the lives of residents in the Twin Rivers community.''
But he also wrote: ''This impact is a function of the contractual relationship that residents choose when they elect to purchase property or live in Twin Rivers -- its burdens come with concomitant benefits.'' Mr. Goodman, the lawyer for the homeowners association, said the A.C.L.U. had been trying ''to stretch the Constitution.''
''I think the court appropriately found the board has acted properly in creating certain regulations to deal with the 10,000 people who live there,'' he said.
The court's ruling, he said, held that ''the rules and regulations of Twin Rivers are reasonable and appropriate and they apply to everybody equally.''
''This is not a Constitutional issue,'' he added.
QUIETLY and largely outside the limelight turned on American fortunes in Iraq, European diplomats have been maneuvering in recent months to avert crises, cajole rogue leaders or urge reconciliation, from Iran and Syria to Libya and Cyprus. In these places, the Europeans are working in the same direction -- if not with the same tactics -- as the Americans.
This is in marked contrast to a year ago, when Germany and France bitterly disputed the American invasion of Iraq with British support. Last week, for example, Europeans were exerting a significant pull in the attempt by the United Nations secretary general, Kofi Annan, to broker an effort to reunify Cyprus, long divided into Greek and Turkish sectors. Turkey wants to join the European Union, and the union's members have made Turkish cooperation over Cyprus -- before the island itself joins on May 1 -- part of the price for Europe's good will.
In December, Britain helped the diplomacy that led Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi to offer to rid Libya of outlawed weapons. There has been talk, too, of the Europeans trying to persuade Syria to take similar steps in return for a trade deal, thereby easing some pressure it feels from 100,000 American soldiers next door in Iraq.
And last October, the British, French and German foreign ministers struck a deal with Iran aimed at halting its covert nuclear weapons work and defusing a confrontation between Iran and the United States. The Europeans offered a trade-off: agree to inspections and suspend uranium enrichment, in return for future access to civilian nuclear technology. ''Talk softly, and carry a big carrot,'' was how a British diplomat defined his country's notion of ''soft power.'' That view was echoed by a European official in Brussels. ''Although you can say that the real work is done by the hard cop,'' he said, ''the soft cop has a role to play as well.''
European diplomacy, nonetheless, often remains at odds with itself, because France, Germany and Britain still conduct their own foreign policies. The big three in turn are sometimes resented by other Europeans, as when Italy and Spain complained of being excluded when the British, French and German leaders met in Berlin last week on the coming enlargement of the European Union.
The emphasis on working together in ways that do not openly conflict with the United States seems driven in part by lessons from last year's passions over Iraq: The division Europe can afford has a limit. ''France and Germany have worked out that they cannot lead Europe's foreign and defense policy without British input,'' Charles Grant, director of the Center for European Reform, a London research group, said. ''And Tony Blair has worked out that he cannot fulfill British objectives in Europe without working with France and Germany.''
That recognition is all the more urgent since the European Union is about to expand from 15 to 25 members. Some diplomats say that without some big-power leadership, the union will bog down under its new weight and colliding visions of national interest.
Even as they strive for many of the same goals in the Middle East and elsewhere, Europe and the United States remain divided on a central calculation. For the Europeans, the region's problems will not be solved until the Palestinians and Israel are persuaded to make peace; the only power able to exert the required pressure is the United States, but the Bush administration does not seem to agree that everything else depends on settling the Arab-Israeli dispute first. Nevertheless, some diplomats say that even on this issue the gap is narrowing, and that Washington is now showing some interest in how Europeans might start new conversations among parties in the Middle East.
After a confrontation with Iran was defused, The Guardian, the British newspaper, exulted, ''America wields only a big stick these days, but the old continent believes in a combination of little sticks and juicy carrots.'' In the end, though, that strategy depends on a muscular United States looming offstage, and the Europeans seem to be coming a bit more to terms with that reality.
For all that, Europe's diplomacy remains diffuse. Javier Solana, the former NATO secretary general who is now the European Union's top foreign policy official, was not a party to the talks in Iran in October, meaning that the Europe beyond the troika of France, Germany and Britain felt excluded.
Neither is Europe ready to fall in line with American thinking. In a new security doctrine, the European Union generally shares Washington's views of the perils of terrorism and the proliferation of unconventional weapons, but pointedly avoids support for military pre-emption in favor of ''preventive engagement,'' encompassing ''political, diplomatic, military and civilian, trade and development activities.''
Yet this is a grouping with a long history of splintered visions among its 380 million people (about to be expanded to 450 million). Britain's intervention in Libya, for instance, unfolded in concert with the United States, not with its European partners. France has always sought a preferred position as a former power in Lebanon and Syria, complicating the effort to pressure Syria. The German foreign minister, Joschka Fischer, has sought to take a lead in the Israel-Palestinian conflict, building on close ties to both sides. As for military cooperation in the European Union, France and Britain have dominated.
''This is a complicated story,'' the European official said, ''and it does not go in a straight line.''
Sam Solovey's unorthodox business plans on ''The Apprentice,'' the NBC reality show, led Donald Trump to fire him. But now Mr. Solovey, who tried unsuccessfully to sell a glass of lemonade for $1,000 on the show, is trying to parlay his pink slip into a new job: management guru.
Mr. Solovey, 28, of Chevy Chase, Md., is hoping to speak at team-building seminars and corporate functions, giving lessons on how to start a business and on the importance of relationships.
If his antics on ''The Apprentice'' were any indication, his talks might be titled ''How to Lose Friends and Alienate People.'' (He angered virtually all of his teammates on the show by sleeping through tasks and proposing outlandish ideas, like the expensive lemonade.)
But Mr. Solovey, who is asking for $2,000 to $3,000 a speech, promises more useful advice. ''Although I behaved in a certain way on the show, I actually don't function like that on a regular basis,'' he said.
Still, he has no plans to quit his day job soon. He is the director of sales and business operations at Potomac Tech Wire, a regional business news service with 80,000 subscribers; he was one of its co-founders.
Mr. Trump, who dismisses one contestant a week from the series, booted Mr. Solovey in January. Since then, Mr. Solovey has lined up some conference engagements and has appeared on ''The Tonight Show'' and ''Today.'' Even his former boss says he would hire him back -- at least, to speak.
''I think Sam would be terrific at motivating the people,'' Mr. Trump said. ''Sam has a lot to learn, but he also has a lot to teach.'' Eric Dash
In the aftermath of its national election, Spain, along with the rest of the world, is struggling to answer a harrowing question: who really won on Sunday, the Socialists or the terrorists?
For the departing foreign minister, Ana Palacio, whose center-right government staunchly supported the American-led war in Iraq and lost the election, the answer is clear. ''We are giving birth to a new world, and it is sad and dangerous and sick,'' Mrs. Palacio said in an interview. ''We are giving a signal to terrorists that they can have their way because we have given in.''
For José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero, the Socialist who will soon become the next prime minister, the answer is far different. Asked at a news conference on Monday whether terrorist bombs had catapulted him to power, Mr. Zapatero said nothing could be further from the truth.
''Spaniards have always expressed great maturity and common sense at the time of voting,'' he said, emphasizing each word. ''There was a desire for change because there was a government that had done bad things. And on Sunday, the people voted for change.''
The reverberations from the ballot box here have been felt around the world. Spain, with Britain, had embraced the American war effort in Iraq, despite widespread popular opposition. The Madrid bombings raised the possibility that Europe was a fresh target for violence and that terrorists could undermine democracy and manipulate elections.
In Washington, President Bush tried to dispel the notion that the Spanish election would lead other European nations to seek distance from Washington's approach to terrorism and Iraq. During a meeting with the Dutch prime minister, Jan Peter Balkenende, Mr. Bush asked the Dutch people -- and by extension other Europeans -- to think hard before they followed any impulse to pull their troops out of Iraq.
''I would ask them to think about the Iraqi citizens, who don't want people to withdraw, because they want to be free,'' Mr. Bush said. ''And I would remind the Dutch citizens that Al Qaeda has an interest in Iraq for a reason.'' He added, ''They realize this is a front in the war on terror, and they fear the spread of freedom and democracy in places like the greater Middle East.''
The contest in Spain had always been close between the governing Popular Party, which backed Mr. Bush's policies, and the Socialists, who opposed them. Other issues at stake before the bombings were unemployment, a housing shortage, women's rights and social benefits.
In March 2003, at the height of opposition to the Iraq war, the Socialists were ahead in polls. With the economy roaring and the Socialist Party in disarray, the Popular Party pulled ahead. On March 7, the last date in which polls were published, an Opina poll showed that the gap had narrowed, giving the Popular Party 42 percent, compared with 38 percent for the Socialists.
Four days later, terror struck. With Madrid under siege, voters were expected to rally around the flag and stick with the party that had talked the toughest against terrorism, at least initially. Even the Socialists braced themselves for that outcome, said two senior party officials.
But interviews with scores of Spaniards of both parties indicated that a number of things happened after the attacks that shifted the balance to the Socialists. Voters flooded the polls on Sunday in record numbers, especially young people who had not planned to vote. In interviews, they said they did so not so much out of fear of terror as out of anger against a government they saw as increasingly authoritarian, arrogant and stubborn. The government, they said, mishandled the crisis in the emotional days after the attacks.
Voters said they were enraged not only by the government's insistence that the Basque separatist group ETA was responsible, despite mounting evidence to the contrary, but they also resented its clumsy attempts to quell antigovernment sentiment.
For example, the main television channel TVE, which is state-owned, showed scant and selective scenes of antigovernment demonstrations on Saturday night, just as it ran very little coverage of the large demonstrations against the war in Iraq last year. It also suddenly changed its regular programming to air a documentary on the horrors of ETA.
That was the last straw for some Spaniards, who said it evoked the nightmare of censorship during the Franco dictatorship little more than a quarter of a century ago.
Prime Minister José María Aznar personally called the top editors of Spain's major dailies twice on the day of the attacks. In the first round of calls, Mr. Aznar said he was convinced that ETA was responsible.
''He said, 'It was ETA, Antonio, don't doubt it in the least,' '' said Antonio Franco, editor in chief of the Barcelona-based El Periódico de Catalunya, in an interview.
Mr. Franco's newspaper published a special edition based on Mr. Aznar's call, then Mr. Franco published an editorial rectifying the mistake as new information came to light. ''It was shameful to me that the whole world was taking precautions and debating about Al Qaeda except in Spain, where the attack occurred,'' he said.
At the Spanish news agency EFE, Alfonso Bauluz, a correspondent and member of the agency's union, said, ''I received information from my colleagues, who have good sources, about the Al Qaeda hypothesis, but the editor said we don't want that, don't pay attention. On Saturday, the editor wrote a story with his own byline saying all possibilities of an Al Qaeda connection were thrown out.''
During Mr. Aznar's second call that evening, he acknowledged that other avenues were being investigated, but discounted them, Mr. Franco said.
Meanwhile, within 24 hours of the terrorist attacks, the Socialists, through their own intelligence and diplomatic contacts in the Muslim world, were already leaning toward the theory that Al Qaeda and not ETA was responsible, two senior Socialist Party officials said.
Spaniards are still struggling to absorb both the shock of the terror attacks and interpret the result of the upset election on Sunday.
''The terrorism attack has changed the result of the election, but the people were also deceived by the government, so it's a combination, a mix of the two of things,'' said Elena Roldán, a 28-year-old law librarian who voted Socialist.
Asked whether she felt the United States bore some responsibility for encouraging Spain to join its war against Iraq, she replied, ''Nobody forced Aznar to go to war; the entire country was against it. Nobody has been saying that the United States was responsible for this attack, but everybody holds the Spanish government responsible.''
At the bus and train terminal at Plaza de la Castilla in northern Madrid, Alberto Martín, a 31-year-old nuclear physicist who voted Socialist, said, ''If the government had said, 'We don't know who did it,' nothing would have happened and Zapatero would not be there. Aznar was making decisions without any consideration for people's concerns. Look at the war in Iraq. Aznar thought he was God! There was no dialogue.''
The election, Mr. Martín added, ''is a victory for the people, not for terrorism. You see, I'm now going to take the train.''
The tourists position themselves in front of Trump Tower on Fifth Avenue between 56th and 57th Streets. They strike a pose that, to the uninitiated, might seem an awkward gesture. They extend one hand, sideways, and scream, ''You're fired!''
The visitors are, of course, mimicking Donald Trump's now-famous line from his reality television show, ''The Apprentice.'' And thanks to its role on the program, in which would-be executives compete for the chance to work for Mr. Trump, Trump Tower has become one of the most sought-after photo ops in town.
''I had to see Trump Tower,'' said Daphne Cross, a 38-year-old executive assistant from Seattle. ''It's just as much of an icon in this city to me as the Empire State Building. If you watch the show at all, you'd have to come see it.''
Before walking away, she waved a red-gloved hand in the air, mimicking Mr. Trump's method of dismissing fallen cast members.
Brittany Buza and three of her friends also struck the pointy-finger pose in front of Trump Tower yesterday, smiling as they loudly fired no one in particular.
''He does it on the show; I thought it would be kind of funny,'' Brittany, 14, said.
Pictures aside, the girls, and Brittany in particular, were really there to look for the Donald.
''She wants to date him,'' her friend Sarah Jane Holmes said. Brittany burst into giggles, but did not play down her affection.
''Yeah, he's hot,'' she said.
Alas, Mr. Trump was not there. He was at Barnes & Noble on Broadway at 66th Street, where he signed more than 1,000 copies of his new book, ''How to Get Rich.''
Not to worry. Visitors to Trump Tower can always ''see'' him. This month, he had a 25-foot-by-13-foot banner with a picture of himself installed across the front of the building. He said the sign, on which the words ''You're Fired'' appear in bold white letters, was his version of a thank-you letter, ''a love note to New York.''
Being a famous developer is one thing. Being a television star is another. Mr. Trump says he is having difficulty moving about town without being mobbed.
''I've always thought I was hot,'' he said, ''but there's never been anything like this. This is a different level of heat.''
Eagle-eyed tourists at Trump Tower yesterday did get a chance to see at least one ''Apprentice'' cast member. George, one of Mr. Trump's aides, who evaluates contestants as they compete, strode purposefully out of the building, careful not to break stride as tourists shrieked in recognition.
''Did you see that?'' said Carmene Price, an Orange County, Calif., resident who was visiting the city with her daughters. ''He did give half a smile.''
More discerning fans noticed that there was something familiar about the doorman. He's Jimmy Devivo, 35, the elevator operator who takes cast members who have sidestepped Mr. Trump's boardroom wrath back up to the suites.
''When the doors open, I'm the guy on the left-hand side of the elevator,'' Mr. Devivo said. ''You can't miss me. I'm the guy in the tuxedo.''
Aside from his doorman duties, Mr. Devivo has been coaching tourists on how to evoke a guttural ''You're fired,'' or ''Meet me in the boardroom,'' another of Mr. Trump's catchphrases from the show. And Mr. Devivo gives lessons on the finger-point. The trick, he advises, is to use the entire right hand, not just a single finger.
Becky Buckland, who works in auto sales in Kettering, England, has never seen the television program, but snapped a picture of the building because she has heard of Mr. Trump.
''Isn't his wife Ivana got lots of pairs of shoes, or is that Imelda Marcos?'' asked Ms. Buckland, 29. Her description of the building's facade was more pointed.
''It's a bit bling bling, isn't it?'' she asked.
At least one group of tourists, from Alabama, was unfazed by Trump Tower or its namesake. Trump Tower is, after all, a shopping mall, so as their chartered bus idled in front of the building, they hurried inside -- to use the bathroom.
In the 1990's, Donald Trump snatched up hundreds of acres of land in Westchester and Putnam Counties with visions of building four gilded golf courses. One was built: the Trump National Golf Club in Briarcliff Manor, famed for its over-the-top 13th hole, featuring a 101-foot black granite waterfall.
Two others, in Yorktown and Putnam Valley, were withdrawn during arduous environmental reviews. And this week, Mr. Trump said he would drop the last proposal for a golf course, on land in Westchester that straddles the towns of Bedford, North Castle and New Castle -- 213 acres that once belonged to Eugene Meyer, former publisher of The Washington Post.
Instead, Mr. Trump has proposed to build 15 estate homes on parcels ranging from 4 to 19 acres, each with a pool and a tennis court and priced from $10 million to $30 million. The stately 38,000-square-foot house on the Seven Springs estate, where Katharine Graham, the former Post publisher and Mr. Meyer's daughter, spent her childhood, will be sold, as will another house on the property.
''We're going to build super-high-end residential, the likes of which has never been seen on the East Coast,'' said Mr. Trump, adding that he would dust off the golf course plan if he did not win swift approval for the housing.
Mr. Trump said community opposition did not force him to abandon the golf course idea. Indeed, he was moving forward in the lengthy environmental review process. In September, a state administrative law judge gave him permission to build two holes of his golf course in order to test an absorption system to capture runoff. That decision is being appealed by Bedford and the village of Mount Kisco.
Mr. Trump said members of the community had approached him about pursuing a development of large estates, a plan he believes will be more profitable than a golf course. Mr. Trump bought the land in 1995 for $7.5 million, and it has since ballooned in value, he said. ''The site has become too valuable for a golf course,'' he said, adding that it would only compete with his course in Briarcliff Manor.
Residents and officials who opposed the golf course on environmental grounds embraced the shift in plans. Mount Kisco was especially concerned about the golf course, arguing that chemical runoff would imperil Byram Lake reservoir, the village's sole source of drinking water. The reservoir is owned by Mount Kisco, but is in Bedford and North Castle next to the Trump land.
Mount Kisco has no regulatory authority over the Trump property since it lies outside the village's borders. But the village had hired lawyers and engineering consultants to fight the golf course proposal.
''It's a win-win situation for all of us, especially for the village of Mount Kisco,'' said J. Michael Cindrich, the village mayor. ''The housing will have significantly less of an impact on our watershed area.''
A lawyer for North Castle, Roland A. Baroni, also praised the new plan, particularly the low density, as the site could accommodate more houses than Mr. Trump is proposing. In the past, he had floated a plan for 46 single-family houses as an alternative to a golf course.
''He's proposing nine large residential lots in North Castle, and there's very little environmental disturbance,'' Mr. Baroni said. ''It protects the Mount Kisco water supply, and it avoids a potential controversy with our neighbor that we did not want to have. So we're very pleased with the change.''
Local officials said the new plan would preserve the many stone walls on the Seven Springs estate and leave the contours of the land intact. ''If the housing plan goes through, thousands and thousands of trees will not have to be cut down,'' Mr. Cindrich said.
Donald Trump, the real estate magnate, has shelved plans for a luxury 18-hole golf course at Seven Springs in favor of building multimillion dollar-estates on the 213-acre property, a move viewed as posing a lesser threat to Mount Kisco's drinking water.
In a telephone interview, Mr. Trump said his decision to change direction was based on the success of the Trump National Golf Club, which opened in Briarcliff Manor in 2002.
''I began to realize I can't top it,'' he said.
Then some people came to him and asked him to reconsider his decision at Seven Springs, where there were fears that fertilizer runoff would foul Byram Lake, a reservoir in Mount Kisco.
In response, Mr. Trump unveiled his most recent proposal, replacing manicured greens and lush fairways with 17 mansions, which are expected to sell for $15 million to $25 million each. They will be on lots of 4 to 19 acres and will include swimming pools and tennis courts.
''This will be great, and if this doesn't happen quickly I will build a golf course,'' Mr. Trump said, noting that he had the necessary approvals. Barbara Whitaker
IT was another stupendous week for that pop culture sensation, Donald J. Trump. On Thursday, his hit reality television show, ''The Apprentice,'' continued to rack up huge ratings as it neared its nail-biting conclusion. Two days earlier, immediately after its release, his slight new book, ''How to Get Rich,'' popped up to 10th place on the best-seller list of Amazon.com, offering students of wealth invaluable nuggets like Business Rule No. 1: ''If you don't tell people about your success, they probably won't know about it.''
Mr. Trump, of course, has never been shy about discussing his own success. In an interview, he boasted that ''in prime-time television, I'm the highest-paid person.''
More than Oprah? ''Oprah's not prime time,'' he shot back.
More than Larry King? ''Yeah, and Larry King is cable.''
More than the ''Friends'' cast? Well, collectively, no, he acknowledged. But individually, yes.
Mr. Trump's young television apprentices spent last Thursday evening in what he described then as ''the No.1 hotel'' in Atlantic City, the Trump Taj Mahal, vying to lure gamblers into the casino.
In reality, the Taj Mahal needs all the help it can get -- as does the rest of Mr. Trump's increasingly troubled gambling empire. His casino holdings are mired in nearly $2 billion of bond debt that they are struggling to repay. They are aging and overshadowed by flashier competitors, and their revenue and profits have been slumping over the last year.
While the winner of ''The Apprentice'' will get the ''dream job of a lifetime'' -- a year at Mr. Trump's feet, absorbing even more of his business expertise -- the master himself now faces an unwieldy group of investors who are muttering a word that has repeatedly hounded him during his career as a real estate developer and casino mogul: bankruptcy.
Trump Hotels recently began talks with major creditors to address its suffocating debt burden. Asked about the possibility that bondholders may force Trump Hotels and Casino Resorts into a prepackaged bankruptcy proceeding, which some of them privately say they are considering if other efforts fail to corral the debt, Mr. Trump is quick to distance himself from any personal financial liability.
''This has nothing to do with me,'' he said, even though he is chairman and chief executive of the company that bears his name and uses his initials, DJT, as its ticker symbol. ''This has to do with a company in which I'm a major shareholder.''
Trump Hotels has a market capitalization of about $102 million, so Mr. Trump's 49 percent equity stake is worth about $50 million. But should that leaning tower of bond debt tip the entire enterprise into bankruptcy court, Mr. Trump's stock could be worth much less. Nothing, perhaps.
TO be sure, Mr. Trump's representatives could reach a deal with bondholders and avert a bankruptcy filing. Last month, Trump Hotels announced that Credit Suisse First Boston was willing to inject $400 million in fresh funds into the company in exchange for a controlling stake. Although bondholders would have to swallow a significant discount on their investment, some say they take comfort in the fact that a bank, and not Mr. Trump, would be overseeing the company's coffers.
Should bondholders accept that deal, it would eliminate a hefty portion of the debt, leave Mr. Trump with only a 20 percent stake in the new company -- which would be called Trump International even though it currently has no overseas operations -- and flick Mr. Trump from the chief executive's perch. He would retain the title of chairman and would continue promoting his namesake operation.
''There is more of a gun to his head'' now than when Mr. Trump dealt with creditors in past years, said one bondholder.
Although Mr. Trump has long had contentious relations with his creditors, sometimes threatening to withhold interest payments, both sides say tempers have cooled in recent weeks. Mr. Trump and New Jersey gambling regulators said they were confident that the company would be able to make two interest payments of about $73.1 million each that come due in May and November, though Trump Hotels has indicated in public filings that it will need to take advantage of a 30-day grace period to make the May payment on time.
Even so, it will continue to be a tight squeeze. The company, which has published only unaudited financial statements for last year, carries $1.8 billion worth of debt on its balance sheet. Its bond payments are so burdensome that its annual interest expense of $228.5 million last year wiped out its operating income of $139.4 million, contributing to a $87.3 million loss for the year.
Losses are not new to Mr. Trump's company. It has not posted an annual profit since it went public in 1995. It also ran afoul of the Securities and Exchange Commission in 2002, when the regulatory agency slapped Trump Hotels with a cease-and-desist order for producing ''misleading'' financial statements in an earlier quarter. And Trump Hotels' cash flow is so anemic that Mr. Trump, who has routinely extracted millions of dollars in management fees and other perks like a corporate jet from the struggling enterprise, did not take home a bonus last year.
Bond rating agencies downgraded Trump Hotels' debt last month. If a debt restructuring does not happen soon, analysts say, the company's financial picture may become bleaker. ''You have to understand The Donald's psyche. He is really giving up total control here for a serious infusion of cash,'' said Marvin Roffman, a casino analyst who has had a long history of heated disputes with Mr. Trump. ''The company has real problems. For him to let go is a sign that he is throwing in the towel.''
Of course, Mr. Trump is known to wage war when he negotiates, and he said last week that he was prepared to counterattack if bondholders became combative about a restructuring. ''We're talking about a fight that takes years,'' Mr. Trump warned, noting that such a financial battle ''would ruin the business.''
''I don't think anybody would want that to happen,'' he added.
PEOPLE close to the debt negotiations said Mr. Trump had not been leading the talks. That task, they said, has fallen to Scott C. Butera, Trump Hotels' executive vice president. In an interview last week, Mr. Butera said the company had no plans to file for bankruptcy protection, but he acknowledged the hazards of navigating a clear course in negotiations that involve about 20 important groups of bondholders, among them Oak Tree Capital, Putnam Investments, Trust Company of the West and Loews.
''Talking to bondholders is like herding cats, but I think that they're finally speaking with one voice,'' Mr. Butera said. ''I think we'll always be able to make our debt payments but I'm concerned about more than that. You don't want to be sitting around clipping coupons and watching the property deteriorate.''
Some bondholders, none of whom would speak for attribution, describe the Trump Hotels situation as more dire. They say the company is desperate for cash and needs to get its house in order as quickly as possible.
''It's not really a question of 'Why now?''' one bondholder said. ''It's 'How much longer can you afford to wait?' Every day that passes, Trump falls further behind the competition.''
Mr. Trump said his casino holdings amounted to only about 3 percent of his net worth, which, using his estimate, would thus be about $1.6 billion. But Mr. Trump's overall holdings are hard to assess and possibly are worth much less than that. Since the mid-1980's, the twin pillars of his wealth have been real estate, largely concentrated in New York, and casinos, largely concentrated in Atlantic City.
His real estate holdings, which are not threatened by any casino bankruptcy, are privately held. Most press accounts of their value have relied on Mr. Trump's own estimates. Asked to list properties in New York in which he has a 100 percent stake, Mr. Trump mentioned 40 Wall Street and ''many things,'' but declined to be more specific. He has developed new high-rise buildings elsewhere in the city, most notably in the West Side yards. But many of those deals involved other people -- particularly a well-heeled group of Chinese investors -- who back Mr. Trump in exchange for his management of the property, complex profit-sharing arrangements and his name on the door.
Still, last week, Mr. Trump called himself the ''biggest real estate developer in New York,'' a description some competitors have disputed.
''He's a dear friend of mine, but it wouldn't be accurate for him to say that,'' said Richard S. LeFrak, scion of one of New York's most active real estate families. Mr. LeFrak said his family owns the most residential units in New York. He said that if Manhattan was viewed in isolation from New York's other four boroughs and the yardstick was the value of property sold, then Mr. Trump might be ''up there'' in the top ranks of developers, though he was still hesitant to label him the biggest.
Mr. Trump's real estate and casino holdings came under their first wrenching restructuring several years ago, when they were buried under $3.2 billion of debt, about $1 billion of which the developer had personally guaranteed. In the end, Mr. Trump narrowly averted personal bankruptcy proceedings by playing hardball with bank lenders too deeply enmeshed with him to cut him loose. But he was forced to sell several prized properties, like the Plaza Hotel and half of the land beneath the West Side yards.
''It's not bad to sell things. I owned them, and I sold them,'' Mr. Trump said. ''That's why the banks like me. They love my reputation.''
MR. TRUMP's three Atlantic City casinos -- the Taj Mahal, Trump Plaza and Trump Marina -- were ensnared in that earlier debt mess. He avoided losing them by taking them public and cutting his ownership stake to 25 percent from 100 percent. (He has since nearly doubled his stake.) Now he faces another diminution of his involvement in a casino business he built from scratch starting in the mid-1980's.
Atlantic City's gambling fortunes rebounded when Mr. Trump began his building binge there, and that city's modern face bore his stamp until the opening last summer of the Borgata Hotel Casino and Spa, a high-end enterprise.
The Borgata, a $1.1 billion joint venture of Boyd Gaming and MGM Mirage, has already lured customers away from the Trump casinos and other rivals by offering more popular nightclubs and headline entertainment. The Borgata's ''win'' -- a measure of the money gamblers lose in a casino -- was $266.8 million in just six months of operation last year, more than the $259.6 million win at the Trump Marina for the entire year. The Taj Mahal's 2003 win was $517 million, down about 4 percent from 2002, and Trump Plaza's was $318.2 million, a 7 percent drop from 2002.
The bitter weather of last winter also took a toll on the top line of Trump Hotels, but analysts say its ballooning interest payments are still the real problem. They also say that nearby properties have siphoned business from Trump Hotels by remodeling and expanding their facilities -- something that Mr. Trump's casinos are unable to do. While Trump Hotels has recently bolstered its management team, its options are limited. The company has been forced to cut costs and plow excess cash into hefty interest payments rather than the casinos.
Barbara Cappaert, an analyst at KDP Investment Advisors, said Trump Hotels had barely enough cash to support day-to-day maintenance and refurbishment and could not afford expansions like the new hotel tower the Taj Mahal needs to accommodate more guests.
Mr. Trump, meanwhile, stands to lose even more market share if neighboring states approve proposals on gambling. Pennsylvania officials are considering allowing slot machines at local racetracks, and New York legislators are reviewing several proposals.
MR. TRUMP'S negotiations with his bondholders are expected to intensify this week if investors receive a formal restructuring proposal. Bondholders seem to be ''more comfortable with the idea of Mr. Trump there for his brand name'' and Credit Suisse ''for a corporate governance check,'' said a Banc of America Securities analyst, Andrew M. Susser. Some bondholders and analysts go as far as suggesting that reducing Mr. Trump's role could lower the cost of borrowing for the company.
Even so, bondholders say that reaching an agreement could be difficult, because the deal is contingent on two sets of creditors accepting a discount on their bonds. The largest and most important group comprises major institutional investors who hold notes that have a face value of $1.3 billion and are backed by the Trump Plaza and Trump Taj Mahal properties. Those notes carry an 11.25 percent interest rate and mature in just two years. The other bonds have a face value of $490 million, come due in 2010 and carry interest rates of 12.625 percent to 18.625 percent.
Many bondholders and Wall Street analysts say that a bankruptcy filing is inevitable if the deal is to succeed. ''I think it is very likely that he will end up with a prepackaged or other bankruptcy,'' Mr. Susser said. ''It's hard to make the numbers work even if the bondholders take less than what they're owed.''
After peaking at $34 in 1996, Trump Hotels stock plunged to a low of $1.51 late last year. This year, largely on the back of the popularity of ''The Apprentice,'' the stock has climbed -- even though a bankruptcy filing could make the company's equity worthless. Since Mr. Trump started promoting the show, the stock price has risen 62 percent, to $3.40. ''If anything, the brand has gotten more valuable because of the show,'' Mr. Trump said. ''I think the name has helped the casinos in terms of the drawing of the crowds.''
While he said that ''Atlantic City has been a great place for me,'' he showed few signs of remorse over his diminishing role there. And he said he was optimistic that ''How to Get Rich'' might offer some valuable lessons for his bondholders.
''A bondholder could read 'How to Get Rich' and say: 'You know what? This is a good time to make a deal,''' he said.
Bondholders seem to be more pragmatic about what they can learn from Mr. Trump, including what value he brings to the casino enterprise to which they remain tethered. ''There is some value to having him there as the showman,'' one bondholder said. ''I am not sure if there's any benefit of having him C.E.O.''
MILLIONS know her as the ice queen of Thursday night: each week on ''The Apprentice,'' NBC's hit reality show, Carolyn Kepcher crosses her thin arms, as if to restrain herself from throwing up her hands, her blue gaze brittle as she scrutinizes the diminishing group of candidates competing for a $250,000 job with her boss, Donald Trump.
An executive vice president with a blond bouffant and exquisitely proper business attire, she is merciless and mirthless, especially in the boardroom scenes, as she eviscerates performances, helping to determine who is not worthy to toil for Himself.
''Carolyn is beautiful and she has a great look,'' Mr. Trump says of the businesswoman who oversees 250 Trump Organization employees and has worked for him almost as long as she's been married (a decade, to George, a project manager for another developer). ''But she is all business and not a lot of monkey business.''
Maybe so -- she did allow herself just three weeks' maternity leave after the births of Connor, 31/2, and Cassidy, 19 months -- but this tall, pretty woman, laughing and smiling as she dashes into her office at the Trump National Golf Club in Briarcliff Manor, N.Y., looks younger and more approachable than she does on TV. (She's 35.) Dressed with hip, vivid warmth in a black leather jacket, black pants, heels and a fire-engine-red turtleneck, with a softer, flattering haircut, Ms. Kepcher has a contagious energy as she whirls around, taking just one call. It's Himself.
''No, I can't see you staying in the villa; you'll get too many people gawking,'' she is saying, referring to the luxury homes that rim the 18-hole course. She beams at the receiver, telling him happy business news.
Afterward, she says: ''There's nothing like a good phone call like that in the morning to get you going. These town homes are selling like crazy.'' Ms. Kepcher is on a wild ride: the TV show is spawning a fresh clutch of demands, and she is also overseeing the next Trump golf club, in Bedminster, N.J. But fatigue couldn't be further from her face: ''I'm having more fun when I'm running at 100 miles an hour with my hair on fire. That's when I'm at my best.'' Small wonder that Ms. Kepcher, who enjoys rock-climbing with her family, was captain of the women's volleyball team at Mercy College.
''The Apprentice'' was shot over six weeks. (The final boardroom scene, with the last two competitors, will be shown live on April 15.) Ms. Kepcher spent a lot of time scrutinizing her assigned team as it bumbled through each new task, and those climactic boardroom scenes could last two hours. Meanwhile, she had to do her day job, dashing between her Trump golf courses.
(She thanks her husband, who fed and bathed the children, read to them at home in Ridgefield, Conn., and, in the morning, pointed out to Connor the red lipstick kiss on his cheek planted by Mommy before she tiptoed out hours earlier.)
So would it have killed her to smile a smidgen? ''Hey, it's a boardroom and someone will get fired,'' Ms. Kepcher replies. ''We're not there to say, 'You did such a good job, let me pat you on the back.' Is there a lot of negativity in there? Well, yeah!''
More about those scenes: ''The majority of the contestants didn't put up enough of a battle there,'' she says. If she had been in the running, ''I would have put up a stronger battle for myself; I am very determined and very stubborn.''
About the female candidates, their provocative, Ally McBeal-like outfits, their flirtatiousness: ''I was shocked by what they wore,'' she says. ''They lost sight of the fact that this was a job interview. If Donald Trump was a woman, would they be wearing those kind of clothes? These are eight very intelligent women with heads on their shoulders. Their sexuality only got them so far.'' (At the start of tonight's episode, just one woman, and four men, remain.)
MS. KEPCHER'S path to Trumpdom was relatively old-fashioned. A middle-class native of New Rochelle, N.Y., she had been at a management firm, assigned to move a bankrupt Westchester golf course into the black and attract a buyer. The task took her just a year.
Then, at an important meeting, Ms. Kepcher, the only woman in a roomful of men, Mr. Trump among them, gamely presented the numbers. ''Did I go into that meeting and compliment him?'' says Ms. Kepcher, comparing herself with the candidates on ''The Apprentice.'' Eyes roll. ''My goal was to get my smarts across and answer questions that came at me.''
Impressed with how she dominated the session, Mr. Trump promptly told Ms. Kepcher that after he bought the property, she would be working for him, running his new Briarcliff Manor golf club. She was 25.
As a boss herself, Ms. Kepcher has a reputation for being a great manager. Once, during a conference call, Trump corporate chieftains criticized a recent hire of hers. ''I take it that your silence means you agree?'' Mr. Trump inquired.
''I couldn't disagree more, Mr. Trump,'' replied Ms. Kepcher, whose instincts about who deserves to be a Trump employee proved, in time, to be exactly right.
In South Korea, regionalism has traditionally been the deciding factor in elections. People here in the southeast, used to sending military and civilian rulers to Seoul, backed the Grand National Party or other conservative parties. Voters in the southwest have supported the opposition parties.
But in the two-week campaign leading up to South Korea's parliamentary elections on April 15, age has replaced regionalism as the single most important factor. There are signs that younger voters here will vote based on the issues important to their generation rather than according to their region.
Jeong Hae Sun, 24, and her boyfriend, Park Byung Doo, 28, both natives of Taegu, were shopping at a small market here. Ms. Jeong said she did not like President Roh Moo Hyun or the Uri Party, which supports him. ''I'll support the Grand National Party,'' she said.
But Mr. Park, carrying tofu inside a plastic bag, said he would support the Uri Party because it was ''progressive and reform-minded.''
At a nearby shoe store, its owner, Lee Beon Yong, 42, said hesitantly that he, too, would support the local candidate for the Uri Party. ''I want this blasted regionalism to disappear,'' he said. ''I'll vote for the best candidate.''
Behind the histrionics of Korean politics -- punctuated recently by members of the National Assembly locked in wrestling holds as lawmakers moved to impeach President Roh Moo Hyun -- a generational and ideological divide has emerged more clearly than ever. The results of the elections on Thursday will indicate what direction South Korea will take on issues like North Korea and South Korea's security alliance with the United States.
The conservative Grand National Party, which had a majority in the National Assembly and is popular among older voters, has been struggling since leading the unpopular impeachment. The liberal Uri Party, which draws support from younger voters, looked set to capture a majority, though a gaffe from its chairman appears to have hurt it. Polls are barred during the campaign period for the assembly's 299 seats.
The fate of Mr. Roh, elected a little over a year ago for a five-year term, lies with the Constitutional Court. But the ballot is also seen as a referendum on his presidency and may influence the outcome of the impeachment process.
The campaign's defining moment may have occurred when it was disclosed that Chung Dong Young, the chairman of the Uri Party, said Koreans in their 60's and 70's ''don't need to vote'' and should ''just stay at home and rest.'' Younger Koreans should decide the country's future, he said.
He has been apologizing ever since, and rivals have pounced on the blunder. A protest over the comment led gray-haired men in checkered jackets and blue suits to tussle in a park in Seoul, grabbing one another's arms and legs. ''Never too old to fight,'' wrote The JoongAng Daily.
A Grand National candidate in Taegu, Joo Seong Young, 46, delivered a speech on Saturday next to a senior citizens' center. Koreans in their 60's and 70's had built South Korea with their sweat, he said.
''He's telling these people not to vote,'' Mr. Joo said of the Uri chairman. ''How can he even think such thoughts, much less blurt them out?''
In Seoul's Shinchon neighborhood, the site of several colleges, the chairman, Mr. Chung, apologized again for his remark, and tried to portray the election as a fight not against old people, but old politics.
''This election on April 15 will be a pivotal moment to see whether the people win or lose,'' Mr. Chung said.
[But on Monday, without specifically mentioning his gaffe, Mr. Chung quit as chief of the election campaign and dropped out of the race for his seat in National Assembly, Reuters reported. He said he was putting the party chairmanship ''on the line,'' pending the outcome of the election.]
When Mr. Roh was elected president, the political establishment was stunned. A human rights lawyer, with little political experience and no college degree, he was the ultimate outsider. But his message resonated with the wired generation, which was disillusioned with the corrupt political establishment and its cozy ties with big business, and which cast a skeptical look at the United States while being receptive to closer ties with North Korea.
To some older Koreans, though, who grew up fiercely anti-Communist and pro-American, the changes have been hard to swallow.
Mr. Roh's supporters say he has created a more democratic South Korea. He has begun decentralizing power to local governments and giving real autonomy to the country's prosecutors, tax and security agents. He has given rein to prosecutors to investigate corruption, leading to the arrest of even some of his own close aides. He has given access to all news organizations, while undermining the press club structure that guaranteed snug ties between the government and the big media.
Kim Byong Joon, chairman of the presidential committee on government innovation and decentralization, said Mr. Roh's opponents were afraid of moving South Korea, which first began democratizing in 1987, from a ''Confucian, authoritarian'' order to an open society.
The opposition moved to impeach Mr. Roh, Mr. Kim said, because it saw that he was ''serious about reform.''
''President Roh gave prosecutors full discretion so that they were even able to investigate wrongdoing by his closest aides,'' Mr. Kim said.
Conservatives, however, accuse Mr. Roh of creating chaos. They say he has exploited the generational fissures, as well as a widening class divide, to win support at the expense of social unity. His administration has been overly accommodating of North Korea, while capitalizing on anti-American sentiments, they say.
''If the Uri Party gains a majority and President Roh remains in power, we will see more pro-North Korea and anti-U.S. tendencies,'' said Cho Gab Je, editor in chief of the conservative Monthly Chosun magazine. ''In general, South Korean society will move from the sphere of the United States to the sphere of China.''
With this sharpening ideological rift, the National Assembly, controlled by conservatives, voted to impeach Mr. Roh. The president, barred from campaigning in legislative elections, was impeached after that he would help the Uri Party gain seats. Mr. Roh is not a member of the Uri Party but enjoys its backing.
The impeachment angered Mr. Roh's supporters as well as South Korea's political mainstream.
''I definitely call it a coup d'état,'' said Kang Chan Ki, 40, a construction worker and an official of an organization called Rohsamo, which means ''group that loves Roh.''

 Re "War of the Roses": I always called 28th Street between Sixth and Seventh Avenues "the poor man's botanic garden,'' a great block to walk with a date.

 Daredevil Pedestrians on Queens Boulevard 
 To the Editor: 
 Re "The Mayor Cries Safety, Residents Cry Brushoff'' (April 11): About a week ago, I had occasion to drive on the stretch of Queens Boulevard referred to in your article. 
 Having read about this "boulevard of death,'' what stuck me then was that at every intersection, although I had a green light, streams of pedestrians crossed the street in front of my moving car as I drove as if the car were invisible. I felt as if I were dodging moving targets. 
 Now, as I read yet another story about resident indignation about lack of safety on Queens Boulevard, it occurs to me that what may really be needed here is some long overdue pedestrian education.

 Hailing a Maven of Yiddish 
 To the Editor: 
 I enjoyed "After 100 Years, Still Dreaming of Corned Beef and Yiddish'' (April 4), about the editor of Yiddishe Kultur, Itche Goldberg. As an acolyte of the venerable Mr. Goldberg, I read the article with pride and pleasure or, as we say in Yiddish, mit groys fargenign. 
 Almost single-handedly, the 100-year-old Professor Goldberg, my former shule teacher and supervisor at Camp Kinderland, has kept Yiddish alive. Yiddishe Kultur, a vital literary journal, survives because of his heroic efforts and prodigious scholarship. 
 Thanks to him, my history lectures at Long Island University are laced with Yiddish expressions. Many of his students and colleagues will be honoring this bearer of secular culture next Sunday at Congregation Habonim, at 44 West 66th Street. 
 May Itche enjoy at least 20 more years of continued productivity salted with an ample supply of corned beef sandwiches.

 On the Culinary Trail Around the Boroughs 
 To the Editor: 
 Your April 4 article on tourism in the boroughs outside Manhattan, "Wonderful Towns,'' does not mention that there have been quite a few tours to the neighborhoods for years. The Municipal Art Society, the New School Culinary Arts Program - and my own outfit, NoshWalks - offer tours to dozens of borough neighborhoods all year long. 
 During the 1980's, I led daylong "gourmet'' bicycle tours in the Bronx, Queens, Brooklyn and Staten Island.

In June, Premiere Radio Networks will begin syndicating 60- to 90-second radio commentaries by someone it hopes will become the next Paul Harvey.
His name? Donald J. Trump.
Mr. Trump is set to speak mostly about business-related matters in the daily commentary, to be called ''Trumped!'' But Premiere, in announcing its affiliation with him yesterday, said it suspected that Mr. Trump, the famous real estate developer and star of reality television, would also have plenty to say about current events.
And once Mr. Trump's hit television program, ''The Apprentice,'' returns for its second season next fall, he will comment each Friday on the developments in that week's episode, said Sean Compton, vice president for programming at Clear Channel Radio; Premiere is a Clear Channel subsidiary.
When he pitched his proposal for a daily commentary to Mr. Trump, Mr. Compton said he invoked the name of Mr. Harvey, whose commentaries (and idiosyncratic delivery) have been a fixture on radio for more than a half-century.
Mr. Compton quoted Mr. Trump as responding: ''I always loved what he does.''
Mr. Compton said that Mr. Trump, who will record his broadcasts primarily in his office on Fifth Avenue in Manhattan, was traveling yesterday and not available for comment.
Trump Hotels and Casino Resorts, the centerpiece of Donald J. Trump's struggling casino empire, reported a quarterly loss of nearly $49 million yesterday, further undermining the company's tenuous financial position and complicating its ability to meet hefty debt payments due at the end of this month and in the fall.
Trump Hotels has about $1.8 billion in debt that has drained the company of the cash it needs to maintain its properties and compete effectively in the Atlantic City gambling market. Over the last few months, the company and its bondholders have been considering options to deal with the debt burden, including a prepackaged bankruptcy or a recapitalization that would cede control of the company to a major investment bank.
Either option would result in a sharply decreased role at Trump Hotels for Mr. Trump, the chief executive, who has been accused by analysts and bondholders of ineffective management and slipshod financial practices.
Trump Hotels said it lost $48.8 million, or $1.63 a share, in the quarter, compared with a loss of $24 million, or $1.09 a share, in the period a year earlier. Trump Hotels has never been profitable since it became a public company in 1995. The company said yesterday's losses included a provision of $19.1 million related to the payment of state taxes in Indiana. The company's quarterly revenue was $276.2 million, down from $278.8 million.
Trump Hotels released its earnings after the stock market closed yesterday, but investors seem to have anticipated the company's financial hemorrhaging. In heavy trading on the New York Stock Exchange, shares of Trump Hotels plunged 34 cents, or about 16 percent, to $1.80.
The possibility of a bankruptcy filing and a sell-off of Trump Hotels' shares has caused the company's overall stock market value to be sliced nearly in half over the last month, dropping to about $54 million at the close of trading yesterday from about $102 million. Mr. Trump's 49 percent stake in the company has also been devalued, dropping to $26.5 million from about $50 million a month ago.
If shares of Trump Hotels continue their steep drop, the Big Board could delist them, though they have not yet declined far enough to meet the exchange's complex delisting criteria.
Nonetheless, Mr. Trump, in a statement he released along with yesterday's earnings, tried to put a bright spin on the results, citing the climate, the competition and television as factors affecting his business.
''The Atlantic City market has become increasingly more competitive,'' he noted. ''However, the more favorable weather conditions this year helped offset the effects of this increased competition. The Trump brand is as strong as it's ever been. The success of 'The Apprentice' has generated significant exposure for our company's largest asset, the Trump Taj Mahal.''
Mr. Trump and New Jersey gambling regulators have said that they are confident that Trump Hotels will be able to make two interest payments of about $73.1 million each that come due today and Nov. 1, though the company already indicated in public filings this year that it would need to take advantage of a 30-day grace period to make the May payment on time. Mr. Trump's representatives have been negotiating with bondholders to avert a bankruptcy filing.
Last month, Trump Hotels announced that Credit Suisse First Boston was willing to inject $400 million in cash into the company in exchange for a controlling stake. Although bondholders would have to accept a steep discount on their investment, some say they might accept the deal because it would mean a bank, and not Mr. Trump, would oversee the company's operations.
If a deal is reached, it would reduce a large part of the $1.8 billion debt load and leave Mr. Trump with only a 20 percent stake in a new company called Trump International. Mr. Trump would be ousted as chief executive but would remain chairman of a five-member board.
Still, analysts say that reaching an agreement before the end of the month may be difficult. And with Trump Hotels bleeding cash, the clock is ticking even more loudly.
''I'd be pretty impressed if they could get it done that fast,'' said Andrew M. Susser, an analyst at Banc of America Securities. ''There are a lot of moving pieces that have to come together to get bondholders to agree on these things.''
Bondholder representatives have met with Trump Hotels' executives several times since negotiations began in earnest in early April, when the company submitted its initial restructuring proposal. Late last week, the bondholders' advisers recommended that some debtholders seriously consider accepting the offer, people involved in the discussions said. Bondholders are also considering a restructuring proposal of their own.
In an interview yesterday, Scott C. Butera, executive vice president of Trump Hotels, described the negotiations as ''constructive.''
Five years of dry weather have robbed the Colorado River of much of its mountain snowmelt, but the drought is hardly noticeable from a raft tossing downstream between the mile-high walls here.
That is because this part of the river is mechanized, flowing not to the rhythms of snowfall and the seasons but to a carefully calibrated, government-decreed schedule.
Below Lake Powell, the 186-mile-long cistern formed by the Glen Canyon Dam, the Colorado is a succession of human-induced flushes that generate electricity and entertain white-water boaters on its way to watering lawns and filling bathtubs in Phoenix, Las Vegas and Los Angeles.
Even as the river here spills over billion-year-old boulders in a wondrous place that leaves even hardened geologists weak-kneed, every drop is the subject of a state, federal or international agreement and is assigned a prospective owner.
''It is an artifact of living in the desert,'' said Bennett W. Raley, the assistant secretary of the interior for water and science, whose department oversees a system of dams and reservoirs that divvy up the river among seven Western states and Mexico.
To a visitor bobbing through the Grand Canyon, the artifice is easy to detect on weekends, when the demand drops for hydroelectric power from Glen Canyon Dam. The river drops too, leaving splash marks high along the granite and lava walls.
''It is like a swimming pool,'' said Ted Melis, a scientist with the United States Geological Survey who is conducting experiments on the river's sparkling clarity, due to the loss of natural sediment at the dam.
The subduing of the West's most magnificent desert river has created a lot of work for scientists like Dr. Melis, who are intent on keeping the Colorado more than just an engineering marvel. Dr. Melis spends his days looking for ways to muddy the waters so that native river fish like the endangered humpback chub are not such easy prey for the relative newcomers, like rainbow and brown trout.
On some nights, other scientists from the Grand Canyon Monitoring and Research Center, a federal agency where Dr. Melis works, are also busy on behalf of the old river.
They patrol the rapids in small motorboats with big spotlights. At quiet pools at the river's edge, they apply jolts of electricity to the water to temporarily stun the fish, which then float to the surface.
The chub and other endangered fish are measured, marked and returned to the river. The others are killed and their stomach contents studied before they are ground up and given to the Hualapai Indians for fertilizer. Tens of thousands of trout have been removed from the river this way.
''There is a suggestion that the humpback chub is increasing in these removal areas,'' said Jeff Lovich, chief of the monitoring and research center. ''The results are tantalizing.''
Dr. Lovich spoke to a group of scientists, government and water officials, journalists and an environmentalist who took a recent raft trip downriver through the heart of the Grand Canyon.
It took eight days to cover the 225 miles from Lees Ferry, Ariz., near the Utah border, to Diamond Creek in the Hualapai Indian reservation. The rafts were supplied by the Grand Canyon Monitoring and Research Center, which tracks the effects of the Glen Canyon Dam on the river.
The journey was premised on the drought but it touched upon many other things. Mr. Raley, the assistant interior secretary, told of successes the Bush administration has claimed along the river. The biggest, he said, was a deal last year with California about how to divide surplus Colorado water -- though it is unlikely that extra water will be much of an issue in the years to come.
Most talk was about the likelihood of water shortages, which the river has not seen since the Hoover Dam was built near Las Vegas in the 1930's. Many environmentalists already complain that the river is given too little water to support fish and other wildlife, let alone to flow the full 1,400 miles to the delta, which is a fraction of its size a century ago.
Mr. Raley insists that Nevada, Arizona and California need to speed up plans for what to do if the drought persists.
One hot afternoon, he lined up three water officials in a narrow slice of shade and prodded them as they worried aloud about the prospect of tightening water supplies.
''We want to make this work because we are terrified of the consequences across the spectrum if it is not working,'' Mr. Raley said.
Some consequences of the drought can be observed a short distance upstream at Lake Powell, a reservoir named for John Wesley Powell, the geologist who explored the Grand Canyon in the 1860's and 70's.
The Colorado was wildly unpredictable back then, sometimes running out of steam before getting much beyond the canyons here and sometimes barreling through to the Gulf of California. Now Lake Powell is more than half empty and still dropping. The same is happening below the Grand Canyon at Lake Mead.
In the lore of the West, there is no more mythical river than the Colorado, and in some sense, this drought may be just one more cliffhanger for the river to tell.
''We have an unknown distance yet to run, an unknown river to explore,'' Powell wrote on Aug. 13, 1869, as he entered the Grand Canyon. ''What falls there are, we know not; what rocks beset the channel, we know not; what walls rise above the river, we know not. Ah, well! We may conjecture many things.''
''Reality,'' that odd creature that is increasingly poking its heavy-breathing nose onto TV screens, is giving us shows like ''The Apprentice,'' in which every eager applicant seems to have one dream and one dream only: to work (Be still, you quivering cufflinks!) for Donald J. Trump.
We interrupt this mania for a word from Clark Consulting, a compensation and benefits firm, which was mischievous enough to ask 357 executives at public companies just how much Mr. Trump would have to pay them to work for him. (Why the poll? Because, in the words of Tom Wamberg, Clark's chairman, ''no one should confuse the real world of business with what they see on reality TV.'')
Some, evidently, do revere him: a starry-eyed 8 percent would toil at the master's feet for nothing. Most said they would do it if the pay was good enough -- but not, many said, for a mere $250,000 a year, which is what the winner of ''The Apprentice'' gets. Fully a third said there was not enough cash in all those glittering towers to induce them ever to work for The Donald. Really.

Veteran gamblers know better than to bet against the house. But what if the house is owned by Donald J. Trump, whose cash-starved casino holdings are struggling to stay afloat?
Mr. Trump is essentially placing a high-stakes bet that his casinos will generate enough cash over the next few weeks to make a $73.1 million debt payment that is due at the end of the month. It will be a tight squeeze, even for someone with the feline financial dexterity of Mr. Trump. Bankruptcy looms.
Buried at the bottom of the unaudited first-quarter earnings report that Trump Hotels and Casino Resorts released last Friday was a sobering figure: $91.4 million, the amount of cash that two of Mr. Trump's Atlantic City casinos can tap to help meet the debt payment.
Though that cash trove exceeds the debt payment, it is not unencumbered. New Jersey gambling regulators require casinos to keep a reserve known as ''cage cash'' to cover unexpected payouts to winning bettors and to provide a cushion for tax payments and payroll. The cage cash reserve at the Trump Taj Mahal and Trump Plaza, the casinos responsible for this month's debt payment, is about $50 million -- meaning that only $41.4 million of the casinos' cash can be applied to the $73.1 million tab.
The rest of the debt will have to be paid out of the two casinos' fresh cash flow, which averaged about $12 million a month in the first quarter. Before the Borgata casino opened in Atlantic City last year and began eating into the market share of Trump Hotels and Casinos, the two casinos had free cash flow of about $18 million a month from April through June.
That suggests that if the Trump casinos somehow manage to ante up all their available cash, fork over the entirety of April and May's cash flow, and dodge other unforeseen expenses for the rest of the month -- they will have $65 million to $77 million on hand in a few weeks to pay a $73.1 million obligation. It is enough to make even reckless gamblers queasy.
Trump Hotels reported its earnings on Friday evening, an hour after the stock market closed and when most of Wall Street was already on its way home for the weekend. While the company's filing crept in like the fog on little cat feet, its finances are hardly elusive. Mr. Trump's company reported a first-quarter loss of nearly $49 million, about twice its loss a year earlier. Trump Hotels has sputtered along so weakly that it has been unable to spend money on upgrading to fend off the Borgata's advance (though, as the company's proxy filing on Friday showed, Mr. Trump still managed to receive a $1.5 million salary last year).
Of course, one way out of this mess is to find a friendly outsider with deep pockets. Mr. Trump is contemplating just that. He says he is willing to cede control of the company and his job as chief executive to secure a $400 million cash infusion from an investment bank, an arrangement that would be subject to the approval of the company's wary and battered bondholders.
A spokeswoman for the New Jersey Division of Gaming Enforcement, which regulates the state's casinos, monitors their finances and sets cage-cash guidelines, said that the agency believed that Trump Hotels was ''financially stable.''
Andrew M. Susser, an analyst at Banc of America Securities, said he expected the company to make the debt payment, but that it would need to draw upon April and May revenue to do so. ''Liquidity is certainly tight around coupon time,'' he said.
Mr. Trump has another Atlantic City casino, the Trump Marina, as well as small casino operations elsewhere that he might consider as possible lenders, but those casinos are already saddled with debt. Moreover, bond covenants and gambling regulations hinder the casinos' ability to share their funds.
Trump Hotels was supposed to make its debt payment on May 1, but it invoked a 30-day grace period. Barbara Cappaert, an analyst at KDP Investment Advisors, cautioned that the delay might reflect Mr. Trump's high-stakes negotiating tactics as much as the company's current financial hardships.
''By withholding it, it shows immediately that they need to restructure and it is a carrot for bondholders,'' she said. ''The implicit threat is that if they don't come to an agreement, the company would dissolve.''
Even if Trump Hotels has the cash to make its payment this month, it faces other coupon payments this fall and thereafter. Marvin Roffman, an analyst and longtime critic of Mr. Trump who predicted the Trump Taj Mahal's 1991 bankruptcy, is once again gloomy about Mr. Trump's prospects.
''He continues to see erosion in market share, his working capital is gone and the interest rate meter is starting to tick up,'' Mr. Roffman said. ''He is caught between a rock and a hard place. Now, he knows how his 'Apprentices' feel.''
Donald Trump and other major casino investors have quietly spent tens of millions of dollars to help Indian groups in Connecticut finance campaigns aimed at winning federal recognition as Indian tribes, according to testimony on Wednesday before a House committee.
The disclosure, made before the House Committee on Government Reform, gets to the heart of a major concern of critics who say private investors like Mr. Trump are bankrolling the efforts of would-be tribes in the hopes of grabbing a share of the Indian gambling industry. Federal tribal recognition allows Indian tribes to build casinos.
The most detailed testimony about the partnerships between private investors and would-be tribes came from Jeff Benedict, the founder of the Connecticut Alliance Against Casino Expansion, a nonprofit group made up of citizens, civic leaders and businesses.
Mr. Benedict testified that four major financiers, including Mr. Trump, had spent nearly $35 million in Connecticut alone helping several groups win tribal recognition from the federal Bureau of Indian Affairs.
Arguing that the situation in Connecticut is part of a larger pattern of abuse, he cited statistics showing that 291 groups nationwide are seeking federal recognition as tribes and that an estimated two-thirds of them have entered private deals with investors who want a cut of the $15 billion that is wagered annually in Indian-run casinos.
But Lyle Berman, whose company has spent about $4 million in helping the Nipmuc Nation in Connecticut petition for federal tribal recognition, offered no apologies for trying to become the tribe's partner in any future casino operation.
Moreover, he said that his company was performing a valuable service by helping the Nipmucs pay for the expensive legion of historians, lobbyists and lawyers they need to help them navigate the complex tribal-recognition process.
''There's no question we make money,'' Mr. Berman said in an interview. ''That's the American way. We see nothing wrong with that.''
Robert I. Reardon Jr., an lawyer for Mr. Trump, said, ''Everything that Mr. Trump's organization has done has been proper.''
Mr. Benedict was one of several witnesses who appeared before the committee to express, among other things, their concern over the proliferation of Indian-run casinos in Connecticut and across the nation. The hearing was convened at the urging of Representative Christopher Shays, a Republican from Connecticut who says he has long been troubled about the number of Indian-run casinos being built in his state.
Mr. Shays said that Mr. Trump and Tom Wilmot, a shopping mall developer who is a partner of the Golden Hill Paugussett, a would-be tribe based in Trumbull, Conn., had declined invitations to appear before the committee. He said that in light of the testimony that was given yesterday, the committee would press for the two men, along with other investors bankrolling would-be tribes in Connecticut, to appear.
''These are huge numbers,'' Mr. Shays said. ''We need to know what this money was spent on, and we are going to find out.''
Mr. Trump has been on both sides of the issue, fighting casinos closer to his Atlantic City operations, but also helping at least one Indian group in Connecticut, the Eastern Pequots, in their efforts to seek tribal recognition, which would allow them to build a casino there. Mr. Reardon noted, with some irony, that Mr. Trump got involved with the Eastern Pequots only after his criticism of the Indian gaming industry ''fell on deaf ears'' more than a decade ago.
Other speakers at the hearing included Richard Blumenthal, the attorney general of Connecticut who is leading an effort to overturn the federal government's recent recognition of three tribes in his state. Mr. Blumenthal expressed concern that private investors who are bankrolling would-be tribes are having an ''undue influence'' on the recognition process.
''I wish my office had one-tenth of the money these investors have spent to deal with these issues,'' he said after his testimony. ''We don't have those resources. We are vastly outgunned and outmanned.''
Mr. Blumenthal and others who appeared before the committee also called on the federal government to require private investors to disclose, among other things, the amount of money they spend on behalf of groups seeking tribal recognition.
Critics of the industry, in and outside government, have long complained that neither the would-be tribes nor the private investors who back them are required to disclose such information.
''If this committee does nothing more than implement rules of disclosure, it will have made a tremendous contribution,'' Mr. Blumenthal said in his testimony. In his testimony, Mr. Benedict said the major investors in Connecticut included Mr. Trump, who spent about $9.1 million helping the Eastern Pequots; Mr. Wilmot, the shopping mall developer who invested at least $10 million assisting the Golden Hill Paugussett, a group based in Trumbull; and Frederick A. DeLuca, the founder of the Subway restaurant chain, who also invested $10 million in the Golden Hill Paugussett.
But Mr. Reardon, the lawyer for Mr. Trump, said his client had been open about his work with the Indians. ''Neither Mr. Trump nor his organization has hidden the fact that they have supported this tribe.''
Mr. Benedict noted how drastically developers have changed their attitudes toward Indian gambling. ''Initially, casino moguls like Donald Trump attacked the rise of Indian casinos as a fraud,'' he said. ''But Trump and other casino entrepreneurs recognized the writing on the wall and adopted an 'If you can't beat them, join them' approach.''
You can't blame conductors and stage directors for feeling flummoxed when putting together a production of Leonard Bernstein's ''Candide.'' From its original 1956 incarnation through the multiple revisions of the score in which Bernstein took part, the composer and his collaborators were never sure they had the right mix of zany satire and touching sentiment for this tale, taken from Voltaire, of a strapping Westphalian youth who gullibly believes the philosophy of his tutor, Dr. Pangloss, that everything that happens must be for the best.
The director Lonny Price has assembled a hybrid version for the inventive semi-staged production that the New York Philharmonic presented at Avery Fisher Hall on Wednesday night, with two remaining performances tonight and tomorrow. It's a vibrant and often delightful show, except for the frequent, annoying and tasteless lapses into dumb topical jokes and sight gags that Mr. Price inserted into his adaptation of Hugh Wheeler's book. When, in just one of the disasters the exiled Candide encounters on his travels, he is condemned to death, the judge is portrayed as Donald Trump in a wavy wig, who is reading his own autobiography as he tells the young man, ''You're fired!''
The lapses were all the more unfortunate because much of the production was beguiling, starting with the fine conducting of Marin Alsop. Bernstein's score is itself a hybrid of wistfully lyrical songs, impish caricatures of opera and skillfully rendered pastiches of everything from Renaissance sacred music to slinky tangos. But many conductors, nervous about the stylistic mixings, can't help overselling the music by milking the tender melodies and pumping up the dances and patter songs.
Bernstein was an important mentor to Ms. Alsop, and she remains one of his most sensitive interpreters. From the start of the sprightly overture, she kept the pace lithe but reined in enough to allow the notes to speak. She had clearly worked with the splendid cast to find tempos that would allow them to enunciate the lyrics. She proved that the way to make the charm and richness of this score come through is to respect the music. The Philharmonic responded with stylish and beautifully relaxed playing.
The cast was topped by the irrepressible Kristin Chenoweth as Cunegonde, the bastard Candide's aristocratic half-cousin and the young woman he adores.
Ms. Chenoweth ably handled the stratospheric coloratura roulades of the show-stopping and vocally daunting ''Glitter and Be Gay,'' all the while acting the scene dynamically and shifting moods by the measure, one moment the teary-eyed innocent forced into sexual degradation, the next a savvy operator who finds compensation aplenty in her ruby rings and golden gowns.
She capped her triumphant final note with her arms thrust high, à la ''Evita,'' a witty nod to the presence in the cast of the formidable Patti LuPone. Ms. LuPone has the role of the Old Lady, who during several rambling narratives in myriad exotic accents relating her life of romance and tragedy never does explain why she has only one buttock.
Opera singers can often seem like classical-music stiffs when working alongside musical-theater pros. But the tenor Paul Groves more than held his own as an endearingly good-hearted and befuddled Candide. He gets the award for best diction of the night; he sang as if speaking to you.
Still, his performance was undermined by Mr. Price's inserted gags. When Candide is banished from Westphalia, just as Mr. Groves was singing Bernstein's poignant meditation ''It Must Be So'' with heartbreaking sweetness, Mr. Price had Candide pack a copy of the LP recording of ''West Side Story'' into his suitcase. Naturally, the audience burst into hearty laughter.
Thomas Allen, the distinguished British baritone, was an inspired choice for the multiple roles of Dr. Pangloss, the Narrator and Voltaire. Still, the elegant Sir Thomas seemed visibly uncomfortable now and then when he had to utter some lame topical joke, as when the Narrator explains that the Inquisition was unrivaled for its combination of the sacred and profane until the onset of the United States Senate. Huh?
Janine LaManna as Paquette, the maid, and Jeff Blumenkrantz as Maximillian, Cunegonde's vain brother, were the other two members of the youthful quartet who learn that there is no such thing as a best of all possible worlds. The choral finale, ''Make Our Garden Grow,'' which begins with Candide's vow to build a simple, decent life for himself and his beloved, was sung with resplendent sound by the Westminster Symphonic Choir. I wish they had repeated it, if only to banish memories of all the pointless jokes.
THE National Magazine Awards took place last week, honoring a coven of magazines built on long thoughts, gorgeous designs and an aspiration for the finer things in life, however unattainable.
Editors for publications like The New Yorker, W and Gourmet all marched up to the winner's podium. But also taking the victory mile was a far-less-known magazine, one that meets consumers where they actually live: Budget Living. The glossy homage to cheap chic was cited for general excellence in the category of magazines with circulations from 250,000 to 500,000. It beat the likes of Teen Vogue and Details.
While many magazines these days push $100 pens, $10,000 stoves and $100,000 cars, Budget Living has focused on a simple thought: You are indeed what you consume, and you are a moron if you pay too much for it.
That may not be much of a news bulletin at a time when Wal-Mart, Costco and Target have conquered the retail industry with low pricing. But the large media companies still seem stuck on William Blake's maxim that the road to excess leads to the palace of wisdom, and they miss a more common point: Everyone, including, and perhaps especially, the wealthy, loves a good deal. Why else would the parking lot of Costco be clogged with Mercedeses and its aisles dotted with shoppers in furs?
Budget Living's message, ''Spend Smart, Live Rich,'' counterintuits the conventional wisdom that people buy magazines to see how the other half lives. The six-times-a-year magazine is more concerned with sofas that start at $250 than with fueling unattainable consumptive dreams.
When Donald E. Welch started Budget Living, he was told by many big publishers that a magazine with the word ''budget'' in the title would never succeed in a country hooked on glamour and luxury. He disagreed. ''Part of being tasteful is not being a sucker in what you buy,'' he said.
His magazine, of course, was started on a shoestring and runs frugally. Budget Living suggests that to a new generation of adult consumers, the only thing embarrassing in searching for a good deal is not finding one.
Most of the magazine racks will continue to be reserved for lifestyle voyeurism, with fanciful goods arrayed over impossibly beautiful people. But the success of Budget Living suggests that readers will want to read those magazines while sitting in a recliner that looks like a million bucks and costs a fraction of retail.
Stocks gained yesterday on optimism that a growing economy will limit the effects of rising interest rates, recovering from a drop the day before that sent benchmark indexes to their lows for 2004.
The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index climbed 8.33 points yesterday, or 0.8 percent, to 1,095.45. The Nasdaq index rose 35.28 points, or 1.9 percent, to 1,931.35. The Dow Jones industrial average rose for the first time in five days, adding 29.45 points, or 0.3 percent, to 10,019.47. The gain was limited by a drop in shares of the Altria Group.
Since reaching a 23-month high on Feb. 11, the S.&P. 500 has shed 5.4 percent, while the Dow has lost 6.7 percent from its 31-month high the same day. The Nasdaq has retreated 10 percent since its two-and-a-half-year high in January.
Almost four stocks rose yesterday for every one that fell on the New York Stock Exchange, making it the broadest advance in three months. Some 1.5 billion shares changed hands on the Big Board, 1.2 percent more than this year's daily average.
On Monday, seven stocks closed at new 52-week highs on the New York Stock Exchange, the lowest in almost eight years. There were 635 new lows, the most in almost two years.
''Those are figures you see at the end of a sell-off,'' said Gil Knight, a fund manager at Gartmore Global Investments, which oversees $77 billion, and is based in West Conshohocken, Pa. ''We're due for some kind of snap-back.''
Intel, the world's largest semiconductor maker, added $1.22, to $27.77. The company increased inventories to the highest levels since 2001 in a bet that spending on electronics will rise. Worldwide chip sales surged 32 percent in March from a year earlier, the Semiconductor Industry Association said last week.
Among the S.&P. 500's 10 industry groups, the index of technology companies contributed more than a third of the benchmark's advance. Texas Instruments, whose chips power half the cellphones sold last year, rose 71 cents to $26.34. Yahoo, the Internet company, jumped $2.20, to $53.53.
Shares of oil and gas companies jumped after crude oil futures closed above $40 a barrel, the highest price in almost 14 years. An index of energy shares in the S.&P. 500 rose 1.6 percent, the second-biggest gain among the benchmark's 10 industry groups.
The Marathon Oil Corporation climbed $1.05, to $33.70. The Amerada Hess Corporation advanced $2.06, to $71.21. Kinder Morgan Inc., an operator of natural-gas and fuel pipelines, added $1.74, to $58.65. The Halliburton Company, the world's largest oilfield-services company, gained 96 cents, to $28.90 after saying it may receive $1.6 billion from insurers to settle disputes over asbestos claims.
Symbol Technologies, the world's largest seller of bar-code scanners, soared $1.83, or 15 percent, to $14.08, for the biggest gain in the S.&P. 500. Symbol reported first-quarter revenue of $419.7 million, exceeding the estimate of $408.8 million from a Thomson survey.
Altria, the parent of the cigarette maker Philip Morris, lost $1.49, to $53.40. The 2.7 percent drop was the biggest in the Dow average. The company said full-year profit would be $4.50 to $4.60 a share because of costs for a preliminary settlement with the European Commission over cigarette-smuggling charges. Three weeks ago, Altria forecast earnings of $4.57 to $4.67 a share, excluding potential costs for the agreement.
Electronic Data Systems, the world's second-largest seller of computer services, sank $1.03, or 5.9 percent, to $16.48, for the steepest drop in the S.&P. 500. The company said it might slash its dividend by 67 percent, the first cut ever, to help raise more than $1 billion and keep its investment-grade credit rating. The company may also sell stock to raise money.
United States Treasury notes rose after the government's sale of $24 billion of debt showed that demand remained high from a group that includes foreign central banks, raising optimism for the two other auctions scheduled for this week. By late in the day, the benchmark 10-year note rose 10/32 to 94 6/32. The yield, which moves in the opposite direction of the price, fell to 4.75 percent, from 4.80 percent on Monday.

What's a name worth? Donald J. Trump, who on Friday announced that he would lend his name to a luxury apartment building in Westchester that is almost half built, will not say.
Interviewed by telephone as he putted toward the ninth hole in a golf game, Mr. Trump declined to disclose any aspect of his financial interest in the deal beyond insisting that renaming the 35-story building Trump Tower at City Center was sure to increase the value.
''The name Trump has got more recognition than any other name in the business,'' Mr. Trump said. ''People know it means quality and they recognize that with higher prices.''
A real estate developer better known recently for firing hapless contestants on the television show 'The Apprentice,' Mr. Trump said his company would be involved in development, sale and management when the building is complete.
''I will not be having anyone from 'The Apprentice' running this project,'' Mr. Trump said. ''But I do hope this building will be as successful as the show.''
Sixteen stories of the building, which is expected to open in the summer of 2005, have already been completed. It is part of the $325 million City Center complex here that is being built by Louis R. Cappelli, a Westchester developer. In addition to the 212 luxury condominiums of the newly renamed Trump Tower, the complex includes retailers like Barnes & Noble and the New York Sports Club.
Like many of its predecessors, the Bush White House has used the machinery of government to promote the re-election of the president by awarding federal grants to strategically important states. But in a twist this election season, many administration officials are taking credit for spreading largess through programs that President Bush tried to eliminate or to cut sharply.
For example, Justice Department officials recently announced that they were awarding $47 million to scores of local law enforcement agencies for the hiring of police officers. Mr. Bush had just proposed cutting the budget for the program, known as Community Oriented Policing Services, by 87 percent, to $97 million next year, from $756 million.
The administration has been particularly energetic in publicizing health programs, even ones that had been scheduled for cuts or elimination.
Tommy G. Thompson, the secretary of health and human services, announced recently that the administration was awarding $11.7 million in grants to help 30 states plan and provide coverage for people without health insurance. Mr. Bush had proposed ending the program in each of the last three years.
The administration also announced recently that it was providing $11.6 million to the states so they could buy defibrillators to save the lives of heart attack victims. But Mr. Bush had proposed cutting the budget for such devices by 82 percent, to $2 million from $10.9 million.
Whether they involve programs Mr. Bush supported or not, the grant announcements illustrate how the administration blends politics and policy, blurring the distinction between official business and campaign-related activities.
In recent weeks, administration officials have fanned out around the country. Within a 48-hour period this month, Treasury Secretary John W. Snow was in Wisconsin and Illinois, doling out federal aid to poor neighborhoods. Anthony J. Principi, the secretary of veterans affairs, was in Las Vegas to announce plans for a new veterans hospital. Energy Secretary Spencer Abraham was in South Carolina to announce a new national research laboratory. And a top transportation official was in Portland, Me., awarding a $13 million grant to the city's airport.
In some cases, overtly political appearances are piggybacked onto such trips. Earlier this month, Mr. Principi was in Florida announcing plans for another veterans hospital, in Orlando, with a side trip to Tampa to kick off a national coalition of veterans supporting the re-election of Mr. Bush.
A few days earlier, while traveling to Marco Island, Fla., on official business, Commerce Secretary Donald L. Evans stopped in Daytona Beach to attend a large prayer meeting, where he praised Mr. Bush as ''a leader you can trust 100 percent of the time.''
The combination of official business and politics is neither illegal nor unusual in an election year, though Bush administration officials were reluctant to provide details. In fact, the Bush administration is using techniques refined by President Bill Clinton. The difference is that in the Clinton years the White House was often trying to add and expand domestic programs, not cut them.
The government has byzantine rules for documenting mixed official and political travel. The goal is to ensure that the campaign or some other political group pays for parts of a trip that are purely political.
But as the General Accounting Office, an investigative arm of Congress, has said, ''it is often impossible to neatly categorize travel as either purely business or purely political.''
Ron Bonjean, a spokesman for Mr. Evans, said the Republican National Committee paid for the commerce secretary's stop in Daytona Beach on May 6. A local newspaper, The News-Journal, said the prayer meeting there ''evolved into a rousing Republican political rally.''
The contrast between politics and policy is particularly striking when the administration takes credit for spending money appropriated by Congress against the president's wishes.
In April, Secretary Thompson announced that the administration was awarding $3.1 million in grants to improve health care in rural areas of Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Iowa, New Mexico and New York. He did not mention that the administration was trying to cut the same rural health program by 72 percent, to $11.1 million next year, from $39.6 million.
Mr. Thompson likewise recently boasted that the administration was awarding $16 million to 11 universities to train blacks and Hispanic Americans as doctors, dentists and pharmacists. But at the same time, the administration was urging Congress to abolish the program, on the ground that ''private and corporate entities'' could pay for training.
Alberto R. Gonzales, the White House counsel, has sent a memorandum to Cabinet officers saying they must carefully allocate travel costs between the government and the campaign.
''There is considerable room for discretion in determining whether an event giving rise to an expense is political or official,'' Mr. Gonzales wrote. Ultimately, he said, the decision depends on the facts of each case.
Interior Department lawyers said that Secretary Gale A. Norton had made eight entirely political trips and 17 trips combining official business with political activity, for which the government was reimbursed. The political sponsor typically pays a share of the costs, based on the amount of time spent on political activity, said Timothy S. Elliott, a lawyer at the department.
Last month, on a trip to Alaska, Ms. Norton attended two fund-raisers, in Juneau and Anchorage. ''It's always beneficial to have members of the cabinet at these events,'' said Randy Ruedrich, chairman of the Republican Party of Alaska.
A trip to Minneapolis by Education Secretary Rod Paige shows a similar mix. John M. Gibbons, a spokesman for the secretary, said Mr. Paige went to a Republican fund-raiser there on Feb. 17, then visited schools the next day.
On March 13, Mr. Paige made a political trip to Orlando for a Republican dinner. He was back in Florida for a Bush-Cheney fund-raiser in Fort Lauderdale on March 26 and for the annual conference of the National School Boards Association, in Orlando, on March 28-29.
Likewise, Anthony T. Jewell, a spokesman for Mr. Thompson, said the health secretary attended a Republican fund-raiser on April 22 while visiting Detroit to promote organ donation.
The precedents for such activity run deep. Phillip M. Caplan, who was a special assistant to President Clinton, said the Clinton White House had a weekly conference call with chiefs of staff at Cabinet departments.
''We would tell officials, for example, that the president will be in Ohio on the 27th of this month, so you should scour the agency, and if you have something coming up in Ohio, let us know,'' Mr. Caplan recalled. ''The announcement of grants was timed to coincide with the president's visit. The goal was to maximize the credit and visibility for the president.''
Scott M. Stanzel, a spokesman for the Bush campaign, said: ''The law sets forth clear guidelines as to how costs should be allocated. We adhere to the guidelines. We pay travel and other costs for government officials participating in political events.''
Transportation Secretary Norman Y. Mineta, a Democrat, says he does not participate in partisan political events. But Robert L. Johnson, a spokesman for the department, said that senior officials had attended Republican fund-raisers while traveling on official business.
It could have been a scene straight out of the hit reality show ''The Apprentice.''
Ricardo R. Bellino, a young Brazilian entrepreneur who made his name as a manager in the modeling business, walked into Donald Trump's office in Manhattan and was met with the following greeting: ''Look, you have three minutes to sell me your idea.''
In the end, Mr. Bellino got 30 minutes to pitch his plan for a golf club and resort carrying the Trump name on the outskirts of São Paulo, South America's financial capital. Mr. Trump, never one to shy away from a potential business opportunity, bought the idea on the spot.
''I think that my style, which is a bit daring and irreverent like his, helped win him over,'' Mr. Bellino, 38, said of the meeting with Mr. Trump in January 2003 that sealed their partnership. ''We really hit it off, and that allowed us to get down to business pretty quickly.''
True to the Trump mold, the $40 million project is aimed at Brazil's wealthy. To be built in the hills of Itatiba, a quiet rural community about 55 miles outside São Paulo, Mr. Trump's first foray into Latin America will include an 18-hole golf course, a luxury hotel and spa, and eventually up to 500 memberships, 350 of which come with plots of land for personal mansions.
The 150 founding members, who will be handpicked by Mr. Bellino and the rest of the board at his real estate company, Trump Realty Brazil, will also get a fully furnished private cottage on the course. The initiation fee for members is expected to surpass that of the Trump International Golf Club in West Palm Beach, Fla., costing $350,000 to $500,000 each.
The project, dubbed Villa Trump, will be financed separately from the real estate and gambling empire Trump Hotels and Casino Resorts, which is under severe financial strain. Most of the financing will come from two of Brazil's wealthiest families -- the Meyerfreunds, who made a fortune in the chocolate business, and the Depieris, founders of the Brazilian pharmaceutical giant Aché Laboratórios.
Mr. Trump is not the only big name Mr. Bellino managed to bring on board. He also tapped the golfing great Jack Nicklaus to design the course, which is expected to cost $10 million to build, including a $2 million fee for Mr. Nicklaus.
And at Mr. Trump's request, honorary celebrity members will include former President Bill Clinton and Hollywood stars like Michael Douglas, John Travolta and Jack Nicholson.
''It's big enough, it's grand enough, and the way it's being built certainly will meet the Trump name,'' said George Ross, executive vice president and senior council at the Trump Organization in New York. ''We are not interested in anything that is mediocre. It has to be the best, and that's what this is going to be.''
In a country like Brazil, where more than a third of the population lives on less than $2 a day, a playground for the very rich may seem risky. After all, only 20,000 people out of a population of 175 million play golf here -- a far cry from the more than 20 million Americans who tee up every now and then in the United States.
But Brazil is a land of stark contrasts, and the country's wealthy are among the world's biggest, most lavish spenders. Wealthy Brazilians make no bones about flying to New York or Paris for a weekend of shopping, often followed by paparazzi from back home. One socialite famously cemented her reputation in Rio de Janeiro's high society by spending thousands of dollars on a birthday party -- for her dog.
''The amount of money you have, especially in the region around São Paulo, is absolutely mind-boggling,'' said John Casablancas, the modeling mogul who introduced Mr. Bellino to Mr. Trump. ''You can be so elitist and so selective that you can focus on the upper crust of the upper crust.''
Mr. Casablancas, who sits on the board at Trump Realty Brazil and calls himself a ''lifestyle consultant of sorts'' for the resort's planning committee, predicts that Villa Trump will be such a success that it will end up having to turn people away.
''I'm totally convinced that the No.1 challenge is going to be to say no to the 3,000 or 4,000 people who can afford it,'' he said, ''but who wouldn't make the place be as special as it should be.''
Construction of the resort is expected to begin in about three months, once the government grants the necessary environmental permits. If all goes as planned, developers hope Villa Trump can open in the second half of 2006.
In the meantime, Mr. Bellino, who does not play golf, is doing all he can to promote the Trump name in Brazil. His group recently bought the rights to the Brazilian Open professional golf tournament for the next 30 years, naming it the Trump Open.
Now Mr. Bellino is toying with idea of bringing ''The Apprentice'' to South America, first to show the original version and eventually to produce a local series with Brazilian candidates.
''We're already in talks with the producers to bring the show to Brazil,'' he said. ''But we've got other plans too. Obviously, it would be nice to have our own skyscraper on Paulista Avenue -- a Trump Tower on the Brazilian equivalent to New York's Fifth Avenue.''
Attorney General Eliot Spitzer said Thursday that he would return $21,000 in campaign contributions from Donald J. Trump after being criticized for accepting money from him while he had business pending before Mr. Spitzer's office.
Mr. Trump made his donations in 2002 and 2003, while Mr. Spitzer's office was deciding a landlord-tenant dispute involving a condominium at the Trump World Tower, one of his Manhattan properties. Last June, Mr. Trump won the case.
Mr. Spitzer has made his mark by investigating Wall Street, and his reputation from those inquiries has led to speculation that he might run for governor in 2006.
His office was quick to reject as baseless any suggestion that the campaign contributions might have influenced his deciding the landlord-tenant dispute in favor of Mr. Trump.
Darren Dopp, an aide to Mr. Spitzer, said that the attorney general had not known at the time that Mr. Trump had business pending before his office. Though the campaign contributions are legal, Mr. Dopp said the mere appearance of impropriety was enough to warrant the return of the money.
''Unlike many other elected officials, Mr. Spitzer does not accept campaign contributions from individuals or organizations that have pending business with his office,'' Mr. Dopp said.
Blair Horner, the legislative director for the New York Public Interest Group, applauded Mr. Spitzer's decision to return the money.
''It shows that the attorney general has extremely high standards when it comes to political fund-raising,'' Mr. Horner said, noting that Mr. Spitzer was under no legal obligation to give the money back.
Mr. Trump's case involved a dispute with a tenant who claimed that once a deal fell through, Mr. Trump was not entitled to keep a $643,775 down payment for a condominium in the Trump World Tower, near the United Nations.
Mr. Spitzer's office was involved through its real estate financing bureau, which has the authority to resolve disputes between apartment buyers and sellers regarding the right to funds placed in escrow.
The bureau determined that the entity seeking to retrieve the escrow, the Dunlop Development Corporation, had ''violated the terms of its contract and was not eligible to have its escrow deposit returned.''
Cindy Darrison, the managing director for Mr. Spitzer's campaign committee, said that the campaign had a system to avoid conflicts of interest, but that it had failed in this case. ''This process has worked well,'' she said, noting that the campaign has $4.2 million now.
''Occasionally, however, situations do arise in which donors may not be aware of an ongoing matter and, as a result, fail to disclose it to our office.''
In this case, Mr. Spitzer's office said it became aware of the situation on Monday when Scott Greathead, a lawyer for Dunlop Development, raised questions about the contributions and threatened legal action.
Mr. Spitzer has returned contributions from Mr. Trump before, according to campaign aides. In 1999, Mr. Trump gave him $10,000 that was returned when his office discovered that Mr. Trump had a different case before the attorney general.
Since then, Mr. Trump donated $11,000 in 2002 and $10,000 in 2003. Mr. Trump declined to comment, a spokeswoman said.
Trump Hotels and Casino Resorts Inc. said yesterday that it made a crucial $73.1 million debt payment that was coming due this weekend, giving the company a temporary respite from financial struggles that still threaten to force it into bankruptcy.
Trump Hotels, the centerpiece of Donald J. Trump's casino holdings, delayed payment of the debt when it originally came due on May 1, invoking a 30-day grace period.
Burdened with a $1.8 billion debt load and an inability to maintain or expand its Atlantic City operations adequately, Trump Hotels has been scrambling to rework its debt and raise outside capital.
One deal under consideration involves a $400 million cash infusion from Credit Suisse that would require Mr. Trump to reduce his equity stake in the company substantially and step aside as chief executive. Bondholders would also have to accept a reduction in the value of their debt holdings for the deal to go through.
Trump Hotels was required to use cash generated this month to meet the May debt payment, which means it will have a shorter period for building up cash before the next $73.1 million payment is due in November.
One person briefed on the financial position of Mr. Trump's two largest Atlantic City casinos, the Trump Taj Mahal and the Trump Plaza, said those casinos were entering the Memorial Day weekend with operating funds of about $20 million and $10 million, respectively. Those are perilously thin amounts given New Jersey regulations that insist on adequate cash cushions at casinos and the possibility that lucky gamblers could snare windfalls.
Scott C. Butera, executive vice president of Trump Hotels, declined to discuss the cash positions of the casinos, but said he was comfortable with their finances and was confident that the company would be able to meet its fall debt payment.
''Obviously, the summer months are our best months, and we're optimistic about the November payment,'' said Mr. Butera, who added that negotiations with bondholders had been ''active and constructive.''
Trump Hotels said this month that it lost $48.8 million, or $1.63 a share, in the first quarter, compared with a loss of $24 million, or $1.09 a share, a year earlier. In trading yesterday on the New York Stock Exchange, shares of Trump Hotels fell 4 cents, or 2 percent, to $1.93, well below the 52-week high of $3.65.
The possibility of a bankruptcy filing and a sell-off of shares has caused the company's total stock market value to be sliced by more than half in the last year. Trump Hotels has never been profitable since it became a public company in 1995.
While Trump Hotels is focused on meeting debt payments, its executives would prefer to rework the debt as soon as possible to escape a cash squeeze.
By making the debt payment yesterday, Mr. Trump may have bought himself some additional time to work out the complex restructuring agreement with bondholders and Credit Suisse.
Since the negotiations began in early April, bondholder representatives have been meeting with Trump Hotels executives, including Mr. Butera, as well as Steven Rattner, the financier leading the Credit Suisse team.
Although there was some hope a deal could be reached by the end of May, analysts say that expectation was ambitious and that Mr. Trump might have used the interest payment as a good will gesture to appease bondholders as he pursues more protracted negotiations.
''He may have withheld the coupon payment to try to get guys in line,'' said Jane Pedreira, a bond analyst at Lehman Brothers who covers Trump Hotels. ''So it signals to me that the dialogue is positive and progressing.''
Nonetheless, getting all of the parties to agree will remain a complex process, especially given the deep distrust many bondholders retain toward Mr. Trump because of the contentious relationship he has had with them in recent years.
One bondholder, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, voiced frustration yesterday with the restructuring talks and said he hoped an outside takeover offer might be made for Trump Hotels.
''It would be the happiest day of my life if I could repossess his hotels and sell them to Carl Icahn,'' the bondholder added. ''I would love to say, 'Mr. Trump, you've had your chance.'''
To the Editor:
Re ''Aiming for Hit Games, Films Come Up Short'' (May 27), on the limited appeal of many video games based on movies: I disagree with some of your information.
After you have seen a movie that you enjoyed, you like to test your skills the same way that the main characters did. There are games in which the creator expands on what you learn in the movie. For instance, in Van Helsing you have to fight gargoyles and druids, which does not happen in the movie. I am 10 years old, and I have consulted friends about this.

New York
Last spring, Donald J. Trump created a pop culture sensation when he had 16 aspiring moguls vie for his approval on the NBC reality television hit, ''The Apprentice.''
Now, he has tapped a tycoon to try to replicate the success of the original in England, the first step in plans to spin the series off to more than a dozen countries. But like any other world-class brand that hopes to expand abroad, Mr. Trump faces a classic problem of globalizing: how to export a product -- in this case himself -- around the world without offending local sensibilities.
Sir Alan M. Sugar, the entrepreneur and self-made billionaire described by some as iconoclastic, will soon be occupying a boardroom in London, assigning menial tasks to aspiring junior executives, then firing them one by one until declaring a winner, who will get a six-figure salary running one of Sir Alan's companies.
But Sir Alan, who has built Amstrad, a large consumer electronics company and owns a large amount of commercial real estate, , said that his version of ''The Apprentice'' will be ''less schmaltzy'' and ''less glitzy'' than the American show, with a greater emphasis on practical business lessons and a more intense boardroom interview session before eliminating candidates each week.
''I am a great realist and very straight forward,'' Sir Alan warned in an interview. ''You get it right between the eyes from me. You don't get any flowers or niceties.''
Some situations the aspiring British executives face will differ from those that have confronted their American counterparts.
In the American version, for example, Mr. Trump oversaw the contestants in a series of challenges like running a celebrity auction or hawking lemonade on busy Manhattan sidewalks. In the British show, Sir Alan will test his contestants' entrepreneurial savvy by seeing who can sell the most ice cream in London -- without refrigeration -- before it melts.
The prospect of eliminating an ambitious youngster each week does not appear to bother him. ''We are not running a holiday camp here,'' he said.
A 100-page production guide would have Sir Alan continue to use Mr. Trump's characteristic ''You're fired!'' in knocking a contestant off the show, but he is not sure that he will use the phrase.
''We are obliged to use that catch phrase, 'You're fired!''' Sir Alan said. ''We would normally use the term, in England, 'You're sacked!''' Mr. Trump said that his personal catch phrase is explicitly advised in order to preserve the integrity of the series, though there may be some room for cultural adjustments.
''We don't want anything to happen with this great franchise,'' Mr. Trump said. That said, Mr. Trump seems uncharacteristically content with the prospect of another mogul leaving his stamp on a role he originated.
''I solve my ego problems two ways,'' Mr. Trump said. ''No.1, it is another country. No.2, Mark Burnett and I are 50-50 partners in the franchise so we want it to do well.''
Mr. Trump and Mark Burnett Productions own both the original American series and the international rights to rebroadcast the first season as well as rights to the format, so that local versions of the program can be made overseas only with their permission. The deal with the British Broadcasting Corporation provides for both a flat licensing fee and a share of future profits. Mr. Trump said he and his partner expect to reap several million dollars from each sale.
Sir Alan's version will begin filming this summer and is scheduled to be on BBC 2 in January, after the first season of the American series, starring Mr. Trump, runs in England this fall. Other local formats, with home-grown versions of Mr. Trump, are scheduled for production in at least 15 countries, including China, France, Lebanon, South Africa and Turkey. In many cases, international producers were required to purchase the American version before a local entrepreneur could step into Mr. Trump's shoes.
''They all wanted the American version,'' Mr. Trump said. ''It's a really good show, and it is Donald Trump. What can I tell you?''
Even without Mr. Trump, the excitement surrounding the British series has already led more than 3,000 aspiring contestants to sign up for the chance to study at Sir Alan's business school of hard knocks. ''Sir Alan stands as the perfect role model for people who haven't had a college education, but have succeeded through their hard work and endeavor,'' said Peter Moore, the executive producer of the British version of The Apprentice. ''We don't need to worship at the feet of Donald Trump.''
Though not well known outside Britain, Sir Alan has established a reputation among electronics retailers for having a prickly personality and razor-sharp wit.
''I saw him on many occasions cause someone to shut up and turn white,'' said Sir Stanley Kalms, the former chairman of Dixons, one of the Britain's large consumer electronics dealers and a longtime buyer of the inexpensive computer equipment and telephone gadgets Sir Alan has sold. Lord Kalms said that he has dueled with Sir Alan over the last 20 years in several ''torturous and ugly negotiations'' but nonetheless calls him a respectable adversary and loyal friend.
''If you are weak, you will burst into tears,'' he said. ''If you are strong, you will see his humor.''
Mr. Moore said that he had considered other entrepreneurs, but ruled them all out. Sir Richard Branson, the brash head of the Virgin Group, was disqualified because he had already signed on to star in a reality series on Fox.
Given Sir Alan's outspoken support of entrepreneurship, he seemed the obvious choice. He was dubbed a knight a few years ago for his business achievements, Mr. Moore said, and his rag-to-riches life story gave him an ''acceptable face of capitalism.''
Of course, it also did not hurt that Sir Alan was willing to volunteer his services. Unlike Mr. Trump, who boasts that his deal with NBC makes him the ''highest-paid person'' in prime-time television, Sir Alan sees his gig as an extension of his government work, and will be sacking (that is, firing) his contestants for free. ''Personally, I have made more money than I will spend in my lifetime,'' Sir Alan said.
Despite what will likely be a similar approach in the television boardroom, Sir Alan's real-life trajectory can be viewed in stark contrast to Mr. Trump's path. Mr. Trump, 57, grew up the son of a wealthy real estate man and attended the Wharton School of Business on his way to becoming one of New York City's biggest developers.
Sir Alan, 57, was born into a poor family in London's working class East End. He skipped university and went straight to work so he could bring home extra money. At age 21, having wandered through jobs as varied as an ironworks statistician and a car radio salesman, he started his own company, Alan Michael Sugar Trading, known as Amstrad, from scratch.
''I had very little money and had to buy and sell for cash,'' Sir Alan recalled. ''I could not get credit.'' Thirty years later, Amstrad has grown from a supplier of retractable car antennas into a large public company that sells inexpensive satellite receivers, and Internet-ready telephones. As chairman and chief executive officer, Sir Alan remains at the helm.
Like Mr. Trump, Sir Alan has ventured into other enterprises with mixed results. He currently dishes out business advice as a columnist for The Daily Mirror, the British tabloid. He also owns an executive jet business; Viglen, a company that sells computer equipment to schools; and a minority stake in the Tottenham Hotspur Football Club, the British Premier league soccer team he supported since his youth and rescued from financial ruin if not on-field distress.
Though, as with Mr. Trump, it is difficult to put a precise value on Sir Alan's holdings, he is typically described as a billionaire. Unlike Mr. Trump, Sir Alan seems unconcerned with such things.
''The net worth thing is a very subjective topic,'' he wrote in reply to an e-mail message asking about his net worth. He then suggested that people simply pick a number between $750 million and $1.5 billion, ''stick your finger in the air to see which way the wind is blowing and print what you come up with.''
Sir Alan offered another suggestion, perhaps for Mr. Burnett and Mr. Trump to consider, suggesting a reality show ''that gets all these so called billionaires together and catches them off guard'' and asks them to write out a check for $185 million ''that when presented to the bank now would get paid,'' he wrote in an e-mail. ''I think you will see a few embarrassed faces.''
The crime scene seemed to be as secure as an investigator could hope for: a locked psychiatric ward in which the presence of every patient and staff member is monitored. A 15-year-old mentally handicapped girl had been sexually assaulted for hours, and left with a mutilated vagina, bruises across her body and a damaged bladder.
But the investigation, here at St. Vincent's Westchester Hospital, was not so simple.
The police officer who arrived at the hospital cited a lack of cooperation by a doctor and a hospital official, and the officer did not conduct basic forensic work.
The difficulties are not unusual at St. Vincent's, said Capt. Anthony Marraccini of the Harrison police; officials there usually cite patient privacy laws.
''It often takes us days to get to a crime scene in the hospital, and they often will not even tell us if suspects are in the facility,'' Captain Marraccini said.
In any case of sexual assault, he said, the scene of the crime can yield invaluable evidence for prosecution. ''It makes all the difference to quickly access a crime scene.''
The first arrest in the case -- one of two patients in the locked room with the girl -- came nine months after the assault. The girl's parents are suing the hospital.
The police and hospital officials say the incident, which took place on Aug. 14 of last year, highlights the difficulties faced in balancing criminal investigations with the protections provided by privacy laws related to health care.
Captain Marraccini said the restrictions cited by hospital officials have led to antagonistic encounters in many of the 17 cases of alleged sexual assaults that officers have been called to investigate there since 2000.
''In a way, St. Vincent's is like a separate country with separate laws that they govern it by,'' he said. ''There are times I have been tempted to arrest hospital officials for obstructing a criminal investigation.''
Relations with the police on an institutional level remain cordial, but officers investigating crimes have encountered difficulties with individual staff members at the hospital, said the Harrison chief of police, David R. Hall.
''In my view, St. Vincent's as an institution has been highly cooperative with the police,'' Chief Hall said. ''Have there been doctors up there who have done things they should not have done? Yes.''
The hospital emphasized the high quality of care delivered and its desire to cooperate with the police.
''This is not a snake pit, this is not 'One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest,''' said Spencer Eth, the medical director and senior vice president of the hospital. ''People are not in danger when they seek treatment here.''
Dr. Eth said incidents do occur at the hospital, but investigations are always conducted.
''We are in the business of giving care, not making money from lawsuits,'' Dr. Eth said. ''This is not a case of patient abuse, it is a case of hospital abuse.''
The girl's stay at St. Vincent's was the first time in her life that she had spent a night away from family members. Her parents and sisters, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said that the girl suffers from multiple mental and physical disabilities and that they went to extraordinary lengths to reassure her about being away from the family.
By last August, her self-confidence had grown to where she could stay alone in a room for nearly an hour, and her parents said doctors were impressed that they had helped her to the developmental level of a 5- year-old through nurturing at home.
But when a doctor was faced with the delicate task of rebalancing her many medicines, he persuaded the parents to place the girl in the temporary care of St. Vincent's.
Her parents said they were assured that she would be under constant supervision at the four-story brick hospital, which has a 125-year history of caring for patients with psychiatric problems. The hospital's floors, one of which was recently emptied so that a reporter could tour it, run in a V shape away from a glass-encased nurses' station. The rooms, designed to minimize the danger of patients injuring themselves, have bolted windows, no ceiling fixtures, no heavy chairs and no curtain rods. Bathrooms are communal and the many paintings that line the halls -- soothing country scenes and images of jazz musicians -- are bolted to the wall.
Despite these precautions, in the 36 hours that she was out of her parents' care, the girl suffered what an examining doctor from another hospital told her parents was a ''vicious sexual assault.''
The girl described to her parents, the examining doctor and later in videotaped testimony, how her two roommates ''danced like on MTV'' with each other before sexually assaulting her more than half a dozen times over a two-hour period. Locked in the room with her assailants, she said, the girls threatened to take her away from her family forever if she described what happened.
An orderly opened the door at one point because of the noise, shouting at the girls to be quiet, the mother said.
Shortly after the attack, which took place during the quiet time after lunch, the girl's parents arrived for visiting hours and found their daughter ''half naked and acting like a zombie,'' they said. Not suspecting that she had been attacked and fearing that their presence was upsetting their daughter, the parents left the hospital.
Soon after midnight, however, a call came from a doctor saying that their daughter had been sexually assaulted and that they should come and collect her in the morning.
In an account told by the mother and corroborated by the police report about the incident, the doctor who made the call, Maurizio Zambenedetti, declined to speak with the officer brought to the hospital by the parents and refused to give information about possible suspects.
The Harrison police officer wrote in the report that both Dr. Zambenedetti and another hospital official ''would not cooperate with this officer.''
Contacted by telephone, Dr. Zambenedetti declined to comment on the incident.
A hospital spokesman, Michael Fagan, said that since the family arrived at 3 a.m., and the staff members on the shift when the attack occurred were gone, the police were invited to return the next day.
''They offered to have the police return when the relevant people who were there would speak to the police,'' Mr. Fagan said. ''To the best of my knowledge, the police did not return.''
For investigating any sexual assault, Captain Marraccini of the Harrison police said, the crime scene presents a strong base from which to construct an effective prosecution. ''The case can be very strong when you take hair samples, check for pubic hairs, signs of a struggle or skin samples under the fingernails of a suspect,'' Captain Marraccini said. ''In this case all we have now are the injuries suffered by the girl and a physical assessment by a doctor at another facility.''
If patient privacy laws prevent the police from seeing who is staying at the hospital, Captain Marraccini said, the police could wait a few hours while the relevant floors were evacuated.
''They could lock down the floor, seal off the crime scene and give access to police once the patients are off,'' Captain Marraccini said. ''The way they acted, we were blocked at the very first step, with even the doctor reporting the crime refusing to talk with police.''
St. Vincent's Westchester, a private hospital, is accredited by the Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations and licensed by the New York State Office of Mental Health and the New York State Office of Alcoholism and Substance Abuse Services.
For state-run facilities, the standard procedures are clear, according to Roger Klingman, a spokesman for the Office of Mental Health.
''When there is an allegation of a crime at a state-run facility, we report it to the police, allow access to the crime scene and the police investigation takes precedence over our own internal investigation,'' Mr. Klingman said. ''Nothing in the mental hygiene law prevents police from investigating a crime.'' The police cannot get instant access to medical records, Mr. Klingman added, but such information can be obtained by the district attorney, even in cases of patient-on-patient abuse.
''Our policy is to never be adversarial with police,'' Mr. Klingman said. The New York State Office of Mental Health, which runs more than two-dozen state psychiatric centers while licensing and regulating more than 100 inpatient psychiatric programs, is running a joint investigation with the Department of Health into allegations of patient abuse at the hospital, Mr. Klingman said.
As for the August attack in the St. Vincent's psychiatric ward, the Westchester district attorney, Jeanine F. Pirro, has charged Wanda Green, 18, on 42 counts, including 12 counts of sexual abuse in the first degree.
The indictment alleges that Ms. Green and a 15-year-old fellow roommate subjected the girl to forcible sexual contact. The other roommate, whose identity cannot be revealed because of her age, pleaded guilty, while Ms. Green still awaits trial.
Correction Appended
SIXTEEN people competed fiercely on national television for a chance to become Donald Trump's apprentice. After all, even the losers received national television exposure, and the winner was rewarded with a job paying $250,000 a year.
Less clear is why 27 unemployed people would spend nearly a month competing for a $40,000-a-year entry-level job as a junior programmer in the Jersey City offices of Maple Securities U.S.A.
During the contest, which was held in February, the candidates helped to set up their own training space; learned an arcane computer language called A.P.L. (A Programming Language); and performed a series of complex programming tasks on tight deadlines.
The competition was the brainchild of Brooke Allen, the head of the statistical arbitrage group at Maple Securities.
Mr. Allen is a devotee of A.P.L., which is considered a dead language by many programming enthusiasts, but is cherished by the ''geekiest of the geeks,'' according to one practitioner.
Mr. Allen devised a behavioral finance game to simulate what he called ''common irrational'' behaviors of stock market participants, and he wanted to hire a junior programmer to maintain it.
''People understood they were taking a risk and could drop out any time,'' he said. ''No one gave off a sense of desperation.''
Some workplace experts said that hiring practices like Mr. Allen's were unusual, but that they resembled the ''try and buy'' approach that some employers use to test candidates before hiring them full time.
In many companies, including The New York Times, potential employees are given a tryout or a series of assignments to help determine the quality of their work and whether they fit into the office culture. Robert I. Sutton, a professor of management science and engineering at Stanford University and the author of ''Weird Ideas That Work: 11 1/2 Practices for Promoting, Managing and Sustaining Innovation'' (The Free Press, 2002), said he had seen far worse hiring practices than Mr. Allen's.
''It's better than what you see in the average corporation,'' Dr. Sutton said. ''Everyone knew upfront about the risks when they signed on.''
Other experts, however, described extended job tryouts as bordering on exploitive. ''Looking for a job is stressful and demanding work in a recovering economy,'' said Joanne Murray, a management consultant and the director of the Center for Work and Service at Wellesley College, ''and I question the advisability of devoting so much time to something like this. Not paying someone for that much time is also problematic.''
Mr. Allen may not have been required to pay the Maple Securities job candidates because he was giving them an opportunity to learn A.P.L., according to Lawrence Z. Lorber, a lawyer specializing in labor and employment law at Proskauer Rose in Washington.
Mr. Lorber said that in general, companies offering extended job tryouts were required to compensate participants, while those offering education were not.
Several other employers have recently experimented with their own ''try and buy'' hiring based on the tactics used on reality shows like ''The Apprentice'' and ''Survivor.''
In May, the Stamford, Conn., office of the Regus Group, a provider of office space, began a three-month competition among eight paid interns for a chance at a full-time job. The company would not say how much that job would pay.
''You'd have to be under a rock not to feel the buzz of 'The Apprentice,''' said Shari Aponte, a company spokeswoman. ''We thought this would be a clever way for attracting additional candidates to our program, and we've received great publicity. We don't want to criticize or demean anyone.''
She said that the interns work on ''entrepreneurial'' projects involving sales analysis and creative design and that they are reviewed weekly by senior management.
The Maple Securities recruiting effort began in January, when Mr. Allen ran a newspaper ad describing the kind of person he was looking for. He received 300 responses. He invited the 300 to download a 500-page computer manual on A.P.L. and an accompanying quiz. The 38 applicants who returned the quiz were given a chance to learn the language and take a chance at one or possibly more available positions.
By the end of the three-week training period, only 13 candidates remained. Mr. Allen ultimately hired two programmers from the tryout program, one for $40,000 and another for nearly twice that amount.
Mr. Allen decided to help the ''surplus'' programmers whom he could not hire. So he introduced the remaining applicants at a New York City A.P.L. conference in March, in the hope that other employers might hire them. At least two of those applicants found jobs related to their A.P.L. experience and the contacts they made at the March conference.
Mr. Allen described the program as an unconventional hiring strategy with benefits both for the employer, the employees who were ultimately hired and even those who were not.
Not every applicant was happy with the process. Tony Bozanich, 28, an unemployed programmer with a master's degree, attended several weeks of A.P.L. training before dropping out. He had been looking for a job for about four months before he saw Mr. Allen's cryptic ad and decided to take a chance.
''Going to those sessions was like watching a train wreck in slow motion,'' Mr. Bozanich said. It was, he said, ''a testament to the bad economy that so many overqualified people would come in for one lousy programming trainee position.''
Mr. Bozanich said he thought Mr. Allen was genuinely motivated to help the trainees find work, but he also considered the process inevitably exploitive.
Ben Dattner, an adjunct professor of organizational psychology at New York University, said that while employers using extended tryouts need to be candid with candidates about whatever methods and criteria they are using, some applicants might view these types of job competitions as more enjoyable than exploitive.
That was the case for Karine Ng, who was part of a job competition last September modeled on ''Survivor'' at DiMassimo Brand Advertising in New York. Ms. Ng was one of 10 people who participated in a weeklong competition for an entry-level advertising job. The group worked on making pitches and it devised a promotional campaign for Crunch Fitness. Every night, management voted two contestants out.
Ms. Ng survived four days before she was asked to leave. Though disappointed, she called the experience a win-win situation. DiMassimo, she said, gained more insight into candidates, and she received some on-the job training and made contacts. DiMassimo referred her to Jericho Public Relations, where she is now an account coordinator.
But Ms. Murray of Wellesley College warns that a job contest may be a sign that a cutthroat work culture awaits prospective employees.
''It's a statement of culture and values and not to be taken lightly,'' she said. ''The job search process is something that should not be made cavalier.''
Correction: July 4, 2004, Sunday A byline is omitted today on an article in the Job Market section about a competition for an entry-level job as a junior computer programmer. The writer is David Koeppel.
At various stages of this season, Kazuo Matsui has changed his swing, his throwing motion and his place in the lineup. The Mets gave him a pair of prescription goggles, a new batting coach and his first day off in more than 1,200 professional games.
Manager Art Howe brought Matsui into his office for a series of pep talks. Coaches spent extra time with him before games. Teammates bowed in his direction to encourage him. No matter what they tried, the Mets could not solve the mystery of Matsui.
Perhaps he only needed to hear the words of a master motivator to receive a dose of tough love from the nation's most notorious boss.
When Donald Trump appeared on a sponsored segment of ESPN's ''SportsCenter'' on June 30, Matsui was hitting .254, appearing anemic at the plate, committing errors at a rapid rate. He was the easiest target imaginable.
The host, Dan Patrick, asked Trump to name the athlete or manager he would most like to fire. Trump stalled for a moment, tried to give a diplomatic answer, then could not help but fire away. ''I would certainly say Kaz Matsui of the Mets has been a bust,'' he said. ''There's no doubt about that.''
For a player who had already taken plenty of local criticism and had even been booed at Shea Stadium, Trump's dig might have been the most cutting comment of all. The clip played and replayed on television sets at Great American Ballpark in Cincinnati, where the Mets were visiting that night. It was broadcast around the country and in other parts of the world.
Matsui said through his interpreter on Friday that he did not know anything about Trump and had absolutely no idea about his critique. But in the days after Trump took his jab, Matsui has delivered his own kind of rebuttal, intelligible in any language.
Coincidence or not, from the night Trump's segment aired, Matsui has enjoyed his best stretch since moving from Japan to the major leagues. He has gone 17 for 43, hit two home runs in a game for the first time, set a career high with three hits in a game -- and then repeated that feat the very next night. Matsui has a nine-game hitting streak after Friday night's 6-3 victory at in Florida and, beginning with June 30, the night of the broadcast, was hitting .395.
Trump did not return phone calls Friday because he, like Matsui, was on a business trip.
''I have been feeling good lately,'' Matsui said through his interpreter. ''But I'm not playing to prove anything to anybody. I'm just trying to prove something to myself. What I've done in the past couple weeks is the result of my believing in myself and wanting to do everything I can.''
Matsui maintains that his drastic improvement has come from some subtle adjustments he has made to his swing.
Howe suggests that Matsui has performed better because the Mets have been playing in front of larger crowds, stoking his intensity. Some coaches say he has benefited from getting out of the leadoff spot and moving into the No. 2 hole.
No one gives any credit to Trump, but given how many assorted methods the Mets tried to jump-start Matsui, it is hard to say what exactly made the difference. This is a player who is so superstitious that he wears silver beads around his ankles in an attempt to harness good fortune. Now, maybe Matsui will start watching ''The Apprentice.''
More likely, he will continue firing back in his own quiet way.
The anticipation was huge for the dream matchup in the men's shot-put finals of the United States Olympic track and field trials on Saturday.
The four shot-putters with the best efforts of the year were here, contending for three Olympic berths. All had bettered 71 feet this year, and no one else in the world had even reached 70 feet. They had all won world or Pan American Games championships or Olympic medals.
John Godina, the most experienced and most honored of the four, predicted that someone would reach 72 feet here and still not make the team. Almost everyone agreed that Christian Cantwell, the youngest of the four at 23 and the world leader with an effort of 73 feet 11 1/2 inches last month, was sure to make it.
Everyone turned out to be a bad prophet. There was only one 70-foot put all day, and the odd man out was Cantwell, who fouled five times in his six attempts.
Adam Nelson, who won the 2000 Olympic trials and the Olympic silver medal that year, won here with 71 feet on his fifth attempt. Reese Hoffa, who figured to be the odd man out, finished second at 69-4 1/4. Godina, who has won three world titles outdoors and one indoors, took third at 69-2.
Cantwell, at 23 the 6-foot-6, 290-pound baby of the group, was barely fourth with 67-5 1/2 on his only fair attempt.
Cantwell was more than gracious in defeat.
''There are two great thrills in this sport: winning and losing,'' he said minutes later. ''I picked a bad day to have a bad day. I don't know what happened. It was like I'd never been in the ring before. Whenever I looked up, I was standing outside the ring.
''I hadn't had a problem like that in three years. I don't have a clue why I was fouling.''
Athletes in many track and field events say the pressure is greater in the trials than in the Olympics themselves. But Cantwell insisted he did not fold under the adversity.
''I've been in big competitions before,'' he said. ''I won the world indoor championship. I don't have a clue what happened today. It wasn't a lack of confidence. It was just not my day. This is definitely the low point of my year. I have no excuses. They may hang me when I get home, but this is not the end.''
Godina said he had seen intense competitions like this before.
''There were too many good people making others tight,'' he said. ''Actually, this was a good thing because it showed people what it would be like in the Olympics.''
Hoffa and Cantwell have never competed in the Olympics.
Cantwell's conquerors were surprised and sympathetic.
''I was shocked,'' Nelson said. ''He's certainly the most powerful, and he has been throwing so consistently so long. This will put a fire in his belly.''
Godina said of Cantwell: ''I thought he was a shoo-in. This shows why we have the trials. I sympathize with him because I was in his shoes four years ago. I don't wish that upon anybody.''
In the 2000 Olympic trials in the same stadium, Godina finished fourth. He backed onto the team when C.J. Hunter bowed out, saying he was injured. Godina went on to win a bronze medal in Sydney; it was announced later that Hunter had tested positive for steroids.
''John didn't make the team in 2000 and he was graceful in defeat,'' Cantwell said. ''I hope I can be graceful, too.''
INSIDE TRACK
Shelia Burrell held off Tiffany Lott-Hogan to win the heptathlon, 6,194 points to 6,159. Burrell was second in the long jump and javelin on Saturday.
Trump Hotels and Casino Resorts Inc., the flagship of Donald J. Trump's debt-laden casino holdings, reported increased losses for the second quarter and a dwindling supply of cash yesterday, leaving the struggling company in an increasingly perilous financial position.
Beginning with Memorial Day weekend, the summer season typically is the most lucrative for casino companies because more people are on vacation and looking to gamble. But Trump Hotels lost $17.6 million, or 59 cents a share, in the quarter, compared with a loss of $10 million, or 46 cents a share, in the same quarter last year.
More ominously, Trump Hotels' cash reserves -- which it needs to help reduce its $1.8 billion in debts -- are shrinking. The company says it has $81.1 million on hand, down from $124.3 million in the first quarter of the year.
Trump Hotels had $106 million in cash on hand at the end of the second quarter last year.
Although Mr. Trump enjoyed a star turn as a business guru on the hit television show ''The Apprentice,'' his casino company has never been profitable since going public in 1995. Trump Hotels, with casinos concentrated in Atlantic City, has been flirting with bankruptcy protection this year, scrambling to make a last-minute, $73.1 million debt payment in May. A similar payment is due in November.
Trump Hotels is talking with its bondholders about restructuring its debts, two people briefed on the negotiations say. One plan under consideration involves a $400 million cash infusion from the Credit Suisse Group that would greatly reduce Mr. Trump's equity stake in the company and force him to step aside as chief executive.
Bondholders would also have to accept a loss for the deal to go through.
''It's been a multidimensional chess game,'' said one of the people who had been briefed on the talks. ''If you think about the complexities, with all the different groups, pulling them all together hasn't been quick.''
Addressing his company's slumping profits, Mr. Trump said in an interview that rising gas prices had cut into gamblers' budgets in the second quarter. ''Maybe the high rollers won't use their jets,'' he said. ''For people who drive their automobiles, it certainly has a an impact on the amount of money they have when they reach their destinations.''
More important, he said that his company's earnings were hurt by gamblers who were winning more money than usual. Trump Hotels said in a news release that the ''hold percentage'' at its table games, a measure of how much money a casino rakes in from losing gamblers, fell substantially in the quarter.
''We consider ourselves to be very open to having people win,'' Mr. Trump said. ''It's bad for me but it brings other people. It can even out over the course of a year.''
Scott C. Butera, executive vice president of Trump Hotels, said that unusually lucky gamblers, combined with broader economic factors, ''all played a role'' in undermining the company's performance, particularly in May and June. He said he was surprised by the downturn in those months but declined to comment on the company's performance so far in July. While noting that other Atlantic City casinos were also experiencing a weaker summer, Mr. Butera acknowledged that Trump Hotels' challenges remain greater than most because of its anemic finances.
''Other companies have more capital and a better ability to market,'' he said. ''It's a question of how many resources you have to work with.''
Mr. Trump said that he expected his casinos to perform better in July and August because late summer is typically Atlantic City's busiest season. But the long-term prospects of Trump Hotels remain doubtful. Pennsylvania recently legalized slot machine gambling in 14 locations in the state, and that could drain gamblers from Atlantic City. Trump Hotels may face better-financed casino rivals if recently announced mergers of Harrah's Entertainment Inc. with Caesars Entertainment Inc., and MGM Mirage with the Mandalay Resort Group, are completed. Mr. Trump's company said it had already lost business to the Borgata Hotel Casino and Spa, a high-end enterprise that opened in Atlantic City last summer and is co-owned by MGM Mirage and the Boyd Gaming Corporation.
Trump Hotels said that it lost $66.4 million, or $2.22 a share, for the six-month period ended June 30, compared with a loss of $34.0 million, or $1.55 a share, for the same period last year. Trump Hotels' shares are very thinly traded and investors had a muted response to the company's earnings announcement. The shares closed at $2.06, down a penny, on lower than usual trading volume yesterday.
Mr. Trump, whose personal net worth is notoriously difficult to evaluate, voiced some confusion yesterday about his stake in Trump Hotels, part of which he holds directly and part of which he controls through a limited partnership. He initially said yesterday that he had a 41 percent stake in Trump Hotels. In March, he said in an interview that he had a 49 percent stake. Asked whether he had sold stock in the interim, he said he had not. After revisiting the topic with his advisers, he said he actually holds about 56 percent of Trump Hotels' shares -- a stake worth about $34.5 million.
Mr. Trump said that the Republican convention, which might draw fresh crowds into the New York region next month, should have a ''big impact'' on his company's bottom line in the next quarter.
Need advice on hiring a butler? Buying an island? Bedding down in Bora Bora? You're in luck. Donald J. Trump is starting a magazine.
Following in the footsteps of Martha Stewart and Oprah Winfrey, Mr. Trump will lend his name to a magazine focused on his personal interests. Trump World, a bimonthly, will start next month with an initial run of 200,000 copies. It will be free to those who bunk in his hotel and residential properties, and cost $5.95 at newsstands.
Michael Jacobson, Trump World's editor and publisher, said the magazine would feature Mr. Trump's business and real-estate advice, as well as helpful hints on spending the riches that result.
The model Caprice Bourret is on the cover of the pilot issue, and that seemed fine with Mr. Trump. ''I was just on the cover of every magazine in existence,'' he said, in jest. ''I'd like to keep a very low profile. I do try, but sometimes it doesn't always work out that way.'' Eric Dash
Trump Hotels and Casino Resorts, the centerpiece of Donald J. Trump's faltering casino holdings, said last night that it planned to file for bankruptcy protection by the end of September. The company hopes the move will allow it to reorganize under new management and with new financing that will ease its $1.8 billion debt burden.
Under the terms of the agreement reached with Trump Hotels' bondholders, Mr. Trump will step aside as chief executive and his 56 percent equity stake will be reduced to about 25 percent. For Mr. Trump to hold onto that stake, he will be required to make a series of investments in the company, including a $55 million cash investment and an exchange of Trump Hotels debt that he owns.
Mr. Trump will remain as chairman and, in a nod to the marketing muscle retained by the host of the television show ''The Apprentice,'' cede to the recapitalized company ''a perpetual and exclusive worldwide trademark license, royalty free, to use his name and likeness and all related marks and intellectual property rights.''
The prospective bankruptcy filing is a stunning comedown for a man who helped reignite the gambling boom in Atlantic City about two decades ago and whose name has become synonymous with business savvy, even though his casinos have never been profitable since first going public in 1995 and have been widely criticized by analysts as poorly run.
Credit Suisse First Boston, the investment bank that has been working on a restructuring of Trump Hotels for several months, plans to invest $345 million in the reorganized company. Trump Hotels said that if all elements of the reorganization fell into place, Trump Hotels' publicly traded debt would drop to about $1.25 billion from $1.8 billion and its interest rates on that debt would be reduced to an annual rate of 7.875 percent from 12 percent.
The company said debt restructuring would reduce its annual interest payments by about $110.2 million -- much needed financial breathing room for a company increasingly short on cash and surrounded by better-financed and better-managed competitors. Trump Hotels also said it planned to arrange for up to $100 million in debtor-in-possession financing once the company files for bankruptcy.
Trump Hotels said it planned to file for bankruptcy protection under Chapter 11, which, unlike a Chapter 7 bankruptcy, does not mean the company is going out of business. Rather, a Chapter 11 filing gives a company that still holds potential promise an opportunity to right itself.
Trump Hotels said it expected its recapitalization plan to be completed by the first quarter of 2005.
''I have had a wonderful longstanding working relationship with CSFB, and I am proud to be able to partner with them,'' Mr. Trump said in a statement last night. ''I look forward to our recapitalized company being a major player in the evolving gaming industry.''
Under the agreement, one group of Mr. Trump's bondholders would exchange $1.3 billion in debt for about $228.2 million in cash, about $852 million in new debt and about $107 million in the reorganized company's stock. Another group of bondholders would exchange about $406 million in debt for about $56 million in cash and $350 million in new notes. Yet a third group would swap $68.8 million in debt for about $500,000 in cash, $48 million in new notes, and $15.7 million in the reorganized company's stock.
Trump Hotels recently reported a second-quarter loss of $17.6 million, or 59 cents a share, compared with a loss of $10 million, or 46 cents a share, in the period a year earlier -- one yardstick of just how badly the company has been performing. Moreover, Trump Hotels' cash reserves are shrinking. The company said in its quarterly filing that it has $81.1 million on hand, down from $124.3 million in the first quarter of the year. The company had $106 million in cash on hand at the end of the second quarter last year.
In an interview last night, Scott C. Butera, executive vice president of Trump Hotels, declined to say exactly when a reorganization agreement was reached with bondholders but said that disclosure of the agreement was made in a timely fashion consistent with regulatory requirements.
The news that Trump Hotels and Casino Resorts intends to seek bankruptcy protection elicited little sympathy from gamblers on Tuesday, as they went about their normal routines at the three Trump casino resorts here.
Most gamblers interviewed were unaware that the company's colorful chairman, Donald J. Trump, had announced he would no longer call the shots at the Trump Marina, Plaza and Taj Mahal as part of his company's planned bankruptcy reorganization. But once informed, none of them said the change would affect their casino habits to any great extent.
''Other than a stockholder, who would care?'' asked Wellington Brown of Newark, who was gambling at the Trump Plaza on Tuesday afternoon with a friend, Robert Hall, also of Newark.
Mr. Brown added that he doubted the bankruptcy would have much impact even on Mr. Trump. ''He's just protecting his assets. He's better off after bankruptcy than before,'' said Mr. Brown, who visits Atlantic City four or five times a year. Although he held no sympathy for Mr. Trump, Mr. Brown said he favored the Trump Plaza because it was quieter than some of the newer upscale casinos like the Borgata Hotel Casino and Spa. He gave the casino owners credit for bringing Atlantic City back to life.
''It's a 30-year work in progress and it is still changing,'' he said. ''I think Trump will get out of the casino business eventually. He's better at building big buildings and collecting rent. Running a hotel is a tough business.
''How many places can you run before you're killing yourself with competition?'' he added. Although the Trump properties, which are in older buildings, appear to be in good shape, with little of the wear and tear that financial problems can sometimes create, a ceiling tile collapsed while Mr. Brown and Mr. Hall were standing in the hallway talking, and water cascaded to the floor.
Kathryn Heebner of Reading, Pa., said she saw no ill effects from the company's financial problems and predicted that little would change at the Trump Plaza, which she was visiting with her son Robert.
''It's a paper move to protect themselves. It doesn't matter to us. We go all over to the other casinos, but we start here at the Plaza and we end here.''
Robert said his mother always seemed to be luckier at the Plaza, and that accounted for their return visits.
At the Trump Marina, on the edge of the casino district away from the more active Boardwalk properties, the presence of the luxurious Borgata seemed to register more acutely.
Andy and Debbie Miller, who were visiting from a suburb of Philadelphia, said that they frequented the Trump Marina, which is a short distance from the Borgata, because of the good deals offered there on rooms.
''I haven't seen any sign of the casino going downhill, but you have to go to the Borgata,'' he advised a listener. ''That's Vegas in New Jersey. Some people -- like Trump -- do casinos well, but some, like the Borgata, do it even better. If you can afford to stay at the Borgata, you're not going to stay anywhere else.''
Despite their reservations about the Marina, the Millers liked the Trump properties well enough to be seen a short time later going into the Trump Plaza. But their sympathy was not stirred by the financial problems facing Mr. Trump's company.
''He's bankrupt -- yeah -- I feel real sorry for him,'' Mr. Miller said.
For Vince and Jane Mangiamele of the Poconos in Pennsylvania, the atmosphere is what draws them to the Trump Marina.
''The people are friendlier here,'' Ms. Mangiamele said, ''but I don't care about Mr. Trump. We saw him here a few months ago and he wouldn't even say hello to us.''
Mr. Trump has not won the heart of Joan White of Philadelphia, either.
''I don't care if he goes bankrupt; he's arrogant and I don't like his television show either. But they have better slot machines here,'' she said. ''He's got that gorgeous house in Florida, so he's not really going bankrupt, not like we would.''
As Donald J. Trump's publicly traded casino company, Trump Hotels and Casino Resorts, goes into a bankruptcy reorganization, Mr. Trump has to invest $55 million of his money in the enterprise to maintain a large ownership stake.
But does he have it?
In an interview yesterday, as in many interviews before, Mr. Trump pegged his net worth at $4 billion to $5 billion, a figure that suggests he could easily chip $55 million into the reorganization of the casino that bears his name.
''It's cash I have on hand,'' Mr. Trump said. ''I'm very, very liquid.''
In fact, it is nearly impossible to independently determine how wealthy Mr. Trump is, since most of his assets are privately held real estate investments that lack the kind of unforgiving financial disclosure required of his publicly traded casino holdings. But a cursory examination of Mr. Trump's finances suggests that his claims of being a billionaire may be greatly exaggerated.
His casino holdings, as of about a week ago, were worth $34.5 million. That, however, was when Trump Hotels' stock was trading around $2 a share on the New York Stock Exchange. As of yesterday, the stock traded over the counter for 36 cents a share. Yesterday, Mr. Trump repeatedly said that his Trump Hotels stock represented only about 2 percent of his wealth; based on the prebankruptcy trading price of the shares, that would give him a net worth of about $1.7 billion -- well below the $4 billion to $5 billion figure he suggested earlier in the day.
But even $1.7 billion may be too generous an assessment of Mr. Trump's wealth. Although Mr. Trump now distances himself from his casino business, for most of his life in the public eye, casinos were a significant pillar of his wealth, with a substantial inheritance from his wealthy father and his real estate holdings making up the rest. But past flirtations with personal and corporate bankruptcy forced Mr. Trump to either sell some prized real estate holdings or cede control of what remained to outside investors, particularly a group of wealthy Chinese financiers. While Mr. Trump still owns some handsome properties, his overall real estate holdings have been greatly diminished.
Two people with direct knowledge of the matter said that in the midst of his earlier financial crisis Mr. Trump borrowed $20 million to $30 million from his father's $150 million estate to fend off creditors.
Mr. Trump disputed that yesterday, though he declined to provide a valuation of his father's estate. ''I had zero borrowings from the estate,'' he said. ''I give you my word.''
In one well-publicized incident at the time, Mr. Trump's father even walked into one of his Atlantic City casinos to buy chips in order to give his son's casinos some much needed cash.
''That was in 1990, OK?'' Mr. Trump said yesterday. ''That was a long time ago.''
Moreover, while most multibillionaires do not serve as hucksters in commercials for Visa and Verizon, Mr. Trump said his ubiquity on television was not only shrewd self-promotion -- it was lucrative.
''I get a lot of money from doing that, it's not little money,'' he said. ''Other rich people don't do commercials because no one asks them. It's just like 'The Apprentice.' I can't tell you how many of my rich friends are dying, dying to have me put them on that show.''
The Credit Suisse Group, a Wall Street investment bank leading the bankruptcy reorganization of Trump Hotels, will control the business if the revamping is completed. Credit Suisse offered to lend Mr. Trump the $55 million he needs to maintain a 25 percent ownership interest, according to an investment banker involved in the transaction. But Mr. Trump said he planned to provide the money himself. If he does not come up with the money, his equity stake in the company will largely evaporate.
''I'm not interested in a loan for this,'' Mr. Trump said. ''I'm doing it out of cash. You can check on this after the deal is done.''
The source of Mr. Trump's proposed $55 million investment has been an object of speculation among Trump Hotels bondholders and analysts. Jane Padreira, a fixed-income analyst who covers Trump Hotels for Lehman Brothers, was among several observers who think Mr. Trump will have to borrow the funds. ''I don't believe that he has that kind of money,'' she said.
To be sure, the reorganization of Trump Hotels makes financial sense. The company owns prime casino locations in a growth industry, and if the bankruptcy plan succeeds in reducing the company's debt burden, Trump Hotels will be able to finance an overhaul of its properties.
Whether Mr. Trump is along for the ride as an owner, rather than simply as a marketer, will be determined by that $55 million.
Even though the terms of the reorganization call for Mr. Trump to cede his chief executive post, Trump Hotels will pay him a $2 million salary to stay aboard as chairman and help promote the casinos.
''It's pretty amazing to still be paid with no executive capacity, after driving the company into bankruptcy,'' said Jeffrey A. Sonnenfeld, an associate dean at the Yale School of Management, a frequent critic of Mr. Trump. ''It is surprising that the bondholders didn't say, 'You're fired.' Instead, they said, 'You are fired but we are still paying you.'''
Not all Trump Hotels bondholders have agreed to the bankruptcy reorganization plan, and that may still derail the deal. In the meantime, Mr. Trump said he intended to dip into his personal assets and remain in the casino business.
''One reason I have a lot of cash is because I'm in the condo business,'' Mr. Trump said. ''I'm not bound to tell you how much cash I have, but I have a lot of cash and a lot of real estate.''
Like many people across New Jersey, Betty Williams, a 53-year-old homemaker from Cherry Hill, felt a mix of puzzlement and respect at first.
That was on Thursday, when Gov. James E. McGreevey resigned after announcing that he had had an extramarital affair with a man and that the consequences had compromised his ability to govern.
But as the news spread yesterday that Mr. McGreevey had installed the man in a high-ranking, high-paying state job for which he seemed ill-qualified, Ms. Williams's admiration curdled into disgust.
''He made this wonderful little speech that, if true, would have been a landmark of some sort,'' Ms. Williams, a registered Democrat, said yesterday between bites of sushi at the food court in the Cherry Hill Mall. ''But now that speech is just another political lie. He's now just another hack who gave someone a job who didn't deserve it.''
Yesterday, the other man in the affair, Golan Cipel, accused the governor in a statement of making repeated sexual advances on him, and said he faced retaliation when he rejected those advances. Mr. Cipel, an Israeli national, had been hired by the governor as an adviser on homeland security in 2002 and eventually drew a salary of $110,000 a year despite having little experience in the field.
Some people yesterday called Mr. McGreevey's news conference on Thursday courageous, but others, particularly those who had followed the matter closely, called it a cynical ploy to cloak political misdeeds in the issue of sexuality.
''He can say that it's because of him being gay,'' said Jake Stuiver, 30, a Democrat from Jersey City, ''but in fact he's being forced to resign because he's a corrupt governor. Now he has this sympathetic excuse.''
In Mr. McGreevey's hometown, Woodbridge, some residents said that the governor's sexuality was an open secret, and that the announcement was less a bombshell than an inevitable development.
''I knew he was a gay American long before he said it,'' said David Grumet, 63, outside the Reo Diner on Amboy Avenue. As for Mr. Cipel, Mr. Grumet said: ''He had absolutely no reason to appoint him to the position he was in. Now everything is finally coming down on McGreevey's shoulders and he has absolutely too much to bear and doesn't have a choice.''
Mr. McGreevey's announcement that he intended to stay in office until Nov. 15, allowing his fellow Democrats to appoint an acting governor for a year rather than holding a special election, proved to Mr. Grumet, a Republican who runs a wholesale cake business, that the move was far more political than personal.
''It's absolutely ludicrous,'' he said. ''Why shouldn't the people of New Jersey have the right to decide who the governor is going to be?''
Noah Lynch, 35, a financial analyst bowling away his lunch hour at the Woodbridge Bowling Center, said that he could forgive Mr. McGreevey a raw patronage hire. After all, he said, every politician makes them. But not for such a crucial post.
''There are a million state jobs, and there are jobs that were probably available that he was qualified for,'' Mr. Lynch said of Mr. Cipel.
''I don't care anything about a person's sexuality,'' Mr. Lynch added. ''I'd much rather have a gay governor who's in a permanent relationship than a straight person who's going to lie and steal. But he used state money to fund that affair, and that was dead wrong.''
Others, more sympathetic to the governor, stuck by him, more or less, saying that though he had done wrong, he did not need to step down.
At the Main Street Barber Shop, where Mr. McGreevey was a longtime customer, the owner, Michael Apito, said, ''The only mistake he made was not getting his hair cut here before the press conference.''
Jerome Reed, a waiting customer, said that Mr. McGreevey's decision struck him as ''partially noble and probably politically expedient.''
''The bottom line is that he sinned and he admitted his sin and he stood up,'' said Mr. Reed, 41, a small-business owner who lives in Piscataway. ''He didn't have to resign.''
Outside the Woodbridge Center Mall, Elsie Hutchings, 76, a retired secretary, said the whole situation made her sad. ''If he was having a boy toy on the side, that was his business,'' Ms. Hutchings said. ''He shouldn't have hired the guy, but he shouldn't have quit over it. He's been a great governor. I still think he's trying to do the best for people.''
A student once raised a teacher and partner from one no-trump to two no-trump and subsequently produced a nearly worthless dummy. The teacher was not entirely convinced by the explanation: ''Last week you told me that one no-trump is the most difficult contract to make.''
It is indeed true that one no-trump or any low part-score can be quite complicated if the high-card points are evenly divided and no eight-card fit is available. When the lead changes hands frequently, the declarer and the defenders have far more opportunities to err than they would in a game or a slam. An example is the diagramed deal, played in June at a Sectional in Clubsgame at the Water Mill Club in Southampton on Long Island.
It can be seen that each partnership had 20 points, and nobody had a fit. East-West were about to play in one no-trump when North ventured a double. South was not sure that one no-trump would be defeated, but he should have taken the risk of passing: The result would almost certainly have been down one, for a desirable penalty of 200. Almost any lead would have beaten the contract, including the heart king. Only the club ace, the heart ten and the heart eight would have permitted East to succeed.
But South chose to pull the double and was headed for trouble. He tried two diamonds, the unbid suit, and then two spades, with West eagerly doubling each contract.
Any lead except a trump was due to beat two spades doubled, and West's choice was the obvious heart queen. The defense became much harder when East erred by taking his ace. It was not likely that the queen was a singleton, and if it was, an immediate ruff was probably unnecessary: it would weaken West's four-card trump holding.
The declarer was Geoffrey O'Connor of Southampton, and he had to judge the position at the second trick when a heart was returned. Which mistake had East made? Playing the ace from A J x x x did not seem likely, so South put up his king, hoping that the jack would fall. And it did.
Next the declarer led to the diamond ace. West failed to unblock an honor, so he was endplayed by the next diamond lead. He could and did take a second diamond winner but was then on lead in this position:
Now there was only one defense, and West did not find it. He shifted to the club two, and the three, jack and ace were played. South finessed the club ten, cashed the king, and led to the heart ten.
West ruffed, and was endplayed for the second time. He led the last club, and South threw dummy's diamond and ruffed in his hand. The spade ten was led, and West was allowed to win with the jack. That was the third and final endplay: West had to lead from the spade king at the 12th trick, and O'Connor had made two spades doubled en route to a 64 percent game and a victory at his club.
The way for West to escape in the diagramed position was to lead the club queen, a good play that is usually missed.

ON a sultry summer Monday evening at the Red Rooster Drive-In there were newlyweds from Brooklyn on their honeymoon; a retiree from Manhattan in his blue Yale cap; a couple from Pawling, N.Y., who had just sent their daughter off to college; and a tile setter from Danbury, Conn.
There were parents and grandparents watching toddlers on kiddie rides or playing miniature golf. There was a veterinarian, a few financial industry types, a letter carrier, an engineer and two ice-cream-eating vizslas, or Hungarian pointers.
There was almost no one who planned to spend much time watching the grand political pageant going on 60 miles to the south.
The Red Rooster, an A-framed monument to American road food at its finest, with a red and white facade, a plaster vanilla cone on the roof, and imperial burgers, chili dogs and onion rings, will not replace Nobu, Daniel and Per Se as a Republican convention dining hot ticket. But it's a reminder that if there are Two Americas, as John Edwards says, one dividing line could be the one that separates the Media-Political-Industrial Complex, for whom a national political convention is just about the swellest event there ever could be, from average people for whom it's something less than must-see TV.
It's not that the people sitting at metal picnic tables or slurping down shakes in minivans and campers weren't interested in presidential politics. Almost all of them were. But few saw the staged, prepackaged hoopla of the conventions in New York and Boston as a useful forum for mass enlightenment.
So Sue Siciliano of Carmel, N.Y., and her sister, Deb Minasi of New Milford, Conn., won't be watching much, if any of it. "Four days for what?" Ms. Siciliano said. "Are they going to say anything we haven't heard already? I doubt it."
Adam Manes, a financial manager from South Kent, Conn., didn't watch the Democrats and won't be watching the Republicans either.
"I have a limited amount of time to pay attention to politics," he said. "The debates I'll watch. I don't think you learn very much by watching a political convention."
Same with Jamer Breene, a bond salesman from Bedford, N.Y., who said he was reading "An Unfinished Life: John F. Kennedy, 1917-1963," which reminded him that conventions once meant something in a way they do not now.
"I think I know what they're going to say, and I'm not very interested in listening to George Bush now," he said. "I don't think there's much reason for conventions anymore. It's not like they pick the candidates there. It's all planned. There are no surprises. A friend said he's very glad the U.S. Open is on, so he won't feel any obligation to watch."
Bob Landau, who drove down from South Egremont, Mass., with his wife, Carole, to meet up with his son and daughter-in-law and their four children, who drove up from White Plains, was more interested in tuning in to his grandchildren.
"We're already anesthetized," he said. "If you know what they're going to say and how they're going to say it, it's just an exercise in redundancy to watch it. If you watch three minutes each day on the 11 o'clock news, you get what you need. Why watch four nights for 12 minutes of information?"
The crowd did lean Blue State left, though most of the people who weren't going to watch the Republicans hadn't watched the Democrats either. And almost everyone was savvy enough to know that whether or not they watched the convention, they were all picking up its messages by media osmosis. So Doug Palmer, who owns his tile company, said he considered himself a news freak, but would learn about the proceedings mostly from WCBS-AM (880) and CNN.
That might not provide the whole story. Who knew that patriotic Republicans see wartime Purple Hearts as hilarious gag items worth mocking? But for most it will have to do.
Still, there were a few exceptions who said they would tune in regularly.
Pete Vigliotti of Brewster said he is a Republican and was eager to watch former Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani and a good bit of the rest of the convention.
And the newlyweds, ardent Kerry voters, Erica Rosenfeld, a glass blower, and Alex Stimmel, a musician, showing great promise for a long, happy life together, said they planned to watch on their honeymoon.
"We both like screaming at the television set," Mr. Stimmel said.

Bridge insomniacs of the world unite: you can play at 5:30 a.m. if you wish.
South on the diagramed deal played last month was Sergei Kustarov of St. Petersburg, Russia, who in more reasonable hours coaches the Russian national team. His partner was Henri Schweitzer, playing in Montpellier, France, at 3.30 a.m. Both are experts who commentate on Vugraph presentations for BridgeBase Online, the free service provided by Fred Gitelman. They were using this network opposing Jack Greenberg and Joel Goren, playing in New York City at the civilized hour of 9:30 p.m.
A Michaels cue-bid by West, showing spades and a minor, pushed North-South to five hearts. Four spades was as high as East-West could afford. Five spades would have been doubled and defeated by three tricks for a penalty of 500 after the normal lead of a top club. (East would save a trick after a heart lead.)
A spade was led against five hearts, and dummy's jack was covered by the ace and ruffed in the closed hand. He led to the heart ace, and proceeded to ruff in his hand as often as possible. He began with a spade ruff, a club to dummy's jack and a third spade ruff. He then cashed the club ace, led to dummy's queen and ruffed the last spade with his last trump. He was then able to throw dummy's diamond on the club king, and make his contract. East scored the king-jack of hearts, but that was all.
Not bad at 5:30 a.m. South would have been more severely tested by a nonspade lead. In that case he would have had to resist the temptation to cash the heart ace.

CHICAGO, Sept. 8 - Five months after he catapulted to celebrity status by winning a job on Donald Trump's staff, Bill Rancic insists he is spending more time learning about ventilation systems than dating celebrities.
After Mr. Rancic won his job on the television reality show "The Apprentice," he was given what Mr. Trump called a top position overseeing construction of a new hotel-and-condominium complex in Chicago. Since then, he has appeared on television talk shows, been the subject of breathless magazine profiles and become a fixture in gossip columns. Work at the site where his skyscraper is to rise, however, has not yet begun.
"The Apprentice" became a pop-culture phenomenon last season, drawing more than 20 million viewers each week. With the show's second season to begin on Thursday, Mr. Rancic's experience may offer clues about what the next winner can expect.
By his own account, he is learning more about the Trump way of doing business than about construction engineering.
"I'm not going to tell anyone I know how to build a 90-story skyscraper, because I don't," Mr. Rancic said. "I'm learning about the different phases of development. Donald is taking me through it step by step. He's showing me that even at the highest level of business, relationships, sales and marketing are what count. Great marketing, that's what it's all about."
With his faith in the power of imagery and the pleasure he evidently takes from his newfound status, Mr. Rancic, 33, may be on his way to becoming a younger version of Mr. Trump. In the rush of publicity that followed his television triumph in April, he dated the winner of another reality show, "The Bachelorette," led a crowd at Wrigley Field in singing "Take Me Out to the Ball Game" and published a book of advice for entrepreneurs that includes maxims like "know who you are" and "make your vocation your vacation."
Although Mr. Rancic won a job as "president" of the skyscraper project, he is still far from being its most important planner. "The guys are taking me through it step by step, showing me how a building like this goes up," he said.
This month, Mr. Trump completed his $73 million purchase of the riverside site where the skyscraper will rise. More than half of the 460 condominiums have already been sold. Demolition of the unloved Chicago Sun-Times building, which occupies the site, is scheduled to begin in October.
Laying the foundation is expected to take at least 10 months. By then, Mr. Rancic's one-year, $250,000 job is supposed to have ended.
"The goal of this thing is not to become a 20-year employee of the Trump organization," Mr. Rancic said. "It's to learn what you can and then move on. But the door is open. I may stick around longer than one year."
Mr. Trump said he was open to that possibility. Asked if his new apprentice had made any important decisions, though, he replied, "Not up to this point."
"Bill is a very talented guy, but don't forget, he is an apprentice," Mr. Trump said. "He's working a little bit in sales, a little bit as an owner's representative, and a lot in learning how to build a building from people who have done a tremendous job for me in the past. He'll be a coordinator, a jack of all trades."
Mr. Trump said he had not been put off by Mr. Rancic's emergence as a celebrity.
"I actually encourage it," he said. "Fame is a positive if it's utilized properly. It's good for Bill and good for the project."
Real estate developers in Chicago are keeping a discreet eye on Mr. Rancic. One of them, Steven Fifield, who has built dozens of buildings here and elsewhere, said Mr. Rancic could be successful if he recognized his limits.
"He's a good guy with a good people sense who is a team leader," Mr. Fifield said. "He coordinates the experts without trying to tell them how to do their job, which would be ridiculous."
"Trump's staff in New York is giving him overarching support, of course," Mr. Fifield said. "He's like a rookie quarterback who comes to a team with a great front line, a great coach and great assistant coaches. The project is already designed, largely bid out and costed out. If this guy sticks to what he can handle, as I think he will, he'll do fine."
Mr. Rancic is spending most of his time in Chicago, but commutes to New York for what he called "learning sessions" with construction engineers and others.
"A lot of people, myself included, thought that after I won the thing, I was never going to see Donald Trump again," he said. "That hasn't been the case. I see him and talk to him whenever I want."
Reports about his wild new life, Mr. Rancic said, are much exaggerated. "I wish I could tell you that's what's going on, but I haven't been out on a date for a long time," he said. "I've had the chance to do a couple of cool things. But spending all my time gallivanting with models, no. If you know any, though, you can send them my way."
Correction: September 14, 2004, Tuesday An article on Friday about Bill Rancic, who won a job with Donald Trump on the television show "The Apprentice," referred imprecisely to the Chicago hotel and condominium project on which Mr. Rancic is working. Mr. Trump has signed a $73 million agreement to buy Hollinger International's stake in the project along with its site, now occupied by a Hollinger property, The Chicago Sun-Times. The purchase is not complete; Mr. Trump is to pay the balance on the departure of The Sun-Times, expected next month.

JACK AND BOBBY -- A quirky, time-traveling drama that traces the coming of age of two brothers, one of whom is destined to be the president of the United States -- but it's not a historical series. These are not the Kennedy brothers, though the connection is far from unintentional. The boys, Jack the born leader and Bobby the introspective misfit, are being raised in a small Missouri town by a dynamic single mother who is a college professor (Christine Lahti). In flash-forwards 40 years ahead, we see the impact of events in their youths. The boys are played by the newcomers Matthew Long and Logan Lerman. WB, Sundays at 9 starting tonight. A related article is on Page 80.
A SEPARATE PEACE -- A new film version of the classic John Knowles novel set in an elite boys' school during World War II. Hume Cronyn gives his last performance. Showtime, tonight at 7:30.
THE BENEFACTOR -- First in what will probably be a long list of descendants of "The Apprentice," this reality series features Mark Cuban, the eccentric owner of the Dallas Mavericks basketball team, leading a pack of would-be moguls through adventures in which he dispenses advice and money. ABC, Mondays at 8 starting tomorrow.
LAX -- How much drama really happens at an airport? NBC thinks it's enough to build an entire series around, which most likely means a lot of security threats, as well as missing children and drug smuggling. The idea is to make the airport locale as exotic as that of the show it follows, last year's surprise hit "Las Vegas," though there are limited opportunities for showgirls to appear in the airport lounge. Two familiar television faces, Heather Locklear and Blair Underwood, play rival security officers. NBC, Mondays at 10 starting tomorrow.
RATED R: REPUBLICANS IN HOLLYWOOD -- How do confirmed conservatives function in the liberal stronghold of show business? That question is examined in this documentary by a former Democratic speechwriter, Jesse Moss. He produces a number of outspoken right-wing entertainers, including Patricia Heaton of "Everybody Loves Raymond," the comic Drew Carey and, of all things, a game-show host, Pat Sajak. AMC, Tuesday at 10.
WEDDING VIDEOS REVEALED -- A collection of horrible moments from people's wedding videos -- all in good fun, of course. Lifetime, Thursday at 11.
COMMANDO NANNY -- As if Mark Burnett doesn't already have enough success as the producer of "Survivor" and "The Apprentice," now he has a sitcom about his early life as a former British special forces soldier who becomes a nanny for three spoiled kids in Beverly Hills. If it ever gets on the air, that is: first Owain Yeoman replaced Philip Winchester, who broke his foot just before the series began filming, in the title role; then production was delayed again two weeks ago when Gerald McRaney, who plays the nanny's boss, underwent lung surgery. Originally scheduled for Fridays at 8:30 starting this week on WB; now on hold.
FAMILY BONDS -- A reality series, HBO style. A big, boisterous Long Island family, the Evangelistas, work together as bounty hunters, tracking down bail jumpers with a brutal bluntness matched only by their conversations with one another. And all of it is on camera. HBO, Sundays at 10 starting next Sunday.
THE WIRE -- A new season of one of the most challenging -- and rewarding, for the dedicated -- dramas on television. Once again flawed cops trace the underground drug economy of Baltimore, with political machinations stirring in the background. Most of the cast, led by Dominic West, returns. HBO, Sundays at 9 starting next Sunday.
SECOND TIME AROUND -- A young couple are enjoying newly married life -- several years after their divorce. A real-life couple, on their first marriage, play the pair: Nicole Parker and Boris Kodjoe, both alumni of the series "Soul Food." UPN, Mondays at 9:30 starting Sept. 20.
LISTEN UP -- The sportswriter Tony Kornheiser's life is funny enough, apparently, to inspire a sitcom -- if "inspire" is a word that can be used for this show. Jason Alexander comes back to television comedy to play Mr. Kornheiser (here named Tony Kleinman), who is also known for his appearances on ESPN arguing with his Washington Post colleague Michael Wilbon (here named Bernie Widmer and played by Malcolm-Jamal Warner). Much of the show is about family life and raising daughters. CBS, Mondays at 8:30 starting Sept. 20.
RODNEY -- ABC, which specializes in blue-collar comedy, offers up Rodney Carrington, a stand-up comedian, playing a regular guy who keeps getting fired from jobs while he's trying to be a stand-up comedian. His humor runs toward walking into department stores naked. The show also stars Amy Pietz ("Caroline in the City") as his wife. ABC, Tuesdays at 9:30 starting Sept. 21.
LOST -- One of the few groundbreaking new series, a drama written by the creator of "Alias," J. J. Abrams, and set on an island where a plane crash has left a group of survivors facing unusual hardships. ABC, Wednesdays at 8 starting Sept. 22. A related article is on Page 80.
VERONICA MARS -- A 17-year-old girl turns out to be a crackerjack detective in this well-thought-of drama series, in which she ferrets out the dirty secrets of an affluent oceanside community. It stars Kristen Bell, who made a searing impression as a young hustler who came to a brutal end in HBO's "Deadwood" this season. UPN, Tuesdays at 9 after a Sept. 22 premiere.
C.S.I. NEW YORK -- The most anticipated new series of the year and the most likely to be a hit, reflecting the success of the two "C.S.I." shows that preceded it. And the franchise's creator, Anthony Zuiker, will be at the helm. The graphically depicted action shifts to the forensic unit of the N.Y.P.D.; the impressive cast is led by the busy film actor Gary Sinise and Melina Kanakaredes ("Providence"). CBS, Wednesdays at 10 starting Sept. 22.
COMPLETE SAVAGES -- The chaotic life of a father raising five sons alone, with all the crude activity that implies. The Savage family can't keep a decent housekeeper, because no one wants to contend with such a loutish bunch; of course, they're a sweetly loving brood at heart. From Mike Scully of "Simpsons" fame. Keith Carradine plays the patriarch. ABC, Fridays at 8:30 starting Sept. 24.
DR. VEGAS -- The city that seems to have enough drama for an endless number of TV series now spawns a show that mixes medicine and poker chips. Rob Lowe plays the house doctor at a hotel and casino, whose cases reflect the city's most outré behavior. With Joe Pantoliano ("The Sopranos") as the hotel manager. CBS, Fridays at 10 starting Sept. 24.
CLUBHOUSE -- The adventures of a boy living out his dream of being a batboy for the New York Empires, a team closely modeled on the Yankees. How many stories this premise can yield is probably as big a question as who will start in the playoffs for the real Yankees. It stars the newcomer Jeremy Sumpter, with the class act Mare Winningham as his mom and Dean Cain ("Lois and Clark") as a star player he idolizes. CBS, Tuesdays at 9 after a premiere Sept. 26 at 8.
THE WORST WEEK OF MY LIFE -- A seven-part comedy about the endless indignities suffered by a couple (Sarah Alexander and Ben Miller) heading for their wedding day. Each episode covers a single day in the growing chaos. BBC America, Sundays at 9 starting Sept. 26.
McCALLUM -- A murder mystery as only the British do them, with John Hannah playing a forensic pathologist in London who favors motorcycles and demanding women. BBC America, Mondays at 9 starting Sept. 27.
CENTER OF THE UNIVERSE -- A new sitcom vehicle for the often-employed John Goodman, here playing the steady guy at the center of an aggressively wacky family, which includes a father (Ed Asner) obsessed with sex and a mother (Olympia Dukakis) too loopy to notice. CBS, Wednesdays at 9:30 starting Sept. 29.
KEVIN HILL -- One of the biggest shocks of the season: perhaps the most talked-about, and best, new series is on the once-marginal network UPN. UPN, Wednesdays at 9 starting Sept. 29. A related article is on Page 80.
WIFE SWAP -- Once destined to be a much-talked-about new series, now relegated to spouse-swap-come-lately status, thanks to Fox's getting its "Trading Spouses" onto the air first this summer. This is still a highly produced example of social study as reality show, with two women of differing backgrounds exchanging lives for 10 days. ABC, Wednesdays at 10 starting Sept. 29.
October
BOSTON LEGAL -- It's not the same old "Practice" anymore, though some of the crew are the same. David E. Kelley has totally remade his legal series from drama to comedy, more akin to "Ally McBeal." But he continues to have the invaluable asset of James Spader as the incomparably weird Alan Shore. ABC, Sundays at 10 starting Oct. 3.
COLD TURKEY -- All reality shows have an element of cruelty to them; this one wears it on its sleeve. A group of unsuspecting chain smokers think they are being recruited for a typically silly reality series, only to find they are in a contest to quit cigarettes in pursuit of a cash prize. Sequestered in a house, they must endure the throes of withdrawal to outlast their competitors. Comedy and torture combined -- a sure ratings draw. PAX, Sundays at 10 starting Oct. 3.
DESPERATE HOUSEWIVES -- Beyond the catchy title, there are elements herein of the classic soap. In a wealthy suburb, one of the wives commits suicide. Nobody knows why, but as the women in the community start to talk, more and more dirty little secrets spill out. A feast for all lovers of dirty little secrets. Among the stars: Teri Hatcher ("Lois and Clark") and Felicity Huffman ("Sports Night"). ABC, Sundays at 9 starting Oct. 3.
AND YOU DON'T STOP: 30 YEARS OF HIP-HOP -- A comprehensive history of a musical and cultural movement that has had worldwide impact. The five-part documentary series, produced by Russell Simmons, will include interviews with a wide range of stars including Eminem, Snoop Dogg, OutKast, Ice-T, Kid Rock and the Beastie Boys. VH1, Oct. 4 to Oct. 8 at 10.
RFK -- A documentary from the filmmaker David Grubin that looks at the life of the doomed younger Kennedy brother; the first hour is devoted to his days as the ferocious aide-de-camp of his big brother Jack, the second to the wounded, suddenly empathetic man of the little people, who would also be cut down in his prime. A long list of historians and journalists contribute commentary to this "American Experience" installment. PBS, Oct. 4 at 9.
TANNER ON TANNER -- The creative team behind the fondly remembered 1988 HBO series "Tanner '88," Robert Altman and Garry Trudeau, bring back many of the same characters for an update on the increasingly loony world of American politics. Among the many big names participating in this mini-series: Robert Redford, Martin Scorsese, Madeleine Albright and Mario Cuomo. Sundance, Tuesdays at 9 starting Oct. 5.
PROOF POSITIVE: EVIDENCE OF THE PARANORMAL -- A weekly battle between the true believers of science fiction and those who insist on little things like facts. Each week, three tales of seemingly extranormal phenomena (ghosts and aliens will be frequent participants) will be tested by teams of scientists to see which tale is real. Sci-Fi, Wednesdays at 8 starting Oct. 6.
GHOST HUNTERS -- Real-life ghostbusters investigate alleged haunted houses around the country. The group, called the Atlantic Paranormal Society, is made up of ordinary souls -- plumbers, teachers, factory workers -- all trying to solve unexplained disturbances. Produced by the team that does the hit "American Chopper" series. Sci-Fi, Wednesdays at 9 starting Oct. 6.
LIFE AS WE KNOW IT -- Teenage boys and their raging hormones. The series, which seems like the flip side of "My So-Called Life" -- and some of the same people are involved -- tries to capture what it's like to be a boy in high school thinking about sex at virtually every moment. The cast includes new names like Sean Faris, Jon Foster and Chris Lowell. ABC, Thursdays at 9 starting Oct. 7.
DIARY OF A POLITICAL TOURIST -- Alexandra Pelosi ("Journeys With George") makes another film for a presidential year, this time looking at the field of Democratic contenders over the two years they chased the nomination. HBO, Oct. 11 at 8.
I HATE MY JOB -- Surely one of the most original ideas of the year for a reality show: eight guys quit their jobs and are given three months to chase the job they have always wanted. Of course, bringing along a camera crew might help. In some highly original casting, the Rev. Al Sharpton will serve as the host, a kind of career counselor and motivational coach. Spike, Tuesdays at 9 starting Oct. 12.
THE CLUB -- Another fresh take on the reality genre. The producer Ben Silverman, who has taken behind-the-scenes looks at the creation of a restaurant and a beauty salon, here offers Ice, a Las Vegas nightclub undergoing a complete makeover in order to compete with the big hotels on the Strip. Spike, Tuesdays at 10 starting Oct. 12.
MANHUNT: THE SEARCH FOR AMERICA'S MOST GORGEOUS MALE MODEL -- Well, why not? There's already a female model show, and it's a hit. In this one, men will be plucked from the street (literally) and put through their paces. The winner gets a contract from the IMG agency. Bravo, Tuesdays at 10 starting Oct. 12.
THE LOST PRINCE -- The story of an obscure member of the British royal family, Prince John, uncle of the current Queen Elizabeth, who was hidden from society because he had epilepsy and learning disabilities. From his sequestered isolation the prince observes the world of the 19th century melting away during the cataclysm of World War I. Written and directed by Stephen Poliakoff ("Perfect Strangers"); the cast includes a host of well-known British actors, among them Miranda Richardson, Michael Gambon and Bill Nighy. A two-part "Masterpiece Theater." PBS, Sundays at 9, Oct. 17 and 24.
THE OFFICE SPECIAL -- One more chance to see the incomparable cast of characters that made the British comedy "The Office" a true water-cooler show. The special picks up where the series left off, with David Brent (Ricky Gervais) begging to stay employed. (An American version of the series has been made by NBC and is expected to be on the air by next summer.) BBC America, Oct. 21 at 9.
AMNESIA -- John Hannah plays yet another detective, this one a bit less the hero, in a psychological thriller. His Inspector Stone is trying to solve the disappearance of his wife on their fifth anniversary, but another missing-person case, which involves a suspect possibly faking amnesia, complicates matters. BBC America, Oct. 25 at 8.
DRAWN TOGETHER -- Billed as the first animated "reality" series, the show features a cast of cartoon characters of differing styles who are thrown together in the same cartoon house, where their interactions become a cartoon adventure. Comedy Central, Wednesdays at 10:30 starting Oct. 27.
LONG WAY ROUND -- The adventures of the actor Ewan McGregor and his pal Charley Boorman as they basically circumnavigate the globe on motorcycles. They traverse nearly impossible terrain equipped with hand-held cameras to document their efforts. Bravo, Thursdays at 10 starting Oct. 28.
PEEP SHOW -- Cringe inducing, but deliberately so; comedy as only the British can do it. Two young losers' thoughts are audible, and excruciatingly embarrassing. BBC America, Thursdays at 9:30 starting Oct. 28.
November
THE YOUNG VISITERS -- An adaptation of a much-loved Victorian novel written (and misspelled) by a 9-year-old-girl, Daisy Ashford. Two men compete for the attentions of a sweet young lady. Jim Broadbent stars. BBC America, Nov. 3 at 8.
HENRY VIII -- Yet another look at the infamous monarch, this one made distinctive by an extraordinary cast headed by Ray Winstone ("Sexy Beast") as the king and Helena Bonham Carter as Anne Boleyn. Another "Masterpiece Theater" entry. PBS, Sundays at 9, Nov. 7 and 14.
HUFF -- A drama series centering on a troubled psychiatrist named Craig Huffstodt. After the suicide of a patient, for which he partly blames himself, Huff re-examines all aspects of his life, his family and his career. Hank Azaria stars, with Blythe Danner as his mother. Showtime, Sundays at 10 starting Nov. 7.
THE PARTNER -- A competitive reality show in which lawyers seek a job as partner in a top firm. Two teams, one from "elite" schools and the other a bunch of "street-smart" types, compete in mock court cases that eliminate the losers. Fox, Sundays at 9 starting Nov. 7.
THEY MADE AMERICA -- Based on the book by Sir Harold Evans, the three-part series explores American innovations, ranging from jet engines to rap music to brassieres. PBS, Mondays at 9 starting Nov. 8.
THE BILLIONAIRE -- That would be Sir Richard Branson, the British tycoon of Virgin fame. In another spin on "The Apprentice," he takes a group of would-be entrepreneurs on a trip around the world, dumping the losers as he goes. The format leans heavily toward the Donald Trump hit as the contestants face business challenges geared to test their mettle -- and succeed or fail on whether they impress Sir Richard. Fox, Tuesdays at 8 starting Nov. 9.
HOUSE -- More medical drama, more unexplained mysteries, another show much like others. This one focuses on an individual doctor, played by Hugh Laurie, who is part curmudgeon and all genius. His faithful team would follow him anywhere. Fox, Tuesdays at 9 starting Nov. 16.
THE CONTENDER -- Two months after Fox stole a march on NBC with its boxing series ("The Next Great Champ"), more snarling between the two networks is guaranteed as this offering goes head to head with the Branson show. It has an impressive pedigree, with the reality guru Mark Burnett, the DreamWorks mogul Jeffrey Katzenberg, Sylvester Stallone and Sugar Ray Leonard overseeing a boxing tournament that incorporates the personal stories of the competitors. NBC, Tuesdays at 8 starting in November.
December
PROJECT RUNWAY -- Another reality competition, this time among would-be fashion designers. They get their chance to design their way to fame and fortune, with a panel of judges from the industry, led by the model Heidi Klum, deciding their fate. Bravo, Wednesdays at 10 starting Dec. 1.
THE NEW SEASON/TELEVISION Correction: September 26, 2004, Sunday An annotated film listing in the New Season issue on Sept. 12 for "The Final Cut," to be released on Oct. 15, included a performer erroneously. Anjelica Huston is not in the film.
An annotated pop music listing for the album "Real Gone" by Tom Waits, to be released on Oct. 5, misidentified the first album by Mr. Waits on which the guitarist Marc Ribot played. It was "Rain Dogs," not "Swordfishtrombones."
An annotated television listing for the cable program "Kitchen Accomplished" misstated the name of the carrier. It is the Food Network, not Food Channel.
One morning in July, Donald J. Trump walked across the vast, peach-colored marble lobby of Trump Tower toward his fans, who had formed into two orderly lines stretching from the skyscraper's doors to Trump's black limo, idling at the curb. "I don't think this happened to Bill Zeckendorf," he cracked. Zeckendorf, a very successful real-estate developer, was the closest thing to Donald Trump a generation ago -- which is to say, not close at all. We plunged outside, and the fans, observing a correct distance, thrust out copies of Trump's latest, mega-best-selling book, "Trump: How to Get Rich."
"Will you sign my book, Mr. Trump?" He signed.
"Hey, Donald, if I send the book to your office, will you sign and send it back?" Yeah, sure, he said. Send it in.
Trump worked the crowd in his own peculiar way. He abhors physical contact, so he raised his arms, like a heavyweight champion, and paraded around the circle left by his fans' respectful regard. "Does everybody watch 'The Apprentice'?" he shouted. That was a joke; they loved the show.
William Zeckendorf was merely a famous developer; Trump has transcended such petty categories to become the most famous businessman since . . . well, forever, as he says himself. His name has become such a byword for success that even the most humiliating reverses barely dent his reputation. Reports had it that he would be forced to place the company that holds his Atlantic City hotel and casino operation into bankruptcy, and in fact he did just that a few weeks later. He would have to come up with $55million in cash to preserve his stake in the company. Did he have $55 million? Only an idiot would even ask! Of course he did! He had huge cash flow from his real-estate operations. He was stronger than ever. He could have rescued the company with a check if he'd wanted to, but he would rather do it "institutionally," with an infusion of capital from his good friends at Credit Suisse First Boston -- his bank, by the way.
The rules that govern others just don't apply to Trump. With him, it's celebrity that breeds success rather than the other way around. And Trump has never been a bigger celebrity than he is now, thanks to the astounding success of "The Apprentice," which has been nominated for four Emmys and began its second season last week. Did I think that crowd on the sidewalk was big? That was nothing! The fans just hadn't had time to gather. Once inside the arctic cool of the limo -- we were going to the topping-off ceremony for the 6th of the projected 19 buildings in a development known as Trump Place -- Trump told me that if the car sits at the curb for 10 minutes before he arrives, he has to fight his way through a thousand people. "Half an hour," he continued, "you have to close off the street."
Like it or not, Donald Trump is now the No. 1 guy in the world's No. 1 city. With Rudy Giuliani off making money and the rather colorless Mike Bloomberg occupying City Hall, Trump has become the emblematic New Yorker. And this bears some thought, for the New York that Trump incarnates is not the same one that Giuliani did, or Reggie Jackson, or Travis Bickle. Remember the City of Unshakable Resolve that rose from the ashes of 9/11? That's history, baby, whatever the Republicans were saying two weeks ago. Trump's New York is a Darwinian, winner-take-all town -- "the real jungle," as Trump crows in his show's opening moments, as opposed to those two-bit jungles featured on shows like "Survivor." Actual New Yorkers may have trouble recognizing themselves in the Trumpian narrative. But the fact that millions of Americans have become besotted with both the man and his show tells us that the Donald is on to something -- as it seems he always is. One generally accurate gauge of the greatness of the great man -- or woman -- is the number of supernumeraries and factotums whose hands you must pass through before gaining admission to the Presence. With this rule in mind, early in July I telephoned Howard Rubenstein, the publicist renowned for taking special care of the great, and asked what I needed to do to gain access to Trump. Rubenstein said, "Just call Norma in his office." Trump probably receives more requests for interviews than any other private citizen in New York, but he doesn't employ anyone to keep reporters from his door for the simple reason that he doesn't want to keep them from his door. I called Norma Foerderer, an effervescent former diplomat who has worked for Trump for a quarter of a century and now functions as his gatekeeper and gal Friday, and within a couple of days I found myself sitting across from Trump in his office on the 26th floor of Trump Tower.
One of the remarkable things about Trump, at least from a reporter's point of view, is that he does not require an actual interview; he just starts talking. That morning, without even bothering to stand up and shake my hand -- he believes shaking hands is a reckless invitation to infectious disease -- Trump started in on the widespread misconception that he does not own most of the properties on which he has affixed his name. He treats this as a malicious slur, since it makes him out to be a wizard of self-promotion rather than the biggest developer in New York, which is how he describes himself on "The Apprentice." "I've got 50 percent of the equity on Trump Place," he said, referring to the giant Hudson River development, "and that's 10 million square feet all by itself. Nobody's got 10 million square feet." I asked Trump if he could supply some documentary evidence of his half ownership. No problem, he said, unless his highly secretive Chinese partners objected.
By the way, had I heard about his new radio show? No, I hadn't. Trump had been contacted by both Clear Channel Communications and Infinity Broadcasting, the two big station-owning groups, to do radio. He had decided to go with Clear Channel, the industry monster, and they agreed to let him do a 90-second spot, the way Paul Harvey used to, and he started on June 14, his 58th birthday, and the response had been incredible, and "You want me to call Sean?" Sean Compton is the vice president for programming at Clear Channel Radio, which owns 1,200 stations. "Rhona!" he shouted. "Could you get Sean on the phone?" Trump put the phone on speaker. "Sean, I have a reporter here from The New York Times Magazine. You told me that my show was the biggest launch in radio history, is that right?"
"That's right, Donald."
"Bigger than Rush Limbaugh, right?"
"Rush rolled out with, I think, 60 stations. We rolled your show out with 320."
Trump invited me to interview Sean, while he delicately clipped his nails and swept the parings into his hand. Sean hazarded that "Trumped!" would soon be the biggest feature on radio. "Thanks, Sean," Trump said and bipped him off.
Trump loves the radio show because he gets to sound off on things like the idiotic names with which celebrities saddle their children or the repellent snobbery of the "Jag-u-ar" ad, all without leaving his desk. But radio is only one piece of a burgeoning empire. Since "The Apprentice," Trump has ascended into the Brandosphere, where an individual life becomes so immense, and so immensely desirable, that it can be marketed in the form of a purchasable lifestyle. This is the Olympus of the celebrity culture; its chief deities are Oprah, Martha (for now), Ralph Lauren and maybe P. Diddy. Now comes the Donald, with his own hit TV show, his own golf courses, his own magazine -- Trump World, whose first issue just arrived on the newsstands -- and his name-bearing collection of shirts, ties, suits and a fragrance. The suits and the fragrance are a done deal, and on the others he's just got to say the word.
In fact, when I was ushered into his office one morning a few weeks after our first meeting, Trump was surrounded by members of the Brody family, who apparently are huge in the suit business. They were showing him samples from the Donald J. Trump Signature Collection. The suits will retail for no more than $675. "The target is young men going into the business world for the first time," explained Sheldon Brody, the paterfamilias. For this demographic, thanks to "The Apprentice," the name "Trump" had apparently become synonymous with "business." Brody said that within 18 months he expected to be doing $60 million to $70 million worth of business "in stores all over America and the world." He invited Trump to admire the engraved golden blazer buttons. Trump said, "My manager at Bedminster" -- one of the golf courses -- "wants to buy every member a green blazer. What's it going to cost me if I buy, say, a thousand?" Ninety to a hundred dollars per, Sheldon figured. Trump nodded; he could have his very own version of the fabled green jacket at Augusta National for a hundred thousand bucks. Then he said, "You heard about my new radio show?" He started telling the Brody family, and me, the whole story -- Clear Channel, Paul Harvey, 90 seconds. Only when he turned to me and said, "You want me to call Sean?" did I gently remind him that Sean and I had spoken two weeks earlier. He called anyway, for the Brodys' benefit, and the family members stood frozen in respectful attention while Sean ran through the numbers. Trump's meteoric rise from mere superstar to brand name is a testament to the power of television. In his earlier heyday, in the late 1980's, when he was snapping up trophy properties like the Plaza Hotel, the Eastern Shuttle and Adnan Khashoggi's yacht and very publicly dumping wife No. 1, Ivana, for wife No. 2, Marla, Trump became famous through the medium of publicity and autobiographical literature. ("Trump: The Art of the Deal," which was published in 1987, sold 835,000 copies in hardcover alone, thanks in no small part to Trump's brief "presidential campaign" that year.) But "The Apprentice" introduced Trump to a vastly larger audience. More than 40 million people watched the first season's last episode (well, technically, some part of the last episode), when Trump anointed the winner. The show was the top-rated new series and tied with "The West Wing" for attracting TV's most affluent prime-time demographic. "The Apprentice" almost single-handedly rescued the lagging fortunes of NBC, the network that broadcast it.
Trump professes to be amazed by his blockbuster success. One afternoon, as we were standing on the steps of the Trump International Hotel and Tower at Columbus Circle, he said, apropos of I don't know what: "Harvey Weinstein calls -- he's a friend of mine; you know, he's the head of Miramax -- and he says, 'Donald, you know you're the biggest star in Hollywood.' I say, 'What are you talking about?' He says, 'You're the No. 1 star; you're a superstar on the No. 1 show in television [No. 4, actually]. You saved NBC.' I never thought of it, because the rest of the time I'm negotiating with contractors. So I said: 'You know what? It's true."'
Maybe it's only true in the poetic sense -- the sense in which Trump is the biggest developer in New York or in which Trump National at Briarcliff Manor is the best golf course in New York State. But why cavil? "The Apprentice" is huge, to use one of Trump's favorite words. It's also dopey, but it's dopey in a very powerful way. Most of the weekly "business" tasks designed to winnow out the contestants -- selling lemonade, charming bargains out of shopkeepers -- could be won by hiking up your skirt, which is why the girls beat the boys every week. But what made the show powerful was that these labors were understood to constitute a billionaire's boot camp. The contestants were all the kind of junior-beaver business aspirants who might be customers for the Trump Signature Collection. For them, business was the ultimate thrill ride, and Mr. Trump the ultimate businessman.
In the first episode, Sam, a slightly unhinged co-founder of an Internet media company, ardently declared, "I want access to Trump" -- and not on a game show but "in the back of a limo." The show brilliantly exploited the premise that access to Trump was an unsurpassably precious good. "As the master," Trump himself solemnly announced, "I want to pass along my knowledge to someone else."
Trump is god of "The Apprentice," its fate, its hero. And yet he often presides over this battle to the death with the leering malevolence of a Bond villain. He goes about either by black limo or black chopper, and he usually emerges from these war chariots with an ominous cuing of the strings. He materializes at the beginning of each episode to issue his entrepreneurial labor of Hercules. Then he often disappears until the very end, when he receives the contestants in a dark boardroom crossed with menacing shadows. And at the end of each episode, he administers the famous Blofeldian order of execution: "You're fired!" The only thing missing is the trap door into the shark pool (though one contestant did shout, "Don't say it, Mr. Trump!").
And yet Trump is, without question, the show's hero. Perhaps he suits the truculent national mood. As Mark Burnett, the show's creator and (with Trump) co-owner, says, "Americans want to puff out their chests right now. It's like a forget-about-you moment" -- Burnett actually used a more potent expression -- "and he's one of us." That's really the great revelation of "The Apprentice." Donald Trump is an egomaniacal, germophobic multi-multi-millionaire, and yet television viewers, and the folks who gather outside Trump Tower hoping for a glimpse, can't get enough of him. When Trump took me to the topping-off ceremony at Trump Place, he demonstrated his peculiar populism. When his limo glided up to the construction site, he said to me, "These are the people who love me, and I love them." And it was true. As soon as Trump got out of the car, a huge roar went up, and the construction workers who had gathered to hear him began to laugh and shout: "You're fired! You're fired!" Trump looked around and yelled: "Where's Miss Universe? [He is also a co-owner of the Miss Universe contest.] Did you ever see Miss Universe of Australia?" He jerked his thumb back to me. "Hey, fellas, this guy's writing for The New York Times Magazine. If he writes badly about me, will you kick the [expletive] out of him?" He glad-handed everyone in sight, gave a speech in which he made fun of the sissy construction workers in Florida, dickered with a structural engineer over a bid for work on a projected skyscraper in Chicago, posed for pictures and climbed back into the limo to shouts of "Take it easy, Donald!" And then he took out a stingingly alcoholic hand towel and rubbed away the traces of promiscuous human contact. Maybe it's an example of what Marxists call "false consciousness," but Trump really is a populist plutocrat -- and not because he's philanthropic or even liberal-minded. It's the opposite: people seem to like him because he loves his money and spends it just the way they would if they had it -- as if he had just won a reality show himself in which the prize is absolutely everything. He lives, or at least perches, in the rococo majesty of a Trump Tower triplex, and he has every toy a boy could ever want: a plane and a helicopter, golf courses and, above all, babes. Maybe his hair is as ridiculously concocted as some nouvelle-cuisine dessert, but what does he care? He's engaged to Melania Knauss, a Slovenian supermodel. (O.K., model.)
But what makes Trump Trump is not just what he has but what he doesn't care about having: status. Trump is not a patron of the arts; he does not sit on the boards of museums or universities or think tanks. His self-love simply will not brook the idea of a superior station to which you gain access by virtue of taste or values or behavior or whatever it is you might be supposed not already to have. Trump does not even recognize that some people look down on him; he assumes they must be looking up. And he knows why, too. "The people that don't like me," he explained on our way back from the topping-off, "are certain rich people that are jealous of the show, because they walk down the street and nobody knows who they are, and nobody gives a damn." Everybody wants what Donald has.
When I asked Michael Jacobson, the editor and publisher of Trump World, what the message of the new magazine would be, he replied, "It's O.K. to be arrogant when you're that rich; it's hip to be a little arrogant and confident and sure of yourself." Yes, that certainly would be a message for our time, but it's easy to miss how very reassuring Trump's peculiar species of arrogance can be. Both the Martha and the Ralph brands betray the class aspirations (or perhaps insecurities) of their founders, the classically American wish to jettison your somewhat humble origins in order to find a place in the upper reaches of WASP society. Trump represents the opposite end of this Henry James spectrum: the American who swears by the democracy of money. Like George W. Bush, Trump manages to seem plebeian even as he consumes at a level made possible only by great wealth.
In 1995, Trump purchased the magnificent mansion in Bedford, N.Y., where Katharine Graham, the late publisher of The Washington Post, grew up. After he insisted that it was the finest house on the best land in the richest community, etc., I broke down and paid a visit. And it was true: here was the Ralph Lauren dream incarnate, with brilliantly polished limestone walls, a flagged inner courtyard, vast rooms, a marble indoor pool and splendid grounds with a fine pergola and orangery. The next time I saw Trump, I asked why he hadn't moved in there himself. "It's sort of not me," Trump said. "If I had my choice, I'd rather live in a golf villa at Trump National, roll out of bed to the driving range, hit balls." In fact, Trump was much prouder of the deal than of the house. He says that he bought the 55,000-square-foot house as well as another smaller mansion and 250 lovely acres for $8 million. Originally he planned to build a golf course, with the mansion as clubhouse. Now that he already has Trump National nearby, he has decided to subdivide the property into 17 lots, each with its very own mansion, and sell them for an average of $35 million. That would be $600 million or so coming out of an $8 million investment -- if you don't count the tens of millions Trump would have to spend on infrastructure and construction. And if he can actually sell the lots at that price. And if he can actually do what he says he wants to do. Is Trump for real? Is he what he says he is on "The Apprentice," the supreme artist of the deal and the biggest developer in the toughest town? Is he really worth billions? Or is he some sort of master illusionist who earns a very nice fortune by blowing gorgeous bubbles? This has been the great question of the voluminous Trump literature, and it has been motivated both by Trump's own obfuscations and by the intense dislike he sometimes inspires. It has always seemed unjust, at a cosmic level, that a man could live as if he alone could defy the laws of gravity, brag about doing so and then get away with it. Surely fate would melt his wings. A spate of such accounts appeared when Trump was facing bankruptcy more than a decade ago. In "Lost Tycoon," for example, Harry Hurt III wrote that the combination of the wreckage of Trump's marriage (to Ivana) and the impending annihilation of his fortune would reduce him to a "public laughingstock" and indeed signal "the end of the so-called greed decade of the 1980's."
So much for cosmic justice. Just as the greed decade of the 80's gave way to the greed decade of the 90's, so the Golf Club Donald of today rose from the ashes of the Atlantic City Donald of yesterday. By 1990, Trump had run up such enormous debts that ruin seemed all but inevitable. His annual interest payments on $2 billion in bank loans and more than $1 billion in bonds sold to finance the purchase of the casinos exceeded his cash flow. Forced to throw himself on the mercy of his banks, Trump bluffed and bargained his way out of the hole with a sang-froid that even his worst critics have acknowledged. In the end, he received a short-term infusion of capital and restructured the bank debt on more favorable terms; in exchange, he agreed to sell off his most egregiously nonperforming assets and to accept a monthly "allowance" of $450,000, which he proceeded to ignore. And then he started buying up property in the depressed market of the mid-90's, beginning with the Briarcliff Manor golf course. "Other guys were going bankrupt, and I wasn't necessarily supposed to be bidding on things," Trump crowed to me. "But the banks said . . . I don't know, I just bought it." Trump had Tom Bennison, senior vice president of the ClubCorp, which owns major golf clubs, call me to offer testimony on this account. Bennison said that Trump "took what in my view was a fairly mediocre golf course and made it a great golf course." Bennison added that Trump has been able to charge vastly greater initiation fees -- upward of $300,000 -- than the old-line clubs whose hegemony he hopes to challenge.
Trump now owns, among other things, four golf courses, the Bedford estate, two large tracts for subdivision in a less rarefied precinct of Westchester County and Mar-a-Lago, his private playground in Palm Beach, Fla. He is planning to build a luxury condominium on a choice plot on the Strip in Las Vegas, as well as another in Chicago for which, according to newspaper accounts, he has already sold $500 million worth of apartments. Both buildings will, of course, bear his name. In Manhattan, he owns Trump Tower and the mighty triplex, with all the solid-gold accouterments therein; Trump World Tower, a 72-story luxury residence near the United Nations; and 40 Wall Street, an office building. He owns half of "The Apprentice" and half of the Miss Universe contest. He controls a significant portion of Trump Hotels and Casino Resorts, which owns and operates three casinos in Atlantic City. And he's got that half ownership in the gigantic Trump Place. So why cavil?
Well, first there's what you might gently call an epistemological problem. In conversation, Trump does not bother to distinguish between the promotional and the actual, so that words like "own" or "bought" or even "stories" -- as in a building's height -- take on whatever meaning he deems useful. He told me, for example, that two years ago the Japanese owners of the land under the Empire State Building "gave me half the deal to be their partner" and that "I sold it to Peter Malkin" for $57.5 million. When I ran this story past an official at Malkin's real-estate development company, he laughed and told me what Trump had told him: that the Donald had proposed to the Japanese owners that he go to court to invalidate the long-term net lease on the building and thus vastly increase the value of the ground and that the Japanese in turn had promised to pay him part of the profit from an ensuing sale. But Trump's lawsuit was dismissed, and the Japanese were forced to sell at a negligible profit of $15 million after holding the land for more than a decade. Subtracting the litigation costs, the official estimated that Trump "got a couple of million dollars, I think." Trump confirms that narrative, but says that he was fully reimbursed for the litigation costs, and he adds that he made a pretty nice piece of change for "about two minutes' worth of work a month."
Trump is only the biggest developer in New York if you count this Trump Place as "his," thanks to his supposed 50 percent ownership. But it is almost universally believed in the real-estate industry that Trump's deal with his Chinese backers is similar to what he worked out on the Empire State Building and other projects: a sizable management fee and participation in profits, in this case amounting to 30 percent. Trump angrily swore to me that this was wrong. And several days after I had put in my request for documentary evidence, I received a letter from one Barry C. Ross, attorney for Hudson Waterfront Associates, the Hong Kong-based financiers of Trump Place. The letter asserted that "Donald Trump is a major partner in the aforesaid companies . . . and not merely someone receiving a fee for the development of the project." This phrasing was, of course, completely consistent with the view that Trump gets a fee and major profit participation, and I said as much to him. Trump gave me the first really stern look I'd seen since we had met. He said, "'Major partner' -- what do you think that means?" I pointed out that the term was scarcely synonymous with "50 percent ownership." The all-knowing Norma was standing nearby, and Trump shot her a look that seemed to mean, "What can you do with these people?" It occurred to me that he may use "I own half" as a term of art, though I very much doubt that Hudson Waterfront understood it that way. Does he also use "billion" as a term of art? Trump told me that Forbes magazine had calculated his net worth at $2.5 billion, though the real number, he said, was $6 billion. In fact, in its most recent profile of Trump, Fortune noted that "weeks of digging" into Trump's finances "yielded only murk." Trump's real-estate holdings are private and thus ultimately no more penetrable than he wishes them to be. On the other hand, the public company that holds his casino properties lost money for years thanks to the massive debt that Trump assumed, and now the company itself has been forced to reorganize through bankruptcy. If all goes according to plan, the bondholders will refinance the debt at more advantageous terms in exchange for cash and a stake in the company; Credit Suisse First Boston will inject $345 million in fresh capital; Trump's ownership position will be reduced from 56 percent to about 25 percent; and he will relinquish the title of chief executive (though he will remain chairman). But Trump still must invest $55 million of his own to revitalize the increasingly shopworn properties. If he can't come up with the money, not only would he lose all control of the casinos, but he would also find it hard to keep repeating the $6 billion figure with a straight face.
Why should all this matter? Shouldn't we just say that Trump is really rich and that he's a really big developer? But it's Trump himself who won't let the issue lie. He keeps threatening to sue reporters who question his numbers. It is, in the end, a matter of brand protection. The Trump brand would probably survive a bit of legal trouble, as the Martha brand, for example, may not. On the other hand, his brand might be severely compromised if Trump were, say, knocked off the Forbes 500, the rich-man list that he has always tirelessly lobbied. So much of Trump's success -- the premium he earns on his apartments and his golf courses, the millions he gets for the use of his name by developers in South Korea, the Trump Signature Collection-to-be -- depends on the aura of stupendous success he projects. The genius of "The Apprentice" from a marketing perspective is that it treats Trump's supremacy as unarguable fact, thus ensuring that the viewer will do so as well. Trump may not be the living incarnation of business, or even of real estate, but he has made a fortune by behaving as if he is. If there's one person who fully accepts the premise of "The Apprentice," it's Donald Trump. At one point he said to me: "I feel strongly about the fact -- and I don't think you've heard this before -- that I consider myself to be a great builder. I don't consider myself to be a great promoter." Actually, I had heard this before, since he had repeated the same sentiment in virtually the same words to another interviewer. Trump hates the idea that he is some kind of postmodern "virtual" mogul; he insists that he has made a fortune by seeing great opportunities, negotiating regulatory mazes, building the best buildings. He bought 40 Wall Street, a derelict property that had passed through the hands of half the developers in New York, for a pittance, held on to it through bad times and then spent a fortune refurbishing it; now the building is fully leased. "They say it's the single best per-capita real-estate deal made in 25 years," Trump said. "Who says?" I asked. "Everybody," Trump said.
It turns out that it was a great deal. Percy Pyne III, a developer who represents the firm that owns the land under the building, told me that Trump "took a hell of a risk with his own money" and "did a marvelous job" finding major tenants. Pyne then mentioned another deal of Trump's, involving the Nike megastore on East 57th Street, that he considers even more impressive. "Donald," he said, "is very creative." And you hear the same thing even from people who consider Trump preposterous, or devious, or both. Trump's peers, most of them painfully respectable, wish that he weren't the public face of their industry, but they generally acknowledge that he is very good at what he does.
Of course, being very good only gets you to the Bill Zeckendorf level. You don't get a board game named after you, you don't have your effigy in Madame Tussaud's Wax Museum, unless you also crave the adulation of millions of strangers. And Donald Trump, who does not believe in much, is a zealot in the cult of fame. It is, for him, the bottom line of all bottom lines. One day he was telling me about the major figures -- "the biggest people, the most white-shoe people, people that you see at the art galleries" -- who had called "begging" to appear on "The Apprentice," even if they would deny ever watching the show. The whole thing filled him with gleeful scorn. "Does everybody want to be famous?" I asked. Trump looked at me as if I had given him cause to question my sanity. "Everybody wants to be famous," he shot back, "but no one wants to admit it." He loved this hard-boiled aperçu so much that he repeated it: "Everybody wants to be famous, but no one wants to admit it."

Trump Hotels and Casino Resorts Inc., the flagship of Donald J. Trump's faltering casino holdings, said late last night that a recently announced deal with Credit Suisse First Boston to inject fresh money into the debt-laden concern had fallen apart, raising doubts about how much longer the company could remain in operation without filing for bankruptcy protection or being taken over by another gambling company.
Trump Hotels has a $73.1 million debt payment coming due in November, and the company's financial coffers have been so severely strained that casino analysts and bondholders have questioned whether the company will have the resources to make that payment.
The company had to delay a similar payment in May for 30 days while it scrambled to put together the money that it needed.
Mr. Trump and other Trump Hotels executives could not be reached for comment last night, but the company said in a statement that it planned to try to negotiate a new restructuring with bondholders.
The company also said that Mr. Trump, who is Trump Hotels' chief executive and owns a 56.4 percent stake in the casino concern, might try to privatize the company, a move that would be difficult given the tangled and tattered nature of the finances of Trump Hotels.
In August, Trump Hotels said that it planned to file for bankruptcy protection by the end of September, which it hoped would allow it to reorganize under new management and with fresh financing to ease a $1.8 billion debt burden that has prevented it from paying for much-needed casino and hotel renovations.
Under the terms of that agreement, Mr. Trump would have given up his title as chief executive and would have had his equity stake reduced to about 25 percent. But to retain even that stake, Mr. Trump was required to make a series of investments in the company, including a $55 million cash investment and an exchange of the Trump Hotels debt that he owns.
Credit Suisse, the investment bank that has been intimately involved in trying to restructure Trump Hotels over the last several months, had planned to invest $345 million in the reorganized company.
That investment would have accompanied and required major financial concessions by other bondholders of Trump Hotels, an uncertain component of the repackaging given Mr. Trump's shaky relationship with his debtholders.
Trump Hotels had planned in August to file for bankruptcy protection under Chapter 11, which typically gives a company legal and financial breathing room to steady itself and ideally re-emerge as a healthier entity.
But last night's announcement that the Credit Suisse deal is off raises questions about the future of Trump Hotels.
Although Mr. Trump has routinely offered optimistic assessments of his casino company's fortunes, the company's numbers tell a different story.
Trump Hotels reported a second-quarter loss of $17.6 million, or 59 cents a share, compared with a loss of $10 million, or 46 cents a share, in the period a year earlier, a measure of how poorly the company has been performing. The second quarter is typically strong for casinos.
More ominously, Trump Hotels' cash reserves are shrinking. The company said in its quarterly filing that it had $81.1 million on hand, down from $124.3 million in the first quarter of this year.
The company had $106 million in cash on hand at the end of the second quarter last year.
Although Mr. Trump has enjoyed a star turn as a business guru on the hit television show "The Apprentice," his casino company has never been profitable since going public in 1995.
The collapse of talks to secure financing for the struggling casinos of Donald J. Trump left him -- the largest shareholder -- scrambling to find alternate solutions, casino analysts said yesterday, and facing the possibility of the company's filing for bankruptcy protection.
When Mr. Trump and his partner in that potential reorganization, Credit Suisse First Boston, announced late Wednesday night that their talks had collapsed, the future of Trump Hotels and Casino Resorts Inc. was again thrown into doubt.
"I think this could get ugly because we're about to see a very high-level game of chicken," said Dennis J. Drebsky, a New York bankruptcy lawyer who has been involved in the restructuring of other Atlantic City casinos. "Your guess is as good as mine as to what happens next."
To help Trump Hotels dig out from beneath $1.8 billion in debt that has hurt the company's operations, Credit Suisse was planning to inject $345 million into the company, with Mr. Trump on board to invest $55 million.
All of that hinged on getting bondholders in Trump Hotels to accept a discount on their debt holdings, something no one involved in the talks was able to do, according to two people briefed on the negotiations.
Without unified support from the bondholders, the deal fell apart. Analysts said that Trump Hotels now has to look for new investors, or restructure its debt and its relationship with bondholders without the help of a third party, or sell itself to a rival.
Indeed, during the last week, a possible sale of Mr. Trump's flagship casino, the Trump Taj Mahal Hotel Casino and Resort in Atlantic City, was considered but never pursued.
Mr. Trump, who is the chief executive and owns about 56 percent of the company, confirmed yesterday in an interview that talks about a possible sale of the Taj Mahal had taken place.
"Some people were looking at it but it was of no interest to us," he said.
Mr. Trump said that he expected a quick resolution of the financing problem for Trump Hotels.
"I'm very energized about the future of the company," he said. "I believe that our lenders are very excited about it, and I look forward to doing something in the not too distant future. I may be talking to you about it next week."
A Credit Suisse spokeswoman said yesterday that the firm was "disappointed we will not be partnering with Trump Hotels and Casino Resorts as we had planned."
Although Mr. Trump said that he would consider taking his company private, a move that would invite close scrutiny from securities regulators, some analysts said that was not a realistic option.
Jane Padreira, an analyst at Lehman Brothers, said the possibility of taking the company private was "Donaldspeak."
She said one option for Mr. Trump was to put part of his casino company, the part that included the Taj Mahal and had a $73.1 million debt payment due in November, into a bankruptcy proceeding.
Ms. Padeira said: "He can save face now, saying, 'It wasn't my fault; I had someone to buy the company, the bondholders were unreasonable and wouldn't allow it to happen."'
Restructuring talks began in earnest earlier this year and gained momentum after Trump Hotels announced in August that it would file for bankruptcy protection as part of a reorganization with Credit Suisse and seek concessions from its bondholders. Those involved in the talks said that the bondholders were largely, but not entirely, unified, a situation that ultimately helped make restructuring negotiations untenable.
Mr. Trump did not lead the talks with Credit Suisse for Trump Hotels. That task fell to Scott Butera, executive vice president of Trump Hotels, who, along with Credit Suisse bankers, spent most of the time negotiating with the casino company's bondholders.
"It's always a tough thing to pull together, all these constituencies," said a Trump Hotels' bondholder with direct knowledge of the negotiations. "We still have our properties. It could be back to Square 1 or it could be that they will approach us again."
The overall stock valuation of Trump Hotels is $14 million, with slightly more than half of the company owned by Mr. Trump. Given the company's financial prospects and its unwieldy structure, some analysts say outsiders may be hesitant to become involved.
"Trump Hotels is a very risky proposition because they're midlevel casinos in a market with far more upscale casinos that have more money and better management," Mr. Drebsky, the bankruptcy lawyer, said.
"Trump's casinos haven't made any money since 1995 during a time when the casino business was very good. There's got to be a reason for that and it's not going to go away. The management hasn't been particularly sparkling."
Whatever the outcome of Mr. Trump's current travails, some people who follow the industry say the next few weeks offer the prospect of first-rate theatrics.
"We should have 'The Bondholder Restructuring Show' -- forget 'The Apprentice,"' said Barbara Cappaert, a financial analyst with KDP Investment Advisors.
"We should have the restructuring negotiations live on television."
What is appealing about Donald J. Trump is his innocence and neediness (James Traub, Sept. 12). His brashness is that of a child in a playground, fists clenched, voice overly loud, desperately wanting friends yet driving them away by his very demands for their attention. "Look at me, watch me, love me," he seems to be saying. "Look at my TV show, look at my deals, look at my buildings."
Our elevation of such a childlike personality to the status of cultural icon says as much about ourselves as it does about him.

 WASHINGTON, Oct. 2 - One month before Election Day, President Bush sought Saturday to make sure that Americans knew he was signing into law a fourth tax cut in four years.
 On Monday in Iowa, Mr. Bush will sign legislation extending three popular middle-class tax breaks and reviving some expired business tax incentives.
 Ahead of that signing ceremony, he used his weekly radio address on Saturday to get maximum political mileage out of the cuts.
 "This bipartisan law is good news for America's families," the president said. "It keeps in place major portions of the tax relief we passed over the last three years."
 The tax package, which Congress passed last month, will affect an estimated 94 million Americans, mainly through its provision to extend a broader 10 percent tax bracket. It also keeps the per-child tax credit at $1,000 and retains the provisions providing married couples relief from the so-called marriage penalty.
 The package extends the child credit for five years, the marriage penalty relief for four years and the expanded 10 percent bracket for six years. All were to have expired Jan. 1.
Mr. Bush revived a tactic from his 2000 campaign, when he regularly rolled out "tax families" to put a human face on his proposals. In the radio address, he cited a Springfield, Mo., family he said would benefit.
 Mr. Bush said his Democratic challenger, Senator John Kerry, had opposed the tax cuts. In fact, Mr. Kerry agreed on the need to retain the personal income tax cuts.
There are probably very few social experiences in life more daunting than being the subject of a Friars Club roast, a slash-and-burn salute that involves sitting still while a bunch of foul-mouthed comedians lob off-color remarks about your career, your looks, your spouse (or spouses), your lack of sexual prowess and even -- God forbid -- your hair.
So some credit should be paid to Donald J. Trump, who smiled and laughed along yesterday afternoon as he sat for two and a half hours in a ballroom of the New York Hilton, while a series of comics, celebrities and so-called friends absolutely savaged everything from his brushes with bankruptcy (his casinos have seen better days) to his fiancée (Melania Knauss, who is young, pretty and accented) to, yes, his infamous comb-over (just plain bizarre).
But not too much credit. Mr. Trump, after all, is widely known for what might politely be called a healthy sense of self-worth, a character trait that seems to have been only amplified by his recent turn as the star of "The Apprentice" on NBC. So it didn't take long for the speakers at yesterday's roast to put him in his place.
Stewie Stone, a long-time Friar and an Atlantic City regular, told Mr. Trump that he'd read his book about how to be a billionaire. "But if your father wasn't one first, you'd be a waiter in this hotel," he added.
Mr. Stone was one of the lesser-known guests on an epic 75-person dais, a lineup that ranged from a "Who's Who" to a "Who's That?" It included oddities like Richard Hatch (of fast-fading "Survivor" fame), the boxer Michael Spinks and the crusty actor -- and perpetual joke target -- Abe Vigoda, whose introduction began, "If Abe Vigoda were alive today. " (The crowd howled.)
It was a guest list that resulted in a bevy of once-in-a-lifetime seating juxtapositions, including the Rev. Al Sharpton chatting amiably with Stone Phillips, the "Dateline NBC" anchor, while two seats down, Victoria Gotti, the Mafia mom, tried to smile while she and her children's own reality show, "Growing Up Gotti," was trashed.
"Jewish parents put money away for college," Mr. Stone riffed. "You put money away for bail."
On the other side of the lectern, Mike Wallace sat between the perpetually sunny Katie Couric (who blushed a lot) and the onetime cover girl Cheryl Tiegs, currently featured in a "new spread in AARP magazine," the comedian Jeffrey Ross said.
At the center of it all was Regis Philbin, the morning-show host who acted as M.C. (wearing a pink tie identical to Mr. Trump's) and warned the guest of honor early on that it wasn't going to be pretty.
"These people are trained professional killers," Mr. Philbin told Mr. Trump. "They want to say things in public to you that they've been saying behind your back for years."
That said, Mr. Trump's aura is apparently quite potent. Freddie Roman, the dean of the Friars, said the event was one of the best attended in the history of the group, a private club for entertainers, which was founded 100 years ago and first raked a victim over the coals in 1949. "We only roast the ones we love," Mr. Roman said.
Indeed, many of the speakers yesterday spent at least a sentence or two praising Mr. Trump and his contributions to the city, including Robert Klein, who thanked him for helping to save the Wollman Skating Rink in Central Park. "Even with the ego and everything else, this is a great New Yorker," Mr. Klein said.
Such sentimentality, however, was the exception. More common was a kind of systematic skewering of Mr. Trump's best-known foibles, including his penchant for slapping his name on each and every one of his properties.
"The reason Trump puts his name on all his buildings is so that the banks know which ones to take back," said Rich Vos, a comedian who came in second on the NBC's talent contest "Last Comic Standing."
As Mr. Vos exited, Mr. Philbin added, "That was Rich Vos, and that might be his last public appearance."
But even Jeff Zucker, president of the NBC Universal Television Group and the man who put "The Apprentice" on the air, had a few jabs for one of his biggest stars.
"Donald, I got the invitation for the wedding, but I can't make it," Mr. Zucker said. "But I'll catch the next one." Getting a big laugh, he continued, saying that the wedding would be great, with a cigar room for Mr. Trump's friends and "for Melania and her friends, a bouncy castle."
Poor Ms. Knauss (born in 1974), who will be Mr. Trump's third wife and is actually far too old for a bouncy castle, took a great deal of ribbing, especially from the two women who roasted: Susie Essman (from HBO's "Curb Your Enthusiasm") and Lisa Lampanelli, who wore a nun's habit and cursed a blue streak. "He seems very happy," Ms. Lampanelli said, "with his beautiful fiancée, Insert Name Here."
Ms. Essman was no kinder.
"You know what she sees in you?" Ms. Essman said to Mr. Trump. "A billion dollars and high cholesterol." (That was, for the record, the only joke the salty Ms. Essman told that could possibly be published in a family newspaper.)
After all the assaults, Mr. Trump stepped to the microphones, apologized to his future wife for the abuse, thanked Mr. Zucker for the job and told everyone the show was over.
"Go home, go to work," Mr. Trump said, "and watch your language."
The Metropolitan Opera can excel on occasion at making a spectacle of itself. On Saturday night the spectacle was Verdi's "Aida." This is a good fit because "Aida" -- unlike some other perennial favorites that are often given extravagant stagings -- was actually conceived as grand opera. The 1988 Met production by Sonja Frisell doesn't deliver elephants, but it does offer a couple of tusks in the Grand March, as well as lots of dancers, stone Pharaohs and a few horses shuddering under the shining onstage trumpets.
I'm a sucker for Verdi, and the pleasure of hearing and seeing a big "Aida" outweighed the vexations of a so-so cast. At least most of the singers could make the thing fly, though only Dolora Zajick, as Amneris, possessed an instrument worthy of the music. She has a ringing mezzo with a trombonelike lower extension and clean top that threatened, in the Act I finale, to blow everyone else off the stage.
Juan Pons, as Amonasro, and Franco Farina, as Radames, had large enough voices, but neither delivered the music with much finesse. Mr. Pons bellowed, while Mr. Farina's robust tenor was dogged by a buzz-saw quality.
Whatever promise I earlier discerned in the soprano Fiorenza Cedolins, it was not the promise of an Aida, a role several sizes too large for her. She sought to mask her deficits -- an almost nonexistent low register and an inability to reach the top notes -- with a certain amount of vocal swooping, while she tossed her head from side to side like a bad soft-core actress.
The young bass Morris Robinson had a thick, warm sound as the King; and Edyta Kulczak was a strikingly dark-toned Priestess (an offstage part). Marcello Viotti conducted with vigor, reining in the strikingly imprecise principal singers to keep them more or less in line with the orchestra.
"Aida" repeats at the Metropolitan Opera tomorrow and Saturday evening; performances continue through Dec. 8.
Trump Hotels and Casino Resorts Inc., the struggling holding company that controls Donald J. Trump's casinos, has reached a preliminary agreement with its investors to restructure $1.8 billion in debt, fending off a possible bankruptcy filing and leaving Mr. Trump as the company's chairman and chief executive.
The restructuring -- coming less than two weeks before the due date of a hefty bond payment that many analysts suspected the company might have had difficulty making -- is the latest step in the dizzying round of financial deal making that the company has engaged in this year.
According to two people directly involved in the restructuring, which is expected to be announced publicly as early as today, Mr. Trump's stake in the company will be reduced from 56 percent of the shares to about 27 percent. Bondholders will be swapping about $575 million in debt in return for an equity stake that will leave them in control of about 63 percent to 65 percent of the company's shares.
The restructuring is expected to be completed no later than February. One person involved in the deal said that Mr. Trump would invest $55 million of his own cash and exchange $16.4 million in Trump Hotels debt that he controls to maintain an equity stake in the company. This person also said it was possible that Mr. Trump might resign as chief executive in coming months, but that for now the company's investors valued his marketing prowess and wished to keep him aboard.
By shrinking the size of the company's debt, the transaction is expected to save Trump Hotels about $100 million in annual interest payments, giving the company much-needed financial breathing room. Nonetheless, it will still have to pay off hundreds of millions of dollars in overall debt coming due in 2006.
Trump Hotels, which largely operates in Atlantic City, has had difficulty maintaining its competitive position there because it lacks the money to refurbish its properties and expand the number of rooms in its hotels. A recent unsuccessful restructuring bid backed by Credit Suisse First Boston, the investment bank, would have injected as much as $400 million in fresh financing to help overhaul the properties.
Investors and others involved in the deal said that the Credit Suisse transaction fell apart because bondholders balked at what they believed were onerous financing terms imposed by the investment bank.
While in the new deal bondholders will not benefit from the outside expertise the bank would have brought to a company that has suffered from financial mismanagement, three people involved in the current negotiations said the bondholders believed that their increased equity stake offered the promise of a return in the future.
Two people involved in the talks said in interviews last night that Trump Hotels was negotiating with several banks for a $500 million line of credit that would be used to finance an overhaul of the casinos and add new hotel rooms.
The bank loans would be secured by a first lien on all of the company's assets, meaning that if Trump Hotels collapses in the future, the banks, and not the bondholders, would be first in line to recover their losses.
But bondholders, who have had a seesaw relationship with Mr. Trump over the years, are apparently willing to roll the dice in the current round of negotiations with him, betting that their equity stake will remain sound.
One person involved in the recent talks between Mr. Trump and his investors described them as a "lovefest."
Trump Hotels has not been profitable for the last nine years, and its shares, which once traded as high as $34 on the New York Stock Exchange, now sell over the counter for 52 cents.
Trump Hotels and Casino Resorts Inc. said yesterday that it had reached an agreement with bondholders that would reduce its debt through a bankruptcy and leave Donald J. Trump in charge.
The agreement would reduce the company's $1.8 billion debt by $400 million as part of a filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, expected by the end of November, Trump Hotels said.
A planned $400 million investment from Mr. Trump, the company's chairman and chief executive, and a Credit Suisse First Boston unit fell apart in September.
Bondholders agreed to swap their debt for $74 million in cash, $395 million in common stock and $1.25 billion in new 10-year notes with an interest rate of 8.5 percent, the company said.
Mr. Trump, 58, would retain his positions, while his equity stake would be cut to 27 percent from 56 percent. He would invest $71.4 million in the restructured company by converting $16.4 million of company bonds he owns into common stock and buying $55 million in equity with cash.
ALBANY, Oct. 26 - Donald J. Trump is one. So are Richard A. Grasso, the former head of the New York Stock Exchange, and enough big-shot real estate people to form a powerful trade group. The late vibraphonist Lionel Hampton was one too.
Their common thread? They were all made police commissioners, honoris causa.
It is a little-known fact that some police buffs who grow up to be successful businessmen, prodigious campaign donors, friends of politicians or a combination of all three can be dubbed honorary police officials and given unpaid sinecures that let them carry around fake badges and, sometimes, play dress-up.
Of course, even an honorary policeman's lot is not always a happy one. David S. Mack -- a big contributor to Gov. George E. Pataki whose brother Earle, a developer, flew Mr. Pataki and his wife to St. Barts on a private jet last year -- drew scrutiny on Tuesday when The New York Post reported that as an honorary deputy superintendent of the state troopers since 1995, he often appears at official functions in full dress uniform.
Lt. Glenn Miner, a spokesman for the state police, said that Mr. Mack, whom Mr. Pataki made a commissioner at the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, is the only honorary member of the force. "He has been a strong supporter of the men and women of the state police for many years," Lieutenant Miner said, adding that Mr. Mack had advised the state police on management and helped them find sites for new facilities. "He's allowed to use the uniform from time to time when attending official events."
New York City has been much more generous in doling out honorary police commissionerships and deputy commissionerships, particularly when Rudolph W. Giuliani was mayor, and more than two dozen titles were handed out, mostly to the well heeled and the well connected.
Mr. Trump, who was made an honorary police commissioner when Howard Safir was the real commissioner, said he had not made any honorary arrests. "All I do is build buildings and be the star of the No. 1 television show," Honorary Police Commissioner Trump said. "I haven't had a chance to use my commissionership yet."
And does he ever don a uniform? "No, not I'm not into that," he said.
But the practice of giving out honorary badges -- powerful symbols of authority that could conceivably be used to, say, try to wriggle out of speeding tickets or intimidate other civilians -- troubles even some of those who carry them.
Pam Delaney, the president of the Police Foundation, a charity that raises money for the New York Police Department, said that she treasured her honorary badge, which she called a great honor. But she added: "Frankly, I would prefer that no one has them, including myself, because of the possibility of their being used inappropriately."
The honorary titles can play havoc with protocol. Howard Koeppel -- a friend of Mr. Giuliani's who was made an honorary police and fire commissioner, and whom Mr. Giuliani later turned to for lodging when his marriage fell apart and he had to leave Gracie Mansion -- found the limits of his titles at a police officer's funeral in 1996.
In an incident that lives on in department memory, Mr. Koeppel made the mistake of trying to sit in the front pew, a spot reserved for the mayor and real police brass. He got what witnesses described as an expletive-filled tongue-lashing from Louis R. Anemone, who was then the hard-charging chief of department.
And sometimes, the badge can be too great a temptation. Ives Nathan, who had an honorary police badge as a trustee of the village of Mamaroneck, used it to pull over a convertible that cut him off during the summer of 2001. The teenage driver turned out to be the niece of a former mayor, though, and after the ensuing controversy Mr. Nathan wound up resigning from the village board.
"Upon reflection, it was probably the wrong thing to do," he said on Tuesday. He added, "The bottom line is that badges don't belong in the hands of politicians."
The Kmart purchase of Sears, Roebuck may be the ultimate expression of that old saying in real estate: location, location, location.
For Sears, location has long meant an address in a suburban or regional shopping mall. For Kmart, the best spots were free-standing stores in cities or not far from them.
With malls attracting fewer shoppers, the chief executive of Sears, Alan J. Lacy, saw fit to buy 50 Kmart stores last spring as part of a plan to increase his company's presence outside of malls, closer to where people live. The talks involved in that sale, Mr. Lacy said on Wednesday, led to the $11 billion takeover of Sears by Kmart.
But is the real estate underlying the deal really as valuable as investors seem to believe? If the plan to put the two fading retailers together fails to turn the new company, Sears Holdings, into a viable competitor to Wal-Mart, Target, Costco and others, it is not clear whether Edward S. Lampert, the billionaire financier behind the merger, will be able to capitalize on all the land and leases his company will own.
"I don't think any retailer should aspire to have its real estate be worth more than its operating business," Mr. Lampert told a crowd of investors, analysts and reporters on Wednesday, promising a successful merchandising business for both chains.
Given the glut of retailing space across most of the country, that is pretty good advice. In the last decade or so, said Paco Underhill, a consultant to the retail industry, too many stores have been added in response to pressure on publicly traded retailers to show higher sales every year.
"There's general agreement within the financial and real estate communities," Mr. Underhill said, "that we are no longer building stores to service new markets, but to steal somebody else's."
Cutting against any real estate strategy is the fact that many of the locations of Sears and Kmart stores are not particularly desirable. Moreover, there are signs that more retail real estate could be dumped on the market next year.
Toys "R" Us, for example, ran into trouble competing with discounters and is now for sale. Bidding for the chain has entered a second round; bankers say a significant part of its value lies in its real estate, much of it in suburban areas. And if the holiday shopping season proves disappointing, there is little doubt that other retailers will jettison some stores.
To be sure, there are plenty of reasons to see Sears' real estate as potentially undervalued. Older chains often have low-cost space as a result of negotiating long-term leases decades ago. A report by Deutsche Bank found that Sears, which began building stores nearly 80 years ago, pays on average $2.06 a square foot for its stores, while Kohl's, a relative newcomer, pays $7.49 a square foot.
Dillard's pays an average rent of $2.64, and May Department Stores pays $3.73.
"The big question is whether the companies are committed to realizing the value" of their real estate, said Louis W. Taylor, the senior real estate analyst for Deutsche Bank and a co-author of the report.
It is clear that was Kmart's intention when it did its deal last spring with Sears. Mr. Lacy said that of the 50 stores he purchased, "roughly speaking, 15 met the Sears demographic." Another 15 had "such a high-density suburban or urban area that you've just got a massive trade area," he added.
Now the new company plans to turn several hundred Kmart's into Sears stores. Stores that do not meet internal profit criteria will be closed and sold, executives said.
Real estate is "a hedge against the downside," said Joshua R. Goldberg, a managing director of Mercantile Capital Partners, a private equity firm. "If you go into a company hoping to improve it and you fail," the real estate provides a backstop, he said. And borrowing money is simpler if some tangible asset is offered up as collateral.
Still, many experts point out that the increasing interest in retail for real estate's sake mirrors the upheaval that retailing itself is experiencing. Many chains built stores too fast, whether free-standing or in malls, anticipating growth that has not come to pass.
And onetime shopper magnets like Sears, Saks Fifth Avenue and Lord & Taylor no longer pull customers into malls the way they once did. In some locations, stores like Target, Wal-Mart and even supersize grocery stores -- not to mention multiplex cinemas -- have become much more desirable destinations. Increasingly, developers see discount merchants as more logical anchors for malls.
A mall that opened in Des Moines recently includes only two department stores in its 1.2 million square feet, where once it would have had four, said John Bucksbaum, chief executive of General Growth Properties, the mall's owner.
A big theater, a sporting goods store and a bookstore provide other draws. And not only that, Mr. Bucksbaum said, "Costco will be opening a free-standing store on the property, the first Costco in the state of Iowa."
But for a rival retailer, while taking over a cheap lease can seem attractive, it is not necessarily easy.
"It's going to be difficult in many scenarios for mall-based real estate to be churned," said Michael Bilerman, an analyst of real estate investment trusts for Citigroup. "Even if Sears owns the stores, it can't just close them up and turn over the keys to somebody else. The co-tenants have a lot of power and the landlords have a lot of power."
Smaller stores in malls cannot veto a Target or a Wal-Mart coming in, said Rick Sokolov, president and chief operating officer of the Simon Property Group, the biggest mall owner in the country. Many, however, have the right to reject their own leases if they are unhappy with the change. And the process of replacing a department store tenant can be lengthy; of seven Lord & Taylor branches that the retailer closed over the last year, only three have been replaced, he said.
For aging shopping malls, one hope is to attract discounters. Both Target and Wal-Mart -- long exponents of building their own one-story, free-standing "big box" stores -- have lately set up shop in some existing malls.
A spokeswoman for Wal-Mart said stores had opened recently in malls in California and Tennessee; another mall, in Valley Stream, N.Y., got a Wal-Mart a year ago in a space that had been a Kmart.
"More often we are building ground-up, but at the same time we do takeovers and redevelopments," said the Wal-Mart spokeswoman, Daphne Moore. "There is not a hard-and-fast policy companywide."
That could prove the saving grace for Sears's mall-based holdings. But it is still not clear that there will be enough interest among other retailers in those spaces.
"Who is the new anchor of the 21st century?" asked Mr. Underhill, the retail consultant, who recently published "Call of the Mall," a study of shopping mall culture. "That is one of the things people are looking at."
Donald J. Trump's struggling casino operation has filed for bankruptcy reorganization, according to court documents, effectively commencing a recapitalization plan that was announced last month.
The Chapter 11 bankruptcy cases were filed Sunday with the Federal Bankruptcy Court for the District of New Jersey and involve 28 entities in the real estate mogul's casino operations, according to the filing relayed by telephone by a court clerk.
 Trump Hotels and Casino Resorts said in October that it had reached an agreement with bondholders that would reduce its debt through a bankruptcy and leave Mr. Trump in charge of the company. 
The agreement would reduce the company's $1.8 billion debt by $400 million as part of the filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy. 
Under recapitalization plan announced in October, Mr. Trump would invest $71.4 million in the restructured company by converting $16.4 million of company bonds he owns into common stock and buying $55 million in equity with cash. His stake in the company, however, would be cut to 27 percent, from 56 percent, as bondholders swapped some debt for an equity stake. 
The 28 corporations on the list of voluntary filings included Trump Marina Associates L.P. and Trump Atlantic City Associates, which indicated in its petition that it had 1,000 creditors or more and $1.3 billion in debt. Assets were put at $1.46 million.
Mr. Trump indicated that he was pleased with the outcome of negotiations with his company's bondholders. "The process has been a very constructive one and should reap great benefits for everyone in the years to come," he said in a company statement today.
Scott C. Butera, the company's president and chief operating officer, said there was overwhelming support for the reorganization plan. "We anticipate that the court approval process will be efficient, and we are excited about the financial benefits which the company should realize from this process," Mr. Butera said in the statement. 
Bear Stearns, Bank of New York, J.P. Morgan Chase and Goldman Sachs are among the largest creditors, according to the bankruptcy filing quoted by news agencies. These and other bondholders held stakes in first mortgage notes due in 2006, according to the filing.
WASHINGTON - President Bush appears to have picked his new cabinet with the view that he has plenty of friends and doesn't need to make new ones. Put another way, he is now the re-elected president of the United States and he is free to get rid of the political celebrities and surround himself with the people he wants.
And so he has. As anyone who watched the job-hopping last week in Washington knows, the president promoted not just men and women he knows and likes. He elevated the most loyal of loyalists, staff members he has worked with for decades, most reaching far back to Texas.
So Secretary of State Colin L. Powell, the international star who had deep misgivings about the war in Iraq, is out. Condoleezza Rice, the national security adviser who was Mr. Bush's foreign policy tutor in the 2000 campaign and begins sentences to reporters with "The president firmly believes," is in.
John Ashcroft, the attorney general much favored by conservatives, whom White House officials saw as a grandstander, is out. Replacing him is Alberto R. Gonzales, the sealed-lips White House counsel who was the chief lawyer to Mr. Bush when he was governor of Texas and was appointed by him to the Texas Supreme Court.
Rod Paige, the first African-American secretary of education, who embarrassed the administration when he called the national teachers' union a "terrorist organization," is out. Replacing him is Margaret Spellings, the low-profile White House domestic policy adviser who worked with Mr. Bush on education issues in Texas.
Ms. Spellings goes so far back in the land of Bush that Karl Rove, the president's chief political adviser, noted at the ceremony announcing her nomination that she had "brutally" turned him down for a date in the 1980's.
Not least, Harriet Miers, the little-known White House deputy chief of staff who was Mr. Bush's personal lawyer in Texas, will replace Mr. Gonzales in the White House counsel's office, a critical incubator of national security and military law since Sept. 11, 2001. Mr. Bush once approvingly described Ms. Miers, whom he appointed chairwoman of the Texas Lottery Commission, as "a pit bull in size 6 shoes."
The changes are a revealing look into the mind and management style of Mr. Bush, for better or worse.
In the view of the president's supporters, the changes show a chief executive in a hurry, with only two years to push through ambitious government programs before he becomes a lame duck. In this view, Mr. Bush has no time to break in unknown cabinet members, and needs people he can talk to in shorthand.
"The fact that he knows them and trusts them tells me he knows there's a limited amount of time to get things done and he knows they're the best people to help him do that," said Nicholas E. Calio, who was Mr. Bush's first White House liaison to Congress.
Or as Newt Gingrich, the former speaker of the House, put it: "There's this desire by the establishment to have Mr. Bush 'mature' by adopting policies and personalities who do not reflect the person who won. This is not a collective leadership; this is the presidency of the United States."
To Mr. Bush's critics, he is rewarding secrecy, consolidating power and stifling dissent. "The good news is that these appointments don't represent the kind of ideological red flags that obviously could upset a lot of people," said Leon E. Panetta, a former chief of staff to President Bill Clinton.
"The bad news is you're not going to make waves. You're not going to have people who are willing to challenge past policies. Generally, in the second term you're a little stagnant to begin with. There is a price to be paid for total loyalty."
White House officials counter that insiders in the first term were far more willing to challenge Mr. Bush than outsiders. As an example, one adviser said that the direct, often undiplomatic Ms. Rice challenged Mr. Bush a lot more behind the scenes than Mr. Powell did, but that such disputes were kept safely within the family.
The loyalty, Mr. Bush's advisers say, goes both ways. Although the president is described as an impatient, demanding boss who snaps at the people he knows well and can use plenty of profanity when he is angry with the staff, advisers say he also goes out of his way to thank personally the lowest person on the White House food chain for a job well done.
Advisers also say that Mr. Bush never fails to ask about their families and tries never to keep them waiting. Above all, they say, he has a gut instinct for who is with him and who is not.
"You go in front of him, and if you know your stuff and don't take yourself too seriously and he can see that you don't have another agenda, he's awesome," said one Bush adviser who insisted on anonymity because the president gets irritated when his staff talks about internal White House dealings. "And if you don't know your stuff, and you take yourself too seriously and have another agenda, he wants absolutely nothing to do with you."
In short, Mr. Bush knows who his friends are, and they're now in his cabinet.
The casino empire of Donald J. Trump has filed for bankruptcy protection after months of negotiations with bondholders over restructuring a crushing debt.
Trump Hotels and Casino Resorts Inc. and several related operations filed for protection on Sunday in Federal Bankruptcy Court in Camden, N.J. The casino business consists mainly of three Atlantic City properties and a riverboat casino in Indiana and is only a small part of Mr. Trump's overall real estate empire.
The filings came even as Mr. Trump, the developer and best-selling author, has returned to the spotlight with the television show "The Apprentice."
In a telephone interview yesterday, Mr. Trump said he would remain chairman and chief executive of Trump Hotels and Casino Resorts, but his ownership stake would be reduced to 27 percent from 47 percent under a restructuring plan reached with bondholders last month. He would still be the largest single shareholder and would still be running the company, he said.
The bondholders, however, will control about two-thirds of the equity, and will be able to appoint five directors, while Mr. Trump can name three. A ninth member will be chosen jointly.
Mr. Trump said he would invest $72 million in the restructuring -- $55 million in cash, and $17 million in notes he already holds.
The casinos will continue to operate, and Mr. Trump refused to call the filing a setback. "In this case," Mr. Trump said in an interview, "it was just something that worked better than other alternatives."
The overall stake of existing shareholders, other than Mr. Trump, will be reduced to 0.05 percent from 44 percent, according to the filings. Shareholders will be issued warrants allowing them to buy more than 8 percent of the company, at 1.5 cents a share, well below recent trading prices.
The Trump casino operations have been fighting to survive amid debt that has hampered Mr. Trump's efforts to maintain and expand the Trump Marina, Trump Taj Mahal and Trump Plaza casinos in Atlantic City. The properties have been hurt by new competitors like the Borgata Hotel Casino and Spa.
The filings list debt of about $1.8 billion. Mr. Trump said the company would also be able to draw on a $500 million credit line.
Pepsi-Cola North America, seeking as much value as possible from its sponsorship of last week's episode of "The Apprentice," has become the first marketer featured on the series to run a commercial with "fired" contestants at the end of the show.
The commercial, by BBDO Worldwide in New York, part of the Omnicom Group, was shot on videotape to resemble the final moments of each episode, known as "the confessional," during which the fired contestant discusses the dismissal while leaving Trump Tower. The spot began with Andy Litinsky, fired moments before by Donald J. Trump, holding a can of Pepsi Edge as he sat in a taxicab.
"I can't believe he fired me, in front of millions of people," Mr. Litinsky said. "I'll never get a job again." The camera shifted to reveal the driver to be Raj Bhakta, the bow-tie-wearing contestant who has become well known since his firing on Nov. 4. "Yes, you will," Mr. Bhakta replied. The actual Litinsky confessional appeared after the commercial break.
NBC, part of General Electric, sold lucrative corporate sponsorships for this season's episodes of "The Apprentice" to marketers like Levi Strauss, Mattel and Procter & Gamble in addition to Pepsi-Cola North America, part of the Pepsi-Cola Company division of PepsiCo. The contestants competed last Thursday to design a new bottle and marketing campaign for Pepsi Edge.
"This season is all about business, so it just works so well in this context," Mr. Trump said in a telephone interview, referring to the commercial's appearance after the firing. "The integration is seamless."
The commercial was shot two weeks ago, months after Mr. Litinsky's firing. To keep bystanders from learning that Mr. Litinsky was the contestant to be fired, BBDO made three versions of the spot, using two contestants still on the show in addition to him.
IF Gordon Chris Griffin owns less than his rightful place in the music history books, he accepts some of the blame. Mr. Griffin is, by his own admission, the trumpeter who refused to blow his own horn.
It's not that he has any particular cause for modesty.
The 89-year-old musician enjoyed a career long enough for him to back both Benny Goodman and the Beatles. In Goodman's band, he was part of a trumpet section the great Duke Ellington esteemed the finest ever, and the list of stars who relied on his high, powerful sound, like Frank Sinatra, Charlie Parker and Ella Fitzgerald, is as full of legends as it is long.
However, throughout his six decades in music, Mr. Griffin, who goes by the name Chris, usually chose the anonymity of a studio musician over the higher-profile life of a bandleader, seldom leading his own groups and never, to the best of his knowledge, releasing any solo recordings, despite numerous offers.
Mr. Griffin said he chose that path partly to be closer to his wife and their six children, and partly because he simply wasn't brassy enough
"Frankly, I never stood up for myself," said the gentle and thoughtful trumpeter, musing on the past from the easy chair in his Southbury condominium. "Innately, I'm a modest fellow. And that can kind of be a detriment in this business."
But recently, Mr. Griffin has decided to break his silence. A biography, written with his assistance, is scheduled for publication next year as part of Rutgers University's "Studies In Jazz" series. And while he no longer plays the trumpet because his dentures make it impossible, Mr. Griffin recently gave a workshop for young players at a jazz camp in Litchfield, and hopes to do more mentoring.
"It never occurred to me that I had an interesting story to tell," he said. "When you're playing, you're always thinking about the next show or the next studio date, and things are hard to put in perspective. I didn't think anyone cared."
Making sure the public knows Mr. Griffin's history is worth caring about has become a labor of love for his fiancée, Louise Baranger. A trumpeter and bandleader more than four decades Mr. Griffin's junior, Ms. Baranger has encouraged him to share his knowledge with others.
"I think the thing about Chris is, he didn't know who he was," Ms. Baranger said. "He didn't realize all these people wanted to hear about his amazing life. This is the only chance they're going have to hear it from the horse's mouth."
Indeed, the list of Mr. Griffin's true contemporaries is small. Of all the members of the Benny Goodman band that played the historic Carnegie Hall concert in 1938, the first time the venerable hall had ever played host to a jazz act, only Mr. Griffin and the vocalist Martha Tilton survive.
But some current musicians still remember Mr. Griffin from his heyday. One of them, Doc Severinsen, a trumpeter as flamboyant as Mr. Griffin is retiring, calls him "as good or better than anybody around then."
"When I came to do a session and I saw Chris Griffin there," said Mr. Severinsen, Johnny Carson's former musical sidekick on the "Tonight" show. "I knew I wasn't going to be playing first trumpet.
"He was a real first trumpet, too. He was direct, exact, and he led the whole band. "He was kind of the point that the band revolved around."
That, Mr. Severinsen said, was one reason Mr. Griffin never achieved the fame of Harry James, the trumpeter who played next to him in the Goodman band. Mr. Griffin's leadership role required him to sacrifice some individuality, Mr. Severinsen said.
"It's a nasty job," he said with a chuckle, "but somebody's gotta do it."
Dan Morgenstern, a jazz historian and the director of the Institute for Jazz Studies at Rutgers University, pointed out that in Mr. Griffin's day, a top-flight musician could earn big money doing radio and studio work.
"He was far too busy working as one of the cream-of-the-crop studio musicians to lead a band," Mr. Morgenstern said. "Many people heard Chris play without knowing it was him, though."
A native of Binghamton, N.Y., Mr. Griffin began playing the trumpet in junior high school, after his family had moved to White Plains. But the novelty soon wore off, and the instrument took up residence in his closet.
That might have been the end of Mr. Griffin's musical career, except for his father's practicality. "My dad one day said: 'Gordon, I paid $29.50 for that trumpet. You must play it. I don't care what you play, as long as you play it."'
In fact, Mr. Griffin's father encouraged him to get up at 5 each morning and practice before school, a habit he jokes "made me very good friends with the neighbors." Yet it was one of those neighbors, a local grocer and amateur pianist, that got Mr. Griffin his real start in show business.
Catching Mr. Griffin listening at his window one day as he practiced, the man invited him in. Soon the two had formed a group, and Mr. Griffin was quickly spotted by other bandleaders and recruited to play New York City dates while still a teenager.
He was part of the saxophonist Charlie Barnet's band, which in 1935 became the first white act to play the Apollo Theater in Harlem. And he became a studio mainstay at CBS, his employer on the night he bumped into John Hammond, the legendary discoverer of jazz talent, who asked him, "Do you think you're ready to join the Benny Goodman band?" often described as the Beatles of their day.
Playing between the trumpeters Harry James and Ziggy Elman, Mr. Griffin helped write jazz history in Goodman's band. "It was a wonderful section," said Mr. Morgenstern, the historian. "They were interchangeable they could all play lead. And when Chris got a chance to solo, he always held his own."
With ultimate confidence, the trio used no music and tuned themselves sharp, to soar above the band. Yet even the bravado of the brash Mr. James faltered on occasion. Mr. Griffin recalls that, just before taking the stage at Carnegie Hall in 1938, Mr. James confessed, "I'm as nervous as a whore in church."
Perhaps that was how a skinny singer from Hoboken felt when he was introduced to Mr. Griffin around that time. "We were eating one night, and this kid comes up and Harry says, 'This is Frank Sinatra.' And he says, 'Oh, gee, Mr. Griffin, it's such an honor to meet you!"' he recalled with a chuckle.
Mr. Griffin's son Paul, who would become a professional trumpeter like his father, remembers the star-studded parties his parents would host. "The first time I ever played the trumpet I was 5 years old, and sitting on Harry James's knee," said Paul Griffin, now 60.
Perhaps the most famous notes Mr. Griffin ever played came during the 1950's, in the ostinato at the end of "The Honeymooners" theme. That piercing coda earned him the nickname "Steel Lips" from the series's creator and star, Jackie Gleason.
But when Mr. Griffin decided, during one episode, to pass off his closing solo to the trumpeter Jimmy Nottingham, he received a terse message the following week: "The fat man wants to see you backstage." He went at once, to find "Gleason sitting there, just like a toad on a stool."
"He said, 'Steel Lips, who played the solo last week?' When I told him, he didn't say a word. He just pointed his fingers like this," Mr. Griffin said, holding his hand in the shape of a gun, "and pointed them straight at me."
In the early 1960's, as part of the orchestra for the Ed Sullivan Show, Mr. Griffin encountered, and played with, the Beatles. Even though he had two daughters who were fans of the Fab Four, Mr. Griffin admitted having to first ask a colleague, "Who are these guys?"
"I couldn't understand the import of it, but I later learned," he said with a smile.
But Mr. Griffin said he grew tired of backing other pop stars he believed "were less than a flash in the pan." And the Sullivan show's fondness for performing dog acts was the last straw, he said. "I played with every dog act in the world," said Mr. Griffin, shaking his head.
He quit and began playing hotel gigs, but said his enthusiasm waned as big bands fell further out of fashion. By the 1980's, he had stopped playing altogether, resigned to his place as jazz's forgotten man. Yet life without music, he admits, was an empty one.
"It was a vacuum," said Mr. Griffin. "I was just existing." His wife, Helen, died in 2000.
Then, last year, Mr. Griffin got a call from Ms. Baranger, a Hollywood native who was researching "Trumpet Blues," a staged tribute to Harry James she had created. She was excited to find one of James's old bandmates still alive, and the friendship they struck up deepened over subsequent interviews.
Last month, Ms. Baranger gave Mr. Griffin a special birthday gift. She transcribed his favorite solo, from the song "Isn't It Romantic," and surprised him with it during a performance at Mohegan Sun casino. "Now, that's thoughtful," said Mr. Griffin, who admitted he got teary-eyed afterward.
Mr. Griffin's son Paul said he was glad his father now has an advocate like Ms. Baranger. "I tried for years to promote him in different places," said Paul Griffin, who keeps a room in tribute to his father at the Griffin House, a Jeffersonville, N.Y., bed-and-breakfast he runs with his wife, Irene.
"At the end of his ninth decade," Paul Griffin added, "it's nice that he can look back on his life and say, 'Well, people finally discovered who I was."'
"Dynasty," repeats an ABC executive, dubiously. Talking into a cumbersome speakerphone, he asks: "Aaron? Will Middle America get it?"
There is a pause before the word comes down from Aaron Spelling, television's clairvoyant: Yes.
The delivery of that yes -- at once so modest and so oracular -- is perfect. And it marks the point at which "Dynasty: The Making of a Guilty Pleasure," a two-hour television movie to be broadcast tomorrow night about the rise and fall of ABC's hit drama of the 1980's, turns really good. As he is played here, Mr. Spelling (Nicholas Hammond) knows that audiences want to see Americans behaving and misbehaving like royalty, and it's satisfying to see a low-key character who trusts his own judgment so absolutely. In Mr. Spelling, we also get a winner whom we know will be spared (so far) a comeuppance -- and that makes him all the more fun to watch.
But it doesn't sound very promising, does it? A television movie about a 20-year-old television series? It rings of narcissistic self-tribute, evidence that ABC, on a roll this season, is willing to push its luck. But if this movie demonstrates nothing else, it's that ABC knows well how to flaunt its victories; flaunting, after all, was what "Dynasty" was all about. In fact, there's something very "Dynasty" about paying such ostentatious tribute to "Dynasty" when a more prudent network, fresh from turnaround, might be shoring up its recent hits.
These just aren't prudent times at ABC; they're "Desperate Housewives" times. Do-no-wrong times. And that spirit comes through in this funny movie, which begins in 1981, with a husband-and-wife team -- she's a producer, he's a writer -- trying to find a way to do an "I, Claudius" for commercial television. Esther Shapiro (Pamela Reed) is convinced that a family strung up in the trappings of wealth would make great television; Richard Shapiro (Ritchie Singer), her husband, is a bookish man who apparently can write anything. From the start, the Shapiros are well aware that ABC wants a show to rival CBS's mammoth hit, "Dallas." (ABC executives already have a title for the copycat show they envision: "Fort Worth.")
In response, the Shapiros rapidly invent the Carringtons, Blake and Krystle, a rich oil-money couple played by John Forsythe (Bart John) and Linda Evans (Melora Hardin); for a time they are styled as moral exemplars. Mr. Shapiro proposes "Dynasty" as a title and, with the benediction of Mr. Spelling, who becomes the show's executive producer, it sticks.
An early plotline involving a gay son, Steven, reflects an effort to establish the show's progressive bona fides. But when the ratings aren't quite high enough, ABC nixes the gay themes, and Steven, who was initially played by Al Corley, is forced to go straight. (Heather Locklear, here played by Holly Brisley, is imported to facilitate the conversion.) When Corley (Rel Hunt) refuses to sell out his part, the producers fire him, and write in a disfiguring oil-rig accident; after an efficient plastic surgery scene, a new actor plays a straight Steven.
But the producers' greatest coup comes in casting Joan Collins (Alice Krige) as Alexis Carrington, Blake's ex-wife. She plays the villainess with relish and is soon the centerpiece of cat-fight scenes with Krystle that at the time seemed to mark television's lowest and highest point. The show eventually hit No. 1.
Melora Hardin is exquisitely Southern Californian as Linda Evans, who first appears doing someone's numerology chart, and ends the movie in love with Yanni.
The movie is less satirical than it has been billed; as a comedy about the soap opera life, it's closer to "Tootsie" than "Soap Dish." The absence of drug-abuse plots or other standard Hollywood melodrama keeps the action fresh. And the film even has some serious moments, which it doesn't overplay. When Rock Hudson (Robert Coleby), whom Ms. Evans kisses in one episode, is found to have AIDS, will Ms. Evans turn out to be infected? The flicker of poignant concern in everyone's eyes evokes the 80's better than all the acetate dresses and shoulder-pad jokes combined.

The popular humorist Dave Barry said his most recent column for The Miami Herald was his last - maybe. Barry, who has written columns for the Miami Herald for 22 years (which have also long been published in the International Herald Tribune), says he is holding out the possibility of a return. But for now, he says, "I want to stop before I join the horde of people who think I used to be funnier. And I want to work on some other stuff." Barry says he will write occasional pieces, weighing in "from time to time if something really important happens, such as a cow exploding in a boat toilet." In the column, Barry thanks his editors and readers: "You've given me the most wonderful career an English major could hope to have. I am very grateful. And I'm not making that up."
The Twenty Nine Palms Band of Mission Indians in Coachella, California, is buying Donald Trump out of his casino. The tribe has announced an early $6 million buyout of its partnership with Trump Hotels and Casino Resorts Inc. The initial $11 million deal two years ago renamed the tribe's Spotlight 29 Casino the Trump 29 Casino. Daily operations were turned over to Trump's company as part of a $60 million expansion. The buyout announcement comes after Trump Hotels filed for bankruptcy last month. A bankruptcy judge this month signed off on a $100 million loan that will keep Trump's casinos in New Jersey and Indiana open while the bankruptcy case is resolved. The buyout is not final until a bankruptcy judge approves it.
A rocker, an astronaut and the inventor of the automatic teller machine were honored by Queen Elizabeth II in her New Year's honors list. Roger Daltrey of The Who and the British-born U.S. astronaut Michael Foale were named Commanders of the Order of the British Empire in Britain's annual accolades for achievement in society, business, culture and sports. Daltrey, 60, received the honor for services to music, the entertainment industry and charity. Foale, who became the first Briton to walk in space, in 1995, and completed a six-month stint on the international space station in April, received the honor for services to space exploration. Figures from the arts world included the children's illustrator Quentin Blake, the actress Anna Massey, the pianist John Lill, and the playwrights Alan Plater and Simon Gray.
Kevin Bacon knew a lot about his character's love interest while shooting "The Woodsman." She was, after all, Kyra Sedgwick, his wife. "Kyra and I have rarely worked together. Between us we've been married 16 years, and this is one of the handful of times we've been on-screen together," Bacon told the Boston Herald. "She had a lot of hesitation about taking the part. She said, 'Look, if there were any other actor playing this part, I'd say yes in a second.' I said to her, 'Look, we don't have a Hollywood tabloid kind of marriage. People are not really all that interested in our marriage because it's a good one and is therefore uninteresting."
John Travolta is almost unrecognizable when he's first on screen in the drama "A Love Song for Bobby Long." His hair is white, and his face is drawn and beaten. Travolta said he worried that if he didn't look that way, he wouldn't be believable, "and that's more frightening to an actor than looking good." In "A Love Song for Bobby Long," Travolta plays a former literature professor whose life has taken an alcohol-fueled nose dive. Scarlett Johansson also stars in the film.


The New York real-estate mogul Donald Trump was tempted to go for a "royal wedding" broadcast on live television until his bride-to-be, Melania Knauss, insisted that some things remain private. But not everything. Knauss, a model, vetoed the live-broadcast plan, but that didn't stop her from breaking a tradition by revealing the wedding dress a week before the big day, on Saturday. Vogue magazine's February issue features the 34-year-old Slovenian on its cover wearing a white satin Christian Dior dress made from almost 300 feet, 90 meters, of material and embroidered with 1,500 crystal rhinestones and pearls. Vogue editors accompanied Knauss to Paris last year to pick out the dress and an account of the trip appears in the February issue. The bride will be seated on a bench because the dress is too wide for a regular chair. Reporting on a discussion last November about NBC-TV's offer to broadcast the wedding live, Vogue said that Trump was intrigued by the idea. "There hasn't been a live wedding since the royal wedding," Trump was quoted as saying. The wedding will take place at Trump's Mar-a-Lago villa in Palm Beach, Florida. It will be the third time down the aisle for the 58-year-old businessman.
Richard Hatch, who became a millionaire when he won the first "Survivor" reality show, will plead guilty to two counts of tax evasion for failing to report income, including the $1 million he won on the show. Federal prosecutors charged that Hatch, 43, filed false tax returns in 2000 and 2001, omitting his income from the CBS show as well as an additional $321,000 he was paid by a Boston radio station. As part of a plea agreement filed in federal court, the U.S. attorney's office in Providence, Rhode Island, said it would recommend a lesser sentence than the five years in prison mandated for each charge. As part of the agreement, Hatch must pay the taxes he owes, which the government said are between $200,000 and $400,000. The agreement does not shield him from any penalties the Internal Revenue Service might impose.
Wong Kar-wai's drama "2046" was awarded top acting honors by the Hong Kong Film Critics Society, and Toe Yuen's animated "McDull, the Pineapple Bun Prince" was named the best movie of 2004. It was the first time the top award had gone to an animated film. The stars of "2046" - Tony Leung and Zhang Ziyi - won the best actor and best actress awards. Derek Yee was named best director for "One Nite in Mongkok," about a prostitute and an assassin who cross paths.
Martin Scorsese has been working on a film about Bob Dylan for two years but there's one key person he hasn't spoken to about it: Dylan. "I'd not like to deal with the man directly," Scorsese said. "I'd like to create the story, to find the story, first of all, and then play it out the way I think it's right." The film concentrates on Dylan's early performing years from 1961 to 1966 and will run this summer as part of the PBS "American Masters" series.
The former "X-Files" star Gillian Anderson has married her longtime boyfriend, Julian Ozanne. They were married on Dec. 29 at a friend's beach house on Lamu island off Kenya's Indian Ocean coast, People magazine reports. The ceremony, which included hymns sung by a Kenyan choir in Swahili, was attended by immediate family and a handful of close friends. Anderson has a 10-year-old daughter, Piper, from her previous marriage to the production designer Clyde Klotz.

Oh, those wondrous canopy shells in the evening sky, those glittery bursts of gold above the Atlantic, that soft cascade of light on the Palm Beach lawn. Alas, it is not to be.
Such was the unanimous decision yesterday of the Palm Beach Town Council, which rejected a last-minute application for a fireworks display at what promises to be this weekend's most-watched social event: the wedding of Donald J. Trump and Melania Knauss on Saturday.
Mr. Trump was approached more than a week ago by the Grucci family fireworks company on Long Island with an offer of an elaborate eight-minute display at the reception, to be held at Mr. Trump's Mar-a-Lago oceanfront estate. The Gruccis offered their services at a discount from their normal fees, which begin around $50,000. At first, Mr. Trump's response was thanks, but no thanks.
But he and his wedding planner, Preston Bailey, apparently had a change of heart; they submitted an application at Palm Beach Town Hall on Tuesday to press forward with the fireworks. A spokeswoman for Mr. Trump said yesterday that the Grucci family had led the effort.
"We were producing a world-class Grucci show replete with music and synchronization that would have taken place at an appropriate time during the reception," said Felix J. Grucci Jr., a former representative in Congress and a senior executive of the fireworks concern, which staged the inaugural display over the Mall in Washington on Wednesday.
"Of course this is disappointing," Mr. Grucci said in a telephone interview shortly after the Town Council voted 5 to 0 to block the Mar-a-Lago display. "It would have been very exciting to do the inauguration of a president and the wedding of Donald Trump in a single week," Mr. Grucci said. "It is not often that you can be part of such high-profile events."
But in Palm Beach, it seems, Mr. Trump's estate is not the only property of concern to the Town Council.
Norman P. Goldblum, a councilman, said Mr. Trump's application called for setting off the fireworks from the Mar-a-Lago grounds, in a town where fireworks are allowed only from barges anchored at a safe distance offshore.
"We have many multimillion-dollar homes here, and we don't want any of them destroyed," Mr. Goldblum said.

PALM BEACH, Fla., Jan. 22 - The traditional thrill of surprise at the gown in which the bride bedecks herself was missing when the former model Melania Knauss and the wealthy real estate developer-turned reality television star Donald Trump were married at Bethesda-by-the-Sea Episcopal Church here Saturday night.
 The bride had already modeled the Dior gown, strapless and dramatically form-fitting from bust to hip, then gathered into mounds and furls of white satin encrusted with embroidery, crystal and pearls, on the cover of the latest issue of Vogue. 
Inside were more photos, including one of the couple of the moment in a double-page advertisement for Donald Trump, the Fragrance, as well as more bridal secrets: The gown was reported to include 90 meters of white satin, the skirt so wide and voluminous that for the wedding supper at Mar-a-Lago, Ms. Knauss was to be seated on a bench. 
Still, there are some pictures that simply do not do a woman - or a gown - justice. And that was one. Shortly after 7 p.m., when Ms. Knauss came down the aisle of the church to the strains of "Ave Maria," she looked magnificent. Her head was completely covered in a swath of white veil, which fell into a 16-foot train, and she carried a small diamond cross and rosary, with roses on either end. 
She was preceded by her older sister, Ines, and Cameron Burnett, son of one of Mr. Trump's partners on "The Apprentice," Mark Burnett,
 When the priest took the couple through their vows, "obey" was not in the lexicon. And when he asked the guests, including former New York City Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton and the singers Billy Joel and Tony Bennett, if they would all enable the bride and groom to uphold those vows, they said quietly, "We will." The priest then exhorted them do it one more time, with feeling, and the 350 or so guests shouted out, "We will."
He also noted that the unity candle lit by the couple had been given to Melania at her baptism, which happened to fall on Mr. Trump's birthday, June 14. 
After the couple was pronounced "husband and wife," Mr. Trump kissed the bride not once, but three times. The crowd cheered before leaving for Mar-a-Lago and its newly refurbished $42 million ballroom featuring 24-karat-gold moldings and 11,000 square feet of marble flooring.
There they sipped Cristal champagne and tasted hors d'oeuvres prepared by the chef Jean-Georges Vongerichten, whose restaurant is in the Trump International Hotel in New York. The reception dinner menu also featured beef tenderloin and individual Grand Marnier chocolate truffle cakes that resembled the seven-tier wedding cake decorated with 3,000 roses fashioned from white icing. 
Later, the boxing promoter Don King, whose diamond cross pendant and two diamond name necklaces nearly surpassed the bride's bling, summed up the event as "a great American occasion."
 "It's a royal wedding," Mr. King said. "It's something out of the monarchy. It's something like, you know, King Henry or King Edward - they've got so many kings it really doesn't matter - would have.' '
 Is there a girl with good cheekbones or a wealthy businessman of but middling good looks who does not know the story of Mr. Trump and Ms. Knauss? He, when they met, had been twice divorced - first from Ivana Trump, with whom he had Donald Jr., Ivanka and Eric, then from Marla Maples, with whom he had Tiffany. 
All four children attended Saturday night's wedding. Ivanka, wearing a slim tangerine dress and looking radiant, did a reading. The furrier Dennis Basso said that he had seen Mr. Trump, 58, with his two sons just before the vows and that, "he was looking a little nervous, just like a traditional groom," which Mr. Basso took to be a good omen.
Ms. Knauss, 34, grew up in Slovenia, where she had but one "s" at the end of her name, but where her life, as she tells it, was otherwise undiminished. Her father, Victor Knaus, who has been variously described as an engineer or an auto repairman, managed a chain of car and motorcycle dealerships, Ms. Knauss told The New York Times in an interview six years ago; her mother was a fashion designer. Her sister is also a designer.
The family prospered; they skied in Austria and Slovenia; in summer they went to the shore. Ms. Knaus started modeling at 5. She graduated from the Academy in Ljubljana at 19, then modeled in Paris and Milan - including for European Vogue. 
Ms. Knauss met Mr. Trump at a fashion party in 1998. Although she said she was strongly attracted to him, when he asked for her number, she declined. "I am not a girl who will just give away the number to anybody," she said. Another reason she refused: Mr. Trump, whose reputation as a sound-bite king is exceeded only by his reputation as a womanizer, was there with a date.
Three days later, Ms. Knauss violated the first rule of the dating handbook for girls and called Mr. Trump. Since the ring he gave her is said to be worth $1.5 million, it may be argued that it is time to jettison that rule.
PITTSBURGH - BEAUTIFUL mind or cruel mind? Here in the hometown of Fred Rogers and Bill Cowher, where a retro-franchise values its own, where a community has survived Big Steel abandonment, Bill Belichick outsmarted the city's throwback heart and outwitted its quaint romance last night.
Such is the harsh power of Belichick's methodical detachment. If Belichick were not able to separate himself from emotion, if he could not inspect his flaws with the clinical eye of a forensics expert, he would not be able to correct his faults.
He admits mistakes when his peers make excuses. And this is his greatest strength: self-evaluation. Bill Parcells can recite the "Man in the Mirror," but Belichick lives by the importance of self-reflection.
Once again, he slipped on his decoder ring last night to make sure that, in his second lap with the Steelers this season, he would not end up twice fooled.
Where did the Patriots go wrong on Halloween? What did Pittsburgh do so right in that game? By simply dissecting that question, the brainiac applied a chaos theory that put the Patriots in the Super Bowl after a 41-27 victory in the American Football Conference championship game.
It may sound contradictory, but this genius redux happens all the time. He is 14-0 as Patriots coach when facing a quarterback for the second time in a season, a sign that he is able to confound and confuse the senses of an opposing team, its star and its coach.
The pressure of matching Belichick's intellect drove Cowher into a panic -- and it was only eight minutes into the game, only a 3-0 deficit. Acting with awkward desperation, Cowher chose to go for it on fourth-and-1 at the New England 39.
Jerome Bettis played the bully who was supposed to kick sand on the Patriots' pencil necks. Instead, he was stopped behind the line of scrimmage and fumbled, the Steelers' second turnover of the game.
"That was huge," Patriots linebacker Ted Johnson said. "It was huge for our psyche and state of mind."
Suddenly, the Terrible Towels were turned into lap blankets as the Steelers played into Belichick's strategy of insecurity. The Steelers were so demoralized, they were caught with their self-esteem down on the Patriots' next play, when Tom Brady threw a 60-yard spiral that hit receiver Deion Branch in stride just before he crossed into the end zone.
"The key to that play was David Givens," Belichick said. "He ran an over route that ate up the corner and safety."
Givens was the receiver the Steelers knew, the one who had 101 yards receiving against them on Oct. 31. Branch, injured and inactive in that game, hadn't entered the Steelers' thoughts. By the end of the game, Branch had become the object of Brady's affection with 116 yards receiving, 37 yards rushing and 2 touchdowns.
This is what Belichick does to opponents. He jukes them with his moves of the mind, going with one player when they expect another, an implementer of decoys and deceptions. "I've been a believer in Bill Belichick for a long time," the Patriots' owner, Robert K. Kraft, said. "He is a very special coach."
He makes other coaches look pedestrian. All week, Cowher went with the stale philosophy mouthed by many coaches: We're sticking with what we do best.
Great, if Ben Roethlisberger was the same rookie sensation he had been in October. Great, if the Steelers hadn't fallen behind so soon, so fast.
The Steelers made themselves predictable. How easy for Belichick.
Unlike other coaches, Belichick believes in evolution, in the opportunity to change with second chances, in lessons learned from mistakes. Other coaches point at players for losses -- as in Herman Edwards's rant against Doug Brien. Other coaches apply the same conservative game plans in times of crisis -- see Schottenheimer, Marty. Others are stubbornly one-dimensional -- as in Mike Martz in Rams Land.
Only a decade ago, Belichick was among the inflexible and the arrogant as the curmudgeon of Cleveland, where he ran off the beloved Bernie Kosar, where he trusted too many Andre Rison attitudes. He alienated the public with his grouchy disposition and imposed his authority on his assistants. Soon, he was out of a job.
He stepped back and changed. After jilting the Jets, Belichick started over in New England by consulting P.R. specialists about his personality flaws, selecting players with a love of the game and surrendering his many hats to his savvy assistants.
So somewhere inside this socially arrested soul, there is apparently a people person. True, he is still grumpy, but he is no longer insulting. True, he is a slouch in an oversized sweatshirt, but it has become endearing.
His hoodie is like the housecoat of a cybernerd waking up with a Big Gulp for breakfast. He is all geek, but Belichick is Bill Gates cool -- a brainiac capable of outfoxing the powers of Steelers passion.
There was Cowher, standing to disprove the attention-deficit gang of N.F.L. owners -- as in Dan Snyder in Washington -- by showing his staying power in Pittsburgh. There was Cowher, a product of Dan Rooney's patience and Pittsburgh genetics in a land where smokestacks once popped up like cake candles on the cityscape.
Cowher had a chance to prove a franchise with an old soul still had a Super Bowl in it. Hard math is cruel, though. There is little room for sentiment in Belichick's beautiful mind.

Donald Trump and the model Melania Knauss were married with all the glamour and glitz that money can buy. Knauss walked down the aisle in Palm Beach, Florida, to "Ave Maria" and guests broke into applause when the real-estate mogul turned reality-TV star kissed the bride. "Oh, it was beautiful. It was all just lovely," the singer Tony Bennett said. Another guest, the boxing promoter Don King, said, "There was a spontaneous combustion of love." The setting for the opulent reception this weekend was Trump's Versailles-inspired ballroom at his Mar-a-Lago estate. About 400 people lined the street outside the church for a glimpse of a celebrity, or even the bride. Also on the guest list were the television personalities Barbara Walters, Star Jones, Matt Lauer, Kelly Ripa and Regis Philbin. Knauss, 34, had posed for Vogue magazine to show off her Christian Dior gown and her large engagement ring. The gown weighed so much (50 pounds, or 23 kilograms) that she planned to slip into a Vera Wang dress after the couple's first dance.
About 10,000 people braved heavy snow in Munich to attend the funeral of Rudolph Moshammer, the flamboyant fashion designer who was murdered this month. The funeral cortege this weekend was followed live by several television stations; it stopped for a minute's silence outside his boutique before a blue-suited marching band led the procession along the streets. Moshammer, 64, was found dead in his Munich villa on Jan. 14 with a cable wrapped around his neck. The police later arrested a 25-year-old Iraqi man, saying he had confessed to the killing. Almost 10,000 people signed a book of condolence.
The Producers Guild of America named "The Aviator," Martin Scorsese's film about Howard Hughes, the best film of 2004. "The Aviator" also was named best dramatic picture at the Golden Globe Awards last week. In addition, the Producers Guild named HBO's "Angels in America" as the year's best TV movie or miniseries, and chose "The Sopranos" as best drama series and "Curb Your Enthusiasm" as best comedy series.
The pop star Kylie Minogue is suing the British record producer who helped launch her career. The Australian singer has claimed in the Victoria state Supreme Court that PAL Productions, run by Pete Waterman, underpaid royalties for her "Greatest Hits" album that was released in 1992 and re-released in 2002, the Sunday Age newspaper reported. Minogue's company is seeking unspecified damages, interest and costs, the paper said.
Bob Dylan's "Chronicles: Volume One" has been named a finalist for a National Book Critics Circle award, along with 24 other books in five categories. "Chronicles," published by Simon & Schuster, was nominated in the biography/autobiography category, along with Stephen Greenblatt's "Will in the World: How Shakespeare Became Shakespeare" (Norton) and Ron Chernow's "Alexander Hamilton" (Penguin Press). Fiction nominees include Philip Roth's "Plot Against America" (Houghton Mifflin), Edwidge Danticat's "Dew Breaker" (Knopf) and David Mitchell's "Cloud Atlas" (Random House); for general nonfiction, Edward Conlon's "Blue Blood" (Riverhead) and "The Reformation: A History" (Viking) by Diarmaid MacCulloch were among the nominees. The awards, which also include poetry and criticism, will be given on March 18 at New School University in New York.

The final words will probably be a little more decorous than "you're fired," but Martha Stewart will soon join Donald Trump in crowning a new generation of young moguls on her own version of "The Apprentice," NBC officials announced yesterday.
The show, which will begin production sometime after Ms. Stewart is released from prison in West Virginia in March and while she remains under house arrest, will feature Ms. Stewart as a less brusque but equally imperious business legend in search of an assistant to help run part of her company, Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia. As on Mr. Trump's show, the winner will be awarded a one-year job with a salary of $250,000.
Mark Burnett, the creator of "The Apprentice" and the producer of a new morning show for Ms. Stewart scheduled to make its debut next fall, said that he had discussed the idea extensively with her before she went to prison in October and that both he and Mr. Trump, his partner in the "Apprentice" franchise, considered her a perfect counterpart to expand the show.
While Ms. Stewart is known for her household advice and cooking skills, the show will focus much more on the business and marketing acumen she used to build a multibillion-dollar company and will try to reveal a side of her that was not a prominent part of her previous television persona. Its contestants - probably 18 a season - will not be baking cakes or making wreaths but competing in tasks much like those on Mr. Trump's show, except in the business of lifestyle, not real estate.
"She's a businessperson, and this is a business show," said Mr. Burnett, who has visited Ms. Stewart once a month since her imprisonment and talked often yesterday about her dogged work ethic, displayed even as an inmate in her zeal in cleaning the prison's floor-waxing machines.
But he added that the show, which he compared to expansions of the successful "CSI" and "Law & Order" franchises, would have a markedly different style from Mr. Trump's and would probably attract a completely different type of competitor. "Martha has her own empire, which is a different look and feel," he said, adding of the show, "It will be what feels natural to Martha."
Ms. Stewart, who was convicted of lying to federal investigators and is not allowed to conduct business while in prison, made no comment about the decision yesterday. In a conference call with reporters, Mr. Trump said that he had long been a friend of Ms. Stewart's and had no hesitations about creating a show for her despite her legal troubles and recent notoriety. "Very few people could have withstood what she's withstood," he said. "It was an easy decision for us and one we believe will really give great added value to our franchise."
Mr. Trump added that he did not know what Ms. Stewart would say to contestants booted from the show but that he was pretty sure his phrase would not suit her. "She's probably going to use a different expression, and she's got a different way of doing things than I do," he said.
Speculation about a possible reality show starring a post-prison Ms. Stewart had been rampant since last September, when Mr. Burnett said he had signed an agreement to create a prime-time show for her. In December, at an elegant news conference at Omnimedia's Manhattan headquarters, he announced the creation of a new morning show for Ms. Stewart, to be taped in front of a live audience.
Jeff Zucker, president of the NBC Universal Television Group, said yesterday that the announcement of the new show, to be called "The Apprentice: Martha Stewart," had been held until now because the network did not want attention for the spinoff to detract from the second season of "The Apprentice" and also because he did not want it to interfere with Mr. Trump and Melania Knauss's wedding last month. He declined to comment on how the two shows would be scheduled but said that he was very aware of the dangers of overexposure, which hurt "Who Wants to Be a Millionaire."
"We do not intend to make that mistake," he said. But he added that local NBC affiliates had already shown great interest in Ms. Stewart's new morning show - 70 percent have bought it so far - and that he believed that her recent troubles had only increased her appeal with American viewers who love comeback stories.
"I think that is part of what the tremendous interest in her will be," he said.
Susan Lyne, president and chief executive of Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia, said in an interview yesterday that she would not be playing an on-air role on Ms. Stewart's show like the ones played by George Ross, executive vice president and senior counsel of the Trump Organization, and Carolyn Kepcher, another executive vice president.
But there is a possibility that other company executives could play themselves on the show. "I imagine that would be feasible, but we haven't had the discussion yet," she said, adding that because most of the plans for the show were made only in outline before Ms. Stewart went to prison, many things are still to be determined.
The level of the job that the winner of the show will receive is also still unclear and to a large extent depends on the talents of the winner, Ms. Lyne said, adding that the company was seeking to expand in several areas, including its presence on the Internet.
"It would be limiting right now to say they'd play this or that role," she said, "but we are looking for someone who can create some new business for us instead of just moving into an ongoing role."
Of Ms. Stewart, whom she has also visited in prison, Ms. Lyne said, "I think she's excited to be able to get on with her life, and that includes a certain form of getting back to work."
Mr. Burnett was asked repeatedly during the conference call yesterday whether he had discussed business with Ms. Stewart during his visits. He insisted he had not and laughed when asked whether he might have employed code words like "celery" or "lettuce" to refer to money or other aspects of the show.
"I'm not good enough in the kitchen to do that," he said.
The final words will probably be a little more decorous than "you're fired," but Martha Stewart will soon join Donald Trump in crowning a new generation of young moguls on her own version of "The Apprentice," NBC officials announced yesterday.
The show, which will begin production sometime after Ms. Stewart is released from prison in West Virginia in March and while she remains under house arrest, will feature Ms. Stewart as a less brusque but equally imperious business legend in search of an assistant to help run part of her company, Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia. As on Mr. Trump's show, the winner will be awarded a one-year job with a salary of $250,000.
Mark Burnett, the creator of "The Apprentice" and the producer of a new morning show for Ms. Stewart scheduled to make its debut next fall, said that he had discussed the idea extensively with her before she went to prison in October and that both he and Mr. Trump, his partner in the "Apprentice" franchise, considered her a perfect counterpart to expand the show.
While Ms. Stewart is known for her household advice and cooking skills, the show will focus much more on the business and marketing acumen she used to build a multibillion-dollar company and will try to reveal a side of her that was not a prominent part of her previous television persona. Its contestants -- probably 18 a season -- will not be baking cakes or making wreaths but competing in tasks much like those on Mr. Trump's show, except in the business of lifestyle, not real estate.
"She's a businessperson, and this is a business show," said Mr. Burnett, who has visited Ms. Stewart once a month since her imprisonment and talked often yesterday about her dogged work ethic, displayed even as an inmate in her zeal in cleaning the prison's floor-waxing machines.
But he added that the show, which he compared to expansions of the successful "CSI" and "Law & Order" franchises, would have a markedly different style from Mr. Trump's and would probably attract a completely different type of competitor. "Martha has her own empire, which is a different look and feel," he said, adding of the show, "It will be what feels natural to Martha."
Ms. Stewart, who was convicted of lying to federal investigators and is not allowed to conduct business while in prison, made no comment about the decision yesterday. In a conference call with reporters, Mr. Trump said that he had long been a friend of Ms. Stewart's and had no hesitations about creating a show for her despite her legal troubles and recent notoriety. "Very few people could have withstood what she's withstood," he said. "It was an easy decision for us and one we believe will really give great added value to our franchise."

Snow Trumps Fire
Q. My son wants me to ask: Has the city ever used flamethrowers to get rid of snow after blizzards?
A. Believe it or not, the city tried. In February 1920, with much of New York snowbound, the War Department sent a detachment from its Chemical Warfare Service in Edgewood, Md., to report to the city's recruiting officer. Someone thought recruiting would be stimulated if people could watch Army men melting snow off the city's streets.
One section of park was roped off for the experiment, but things did not go so well. One of the machines did not work properly, and the other left a smeary deposit of soot over the ledge of snow and ice that was its target. The crowd grew "somewhat derisive," according to a newspaper account, and the experiment was officially declared a failure.
That Dirt Needs Upkeep
Q. I recently visited the art installation "Earth Room" in SoHo, where a large gallery floor is covered with 22 inches of dirt. How do they keep the dirt clean?
A. With loving care. "The New York Earth Room," an installation by the conceptual artist Walter De Maria on the second floor of 141 Wooster Street near Houston Street, has been around since 1977, and the nutrients in the soil -- 250 cubic yards spread over 3,600 square feet -- have become depleted. So there isn't as much of a problem with unwanted plant and animal life as there used to be, said William Dilworth, caretaker of the installation for the Dia Art Foundation, which took it over in 1980.
But Mr. Dilworth had heard stories about centipedes in the early days, and sometimes a few flying gnats can be seen. Plants occasionally grow, and when the gallery is closed, parasol mushrooms have a way of sprouting.
What keeps the installation from becoming an unwanted agricultural project is weekly watering and raking. Mr. Dilworth also hoses down the walls. Because they are painted with an exterior house paint containing fungicide, there is no mold problem with the soil.
Next Stop, Apocalypse
Q. How did Yeats's "Second Coming" happen to be selected for the M.T.A. "Poetry in Motion" campaign? It seems awfully apocalyptic for SubTalk fare.
A. You could argue that if New Yorkers can handle 9/11, they can handle powerful verse about man's bestial nature let loose to walk the land.
Such a sentiment was expressed by Alice Quinn, poetry editor of The New Yorker and executive director of the Poetry Society of America, which helped choose "The Second Coming," a poem first printed in 1920. "The seriousness of it feels totally apt," she said.
The eight-line excerpt included the perhaps timely lines:
The best lack all conviction, while the worst
Are full of passionate intensity.
The Poetry Society does not editorialize, she said, but sits down with transit representatives to discuss which poems to use. The aim, she said, is to choose poems that will be varied, exciting and relevant.
"We are a little conscious of what we're putting on the subway," she said, "and we want the poems to be strong, to register powerfully."
Besides the excerpt from Yeats, which appeared last August through October, other recent poems featured in the subway include "A Bouquet" by Bei Dao, the dissident Chinese poet, and works by Antonio Machado of Spain, Bronislaw Maj of Poland and Emily Dickinson. MICHAEL POLLAK
ENGLEWOOD CLIFFS - BEFORE his boardroom tactics became a reality show, before "you're fired" became a world-famous tag line, back in 1990 when Donald Trump was married to his first wife, he hired Billy Procida. While Mr. Procida was already a young real estate developer, he got the job only after a decade of pleading to serve an apprenticeship.
Like the seat-of-the-pants entrepreneurs on the Net Worth team in this season's version of "The Apprentice," in which high school grads compete with college grads, Mr. Procida leapt immediately into the business world after high school. Like the Net Worth crew, he managed to pile up superlative credentials and an impressive net worth quickly.
Unlike them, however, it took him 10 years of ceaseless campaigning, starting the moment he left 12th grade, to get a call from the chief of the Trump Organization.
"I started writing him letters when I was 18," recalled Mr. Procida, seated in a comfortable chair in his spacious corner office here, where he is a principal in Palisades Financial, a real estate investment firm. "I started out by asking him for 10 minutes of his time."
Mr. Procida, who was christened William, but answers only to Billy, is a 5-foot-6-inch cigar-smoking Roman candle of a personality. He claims he was born with a big ego to compensate for being a "short Italian."
He said he began identifying with Mr. Trump in his young teens before he was politely invited to leave Bergen Catholic High School and sent to public school in Tenafly. Mr. Trump was "the best, the biggest deal around" in the business that Mr. Procida learned from his father growing up in Alpine.
Ten years after high school, when Billy, then 28, finally got to spend a year with "the Donald," he said the most telling lesson he gleaned was about his own cocky attitude: keep it up, or you won't get anywhere.
"People say Donald is arrogant," he said, "but people confuse confidence with arrogance. He creates a perception with his attitude -- the Trump factor, they call it. I quickly saw that his buildings were selling for 25 percent more than exactly the same building put up by somebody else. That's because he created the perception: Trump is the best."
Mr. Procida, who is now 42, started his own career as a builder, constructing a small housing project that his father had approval to build on the East River banks in the Bronx and that was over to him as a graduation present. "My father never pushed me about grades," said Mr. Procida, whose three siblings went to college, "but he expected me to know how many cubic yards of concrete it would take to build a foundation by looking at a set of plans."
Two years into the Bronx job, despite his father's fierce criticism that he was overreaching, Mr. Procida had transformed the project and inflated it to fulfill his own outsize vision. Working with his three-man start-up crew, he created plans for White Beach, a $9 million condo project near the Throg's Neck Bridge, featuring "dock-ominium" units with boat slips, an idea that he claims he invented. Then, he managed to borrow enough to actually build it. All sorts of people were impressed, including New York City housing officials, and the project led to a series of ever-larger contracts, including one to build public housing in the South Bronx.
"I just always knew what I was going to do," Mr. Procida said, flicking away an ash from his Fuente and speaking in a voice gone gravelly after 15 years of shouting at work crews, followed by almost a decade of dealing forcefully with builders who use his bank's money.
"I would always yell, scream, bust my butt, and anybody else's, to get things accomplished," he said with a satisfied smile. Of his investment banking career, he added simply, "I've closed over $2 billion in deals, and never has one of my borrowers failed."
By the time he actually heard from Mr. Trump, Mr. Procida said, he had written more than 100 letters to the Manhattan mogul.
While Mr. Trump was hitting his giant stride, developing the Trump Towers, casinos, hotels and a glittering national reputation, Mr. Procida tried to keep him informed about each of his own triumphs. "Sorry you missed this one," he would write, attaching a news clipping about a successful project. "I'll keep you in mind next time."
In return, Mr. Procida always received a congratulatory form letter. Still, it was a response, said Mr. Procida, who defends Mr. Trump's persona in seemingly every aspect. "What those form letters over the years said to me was," Mr. Procida said, "'Don't give up."'
On the day of Mr. Procida's marriage, Oct. 25, 1985, New York magazine published a lengthy profile of the young developer and his amazing early successes, headlined "The Boy Who Would Be Trump." When he got back from his honeymoon, his mother let him know that Mr. Trump had at last called him, suggesting he "get in here" to see him in Manhattan.
For the next five years, Mr. Procida said, he served in an unofficial and unpaid capacity as "Trump's little mascot."
"He would send me over to look at projects for him," Mr. Procida said, "and he would let me hang around. I'd go to industry meetings, and Donald's got his arm around me, calling me 'baby Trump."' Eventually, Mr. Procida persuaded Mr. Trump to take him on as a vice president.
Today, 15 years later, it is a bit unclear how the employment ended. When Mr. Procida appeared on "The Today Show" last year, he said he had been fired by Mr. Trump after a year as "the original apprentice," but the experience had nonetheless given him a tremendous boost. In an interview 10 days ago, however, Mr. Procida said he had asked Mr. Trump to hire him a "a year, just one year."
In any case, the year of 1990 was a rocky one for Mr. Trump -- the separation from Ivana, the slump in the real estate industry, lenders nipping at his heels -- and a highly beneficial one for Mr. Procida.
Procida Construction, which he ran with his brother Mario at the time, was named New York City Developer of the Year just four years after Mr. Procida parted ways with Trump. "I could never have achieved that without the connection to Trump," he said. "It wouldn't have happened."
A year later, he founded the company that is now Palisades Financial. "When I was with Donald, I learned I didn't have to be the guy who is keeping track of every doorknob," he said. "I learned I was good at seeing the big picture, and knowing what makes a project fly."
Today, the blackboard in Mr. Procida's office is always full of multimillion-dollar projects vying for his attention -- for example, the redevelopment project in downtown Montclair that was recently granted a construction mortgage.
Mr. Procida still sees his old boss at various business affairs, he said, and he still loves to regale people with his story about being the untelevised apprentice. The experience still gives him extra cachet, he admits unabashedly.
"Even with my daughter!" he laughed. "She's 9 years old, and she has a big picture of Donald Trump on her wall."
Suddenly faced with more than one potential offer for the West Side railyards, Peter S. Kalikow, chairman of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, said yesterday that the authority's need to get the highest possible price to keep the transit system running properly outweighed even City Hall's desire for a football stadium and its bid for the 2012 Olympic Games.
Until Friday, the authority had been negotiating solely with the Jets on a sale of the development rights over the West Side yards, which the team wants for a football stadium and the city sees as the anchor for its Olympics bid.
But then Cablevision, which owns Madison Square Garden and has opposed the stadium plans, stunned the team and the Bloomberg administration by offering to buy the property for $600 million, hundreds of millions more than the Jets had proposed.
In an interview, Mr. Kalikow said that he planned to ask the Jets and Cablevision to revise the terms of their offers for the 13-acre property so they can be evaluated on an equal basis.
It was unclear, for instance, whether Cablevision's offer is contingent on getting favorable zoning, and whether the company is willing to accept all potential environmental liabilities, as the Jets are. The authority may also ask for a letter of credit from each bidder to guarantee their offers.
"As important as the Olympics are, my main criteria is getting the best deal for the M.T.A.," Mr. Kalikow said. "I would like to get the Olympics, but I can't let my personal views overtake the goal of getting the highest price."
At a City Council hearing yesterday, L. Jay Cross, the Jets' president, and Deputy Mayor Daniel L. Doctoroff assailed Cablevision's move as a phony last-minute offer designed to derail plans to build a $1.7 billion stadium for the Jets that would double as an Olympic stadium if the city won its bid for the 2012 Olympic Games.
The issue dominated the packed hearing, where dozens of stadium supporters wore green T-shirts emblazoned with "Build It," while a smaller group of opponents wore blue shirts condemning the project.
Mr. Doctoroff said that the authority should get "full and fair value for the site." He said the Jets' proposal for a stadium and convention hall would generate thousands of jobs and "enormous profits" for the city and the state, while sparking the redevelopment of a 42-block area rezoned for high-rise development.
The city and state have agreed to provide $600 million for a stadium roof and a platform over the yards on which the stadium would sit. The city would pay for its share from its operating budget.
Mr. Doctoroff said that Cablevision's offer was not as lucrative as it seemed, because it included the cost of the platform, which he estimated at $350 million. He also said the company's plans for thousands of apartments on the site would undermine development that the city plans for nearby West Side blocks. Therefore, he said, the city would not provide the rezoning that Cablevision's proposal may require.
An appraisal done for the transportation authority, which is facing fare increases, service cuts and a multibillion-dollar shortfall in its capital budget, put the value of the site at almost $900 million. The authority plans to sell a number of assets, including development rights over the West Side railyards, in an effort to raise more than $1 billion.
Mr. Kalikow said he hoped to resolve the issue at the next meeting of the board, on Feb. 24. He said he has brought in a corporate lawyer, Ira M. Millstein of Weil, Gotshal & Manges, to advise the board on the matter, and added that the authority would treat Cablevision's offer with the gravity of a hostile bid for a corporation already in negotiations to merge with another company.
"We'll know very shortly whether the offer has any substance," Mr. Kalikow said.
The Jets have offered only $100 million for the development rights, or about one-third of what the authority has asked for. The authority set the price assuming that the Jets would use only one-third of the projected rights; the rest would be sold to adjacent sites, which would also require zoning changes.
The authority and the Jets have tentatively agreed to have former United States Senator George J. Mitchell arbitrate the dispute.
Mass transit advocates, including the Regional Plan Association and the Straphangers Campaign, and stadium opponents, however, say that the Jets should pay the full value of the property, about $900 million. They have also raised questions about whether Mr. Mitchell, the chairman of Walt Disney, has a conflict of interest.
Disney's ESPN and ABC networks have contracts with the National Football League to broadcast games, which some say may interfere with Mr. Mitchell's ability to evaluate the matter fairly.
Asked about that, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg said yesterday, "I don't think you'd win a lot of points, anybody would, by criticizing George Mitchell's integrity and independence. He's sort of the gold plate."
Some lucky declarers bring home slams with quite weak hands. It is possible to construct a deal in which a grand slam is unbeatable with a combined five high-card points. In practice, there have been deals in which a small slam has been made missing all four aces. The diagramed deal goes one step further: the declarer was missing all the key-cards, that is to say, four aces and the trump king.
The occasion was the 2001 Danish National Pairs Championship. West opened one heart, which would be a popular choice holding both majors, two aces and a singleton. North overcalled two diamonds, which was not ideal, but nothing was.
East's raise to four hearts was reasonable, holding four trumps, two aces and a singleton. It happened that the East-West hands were a bad fit, and the four-heart contract would have had no chance, with down two a likely result. But that would have been a good result, doubled or not, since North-South can make five clubs. Such raises with a good fit generally offer a two-way chance: making the contract or shutting the opponents out of a successful game.
It would have been cowardly for South to pass, and one option some would select is a responsive double, showing length in the black suits. The South player, Ellen Jensen, bid five clubs, certainly a reasonable choice. Her partner, impressed by his club fit, raised to six, which was slightly optimistic since he lacked any top cards that were clearly useful. It was likely that South was void in hearts, and that the king-queen of hearts would have little value.
West should have worked out that one of his opponents held a void in hearts in light of the six-club bid. Any lead other than a heart would have defeated the slam, but he obliged by putting the heart ace on the table. South happily ruffed and reached the dummy with a spade ruff. The singleton diamond was discarded on the heart king, and declarer led a trump hopefully. The king and the ace crashed, and North and South had set a record: bidding a slam voluntarily and making it when missing four aces and the trump king.
AS is, the proposed site for the West Side stadium is a field of unsightly rails on the Hudson River that elicits an image of the stitches on Frankenstein's monster.
As drawn, a translucent-skinned, 18-story stadium will be built as the linchpin to the 2012 Summer Olympic Games, and as a potential site for N.C.A.A. basketball tournaments, conventions and concerts. Also, of course, it is designed as a certain mecca for Jets fans for eight Sundays a season -- maybe 10, if the team can finally master clock management.
As could be, the Cablevision honcho James L. Dolan wins a $600 million revenge bid in his silk pillow fight with Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg to construct his self-proclaimed "dynamic mixed-use community" that turns out to be a soaring metal cable box of uncertain design that constantly scrambles its signals to the public. In other words, it is a structure resembling the Knicks and the Rangers.
As feared, TransGas actually takes the site prize with its surprise $700 million strings-attached bid for political leverage and decides to build something powerful but unknown that glows like Meryl Streep's body in "Silkwood," creating a visual that adds to the city nightscape in a special way only an energy company can.
As likely, the Metropolitan Transportation Authority is played the fool by bidders whose only true design is to muck up the West Side sports and convention center project until July 6, the date the International Olympic Committee will surely decree Paris as the 2012 host, the day Bloomberg officially loses his mojo for his dream blueprints. And then, a day later, all the stadium obstructionists withdraw their bids to the beleaguered M.T.A.
At this point, squatter's rights go back to Frankenstein until years later, when a company like Super Wal-Mart is certain to come along with a fat deal to build a sprawling ode to bulk consumption on the site, offering New York City residents a chance to lug home a 10-pound box of Cheerios on the subway.
Given the site's zoning, no yoga gardens or high-rise condos are in store for the Hudson Yards. So pick your monster: Some day, something will be built over the railyards in a move that will no doubt anger residents, block someone's sunset view of Hoboken across the river in New Jersey, congest traffic on the West Side Highway, disrupt daily lives and leave malleable pols bending for votes in a game of political Twister.
The West Side stadium, warts and all, is the devil you know with the most upside to the migraines considering the seven years of public works projects a hometown Olympics would generate.
Instead of being opened to a power plant project, the Williamsburg area of Brooklyn could house Olympic swimming and beach volleyball arenas. Imagine a velodrome in the Bronx and Olympic-hinged development in Queens.
Think local politics and legal maneuvers will entangle construction in every borough? History shows the opposite occurs for bid cities. When Olympic deadlines are established, the impossible gets done with international embarrassment as a cudgel over petty self-interests.
Think the announcement of NYC2012 as an Olympic host is far-fetched? You don't know the wildly unpredictable and politically fickle I.O.C., which is still smarting from criticism for going romantic and awarding the 2004 Summer Games to an unequipped Athens.
Granted, Bloomberg is wrong for turning all opposition of the West Side stadium into an unpatriotic stance against the Olympics, but his less odious bullying could be instrumental in obtaining the Games.
And, certainly, the resident Olympic cheerleader Daniel L. Doctoroff has a little too much Wink Martindale in his blood for his misty-eyed giddiness and intractable optimism to be believable. But New York does have a decent chance to earn the bid for at least three reasons.
Reason 1: Paris is the favorite, but the vote from the European members of the I.O.C. is not a given for the French, not when bids by London and Madrid could dice the vote, not when other Euros want their own Olympics and realize one Summer Games on their side of the Atlantic will not be quickly followed by another.
Reason 2: An anti-American vote by the I.O.C. is negated by the fact that New York City is considered a sympathetic outcast of the Bush administration -- and as Streep put it last week, it's "more exotic to the rest of America than it is to the rest of the world."
Reason 3: As the I.O.C. evaluation committee chairwoman Nawal el-Moutawakel said last week, "We are against white elephants." In Sydney, Australia, and Athens, the Olympics left ghost towns of unusable stadiums behind in countries with only marginal interest in many Olympic sports. New York is the least narrow of all bidders, and many main sites -- like Madison Square Garden -- are already in place.
The West Side stadium, of course, is not one of them. Some support Shea Stadium as an option. After all, if NBC's camera tricks made it seem as if the Acropolis were floating above the suburban Olympic Stadium in Athens last summer, they could surely computer generate an image of Shea on the corner of Times Square.
But Shea renders the convention center plans dead -- and, thereby, doesn't help the city use the Olympics to generate future income to cover it costs.
Even so, if you choose, discard all the logic and hullabaloo about the Olympics, but remember: To oppose the West Side stadium is not a failure of Olympic optimism, but a failure of New Yorker cynicism. After all, what could be worse than a West Side stadium? Pick your monster: as is, as could be, as feared or as likely.
Sports of The Times E-mail: selenasports@nytimes.com
Sir Howard Stringer was in Los Angeles late last month, shuttling among the weekend's pre-Oscar parties given by the likes of Barry Diller, the Hollywood mogul turned Internet commerce magnate, when his cellphone rang.
Nobuyuki Idei, Sony's chairman and chief executive and Sir Howard's boss, was calling from Japan with some startling news to share: Sir Howard, chairman and chief executive of the United States unit of the Sony Corporation, was almost certainly to become Mr. Idei's successor, according to people closely involved in the succession plan.
The final choice had pitted Sir Howard, 63, a former television news producer and executive, and for the last eight years, overseer of Sony's music, movie and electronics divisions in the United States, against Ken Kutaragi, an executive deputy president considered the company's chief visionary. It was Mr. Kutaragi, 54, who built Sony's PlayStation video game unit into a roaring success.
By choosing Sir Howard, Sony gave the triumph to the diplomat over the technocrat, the sophisticated corporate manager rather than the brilliant but less polished Mr. Kutargi.
The groundbreaking Japanese technology and entertainment company had stumbled financially and technologically in recent years partly because of divisions between its engineering and its entertainment units. It needed someone to pull its parts together so that it did not lose more ground to relative newcomers in consumer electronics like Apple Computer and its iPod, or the rapidly growing electronics manufacturers in South Korea and China that are combining next-generation flat-panel television and superclean chip-making operations at lower cost.
So, after a weeklong series of discussions in Tokyo to determine the new management structure, Mr. Idei made one more call, this time to Sir Howard last Friday night at his English manor house in Oxfordshire. Sir Howard was told he needed to be in Tokyo for the announcement yesterday that he would be named the first non-Japanese chief executive at Sony in its 59 years.
A limber corporate politician, Sir Howard has a knack for winning trust and respect even when delivering bad news. His reputation, for instance, survived the layoffs of hundreds at CBS News. And that image has served him well in a country like Japan and a company like Sony, known for their consensual culture and where the in-your-face corporate politics of American business is rarely welcome.
"He can explain each side to the other," said Dan Rather, anchor and managing editor of the "CBS Evening News," a former colleague and a friend who has known him for more than 35 years. "Howard is a marvelous translator."
At a news conference yesterday, Sir Howard outlined his vision for the company. "We would accelerate cross-company collaboration," he said, "thereby revitalizing the company and promoting creativity. Growth cannot be achieved just through cost reduction. We need new projects, new ideas, new strategies, new alliances and a shared vision. All of our managers must have the authority and the will to manage."
That soothing language seemed to satisfy even Mr. Kutaragi. Despite losing the battle to Sir Howard, he seems to have been persuaded to accept a lesser role at the company for now, returning to the game unit to take charge of finishing development of the successor to PlayStation 2. Mr. Kutaragi, company insiders said, is still young enough to ultimately emerge as Sir Howard's successor.
Sir Howard -- hired by Mr. Idei in 1997, when Sony was trying to recover from debacles at its Columbia Pictures unit -- at first was in charge only of an odd mix of properties that included movie theaters and a shopping mall. But soon he was handed the American electronics division, then movies and music.
He strengthened relations with Mr. Idei by inviting him to events like the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, and to small dinner parties he held in New York. He speaks little Japanese, but Sir Howard -- a native of Wales, graduate of Oxford, Vietnam war veteran, producer of the "Evening News" with Mr. Rather and chief of all of CBS -- can bond with almost anyone, according to friends and colleagues.
"In my view, he was Idei's confidant in whatever degree you can become Idei's confidant," said John Calley, a former head of Sony Pictures Entertainment, who reported directly to headquarters in Tokyo before Sir Howard arrived at Sony. "He's the only one I know of who can manage the Japanese and the show-bizzers."
Sir Howard's Hollywood schmoozing skills were on display at the end of last month. Although he did not attend the Academy Awards, he made time for the parties that dot the Hollywood landscape before and after.
And on the way to the annual festivities presided over by Bryan Lourd of Creative Artists Agency and Ed Limato of International Creative Management, he had the limousine rented by Mr. Calley for the occasion pick up Diane English, the creator of "Murphy Brown" -- a hit at CBS when Sir Howard was there and who is now writing a screenplay for Sony.
"He's friends with most of the major stars," Mr. Calley said.
But financial results played what is probably a more important role in assuring Sir Howard's rise at Sony. During the fourth quarter of 2004, Sony's movie business accounted for 13 percent ($178 million) of Sony's operating profit, though it is a relatively small piece of the company's overall operations. While the turnaround of the American operations is not yet complete, the merged music division's gains have come in large part from cost-cutting measures.
Sony's American division is performing much better than its Japanese counterparts. Last quarter, for example, Sony's electronics business, though responsible for around 70 percent of revenue, brought in just 36 percent of its operating income. And for the fiscal year ending on March 31, Sony expects an overall operating profit margin of just 1.5 percent.
"Talk about trust; he doesn't have to earn it," Mr. Calley said. "He has it. And he's not going to lose it."
Sir Howard's adeptness at corporate politics, his friends and colleagues say, should prevent that from happening. "He has an excellent nostril for where the power is, where the power really lies, not where it looks like it is," said Mr. Rather, noting Sir Howard's "almost coyote-like ability to recognize who is on the come, who's going to be potent."
For example, Mr. Rather said, when Laurence A. Tisch began buying up shares of CBS through his family's Loews Corporation in the middle 1980's, Sir Howard recognized that Mr. Tisch was the power player and that Jay Kriegel was his confidant and trusted associate. When Mr. Tisch became the white knight against hostile takeover attempts and eventually chief executive, Sir Howard was well situated to prosper from the shift.
"People in news are usually tone-deaf to these things," Mr. Rather said. "Howard is definitely not tone-deaf."
With his sensitive antennas, Sir Howard, along with other executives, had heard the buzz of coming corporate changes in Tokyo. As a result, he was not completely surprised when in January Mr. Idei encouraged him to be provocative in his speech at a quarterly management conference, according to someone at the meeting who talked to Sir Howard.
In the speech, Sir Howard warned that Sony had to beware of becoming top heavy, to avoid looking like a mushroom, where the senior management layers threaten to overpower and strangle the creativity of the engineers and the products they create.
He pointed to examples in the United States, where moves like the introduction of shared back-office services across three operating companies (music, movies and electronics) cut about $700 million from the budget (and 9,000 of the 30,000 employees).
A combination of these cuts and other restructuring efforts also did away with much of the intradivision politicking at the electronics unit, which is now the most profitable of Sony electronics companies.
And in words signaling that the rest of Sony could be in for more such restructuring, Sir Howard told those in attendance that they could also achieve such results if they could withstand the pain of layoffs.
The $284 billion highway spending bill passed last week by the House includes a provision for $2.5 million in road construction that would aid Donald Trump's long-held goal of burying part of the West Side Highway near 61st Street, in front of his Trump Place development. Burying that section would add park space and provide better views from Trump Place apartments that overlook the Hudson River.

To travel with Theodore Roosevelt was to travel in a carnival led by a conjurer and trailed by an idolatrous throng. People were drawn by his energy and joy, qualities he possessed in quantities rarely found in persons over the age of eight. They wished for his courage, and if they did not always admire his pugnacity, they forgave it, for what was pugnacity but courage overspilling its banks? A conjurer beguiles by seeming guileless, and over the next three months Roosevelt would present himself as a former statesman on a grand tour, peregrinating from palace to palace, orating, collecting honors. Although few in Washington were deceived, the conjurer kept up the illusion, hoping, perhaps, to beguile himself. 
TR and Kermit had planned to dress up for their reunion with Edith and Ethel in Khartoum on March 14, but a mix-up with luggage forced TR into a stained shirt of gray flannel and a khaki suit impervious to beautification after a year in the bush. Junior Bwana, the dandy, hid his dishevelment under a duster. 
To Edith they looked splendid. Theodore had shed "that look of worry and care," she thought, and Kermit, although still "of the hatpin type," had gained muscle. He had also sprouted a wispy mustache. 
Would she like him to shave it off? he asked. 
She said it was lovely. 
In a hail of kisses from Theodore, Edith announced that their son Ted, twenty-two, was engaged. When Ethel told her father that Ted's fiancée, Eleanor Butler Alexander, would remind him of Edith, TR wrote her a welcoming letter and sent his congratulations to Ted. 
Pledged to silence on American politics, Roosevelt uncaged his political energies on behalf of British imperialism. The petty warlords who long tyrannized Egypt and Sudan had been subdued by the English, but the natives were calling for independence, and an extremist in their number had just assassinated Egypt's prime minister for supporting new censorship rules imposed by the British. After only a day with his official hosts in Khartoum, the Colonel agreed to lecture the native officers on their duty to uphold British law. The Sudanese immediately protested, and the Colonel immediately returned their fire. Britain's successes in the region resembled his own struggle to build the Panama Canal, he said. Victory had come from standing fast in a barrage. In blood and pounds sterling, the price of pacifying the region had been immense, and Britain should resist the pressure to set a date for independence: "you are really ruling the country now and ruling it for its good, using Egyptians and Sudanese as your instrumentalities. You must indeed have a genius for government when you can so well manage a strange people like these." 
The speeches in Sudan pleased his English friends, angered the natives, and signaled his return to the political stage. By lecturing other governments, the conjurer pulled off the neat trick of keeping himself in the news while honoring his promise not to comment on American affairs. On March 20 he announced that the speech he planned to make when he landed in New York in June would neither praise nor criticize the administration of William Howard Taft. There was no need for TR to announce the speech, much less to characterize it, and the promise of neutrality was a veiled insult: withholding support from his chosen successor was tantamount to attacking him. Roosevelt was drawing a line between Taft and himself, drawing it publicly, and drawing it less than a week after emerging from his safari. 
The Colonel's utterances in Khartoum preceded him to Cairo, where they were received as an affront to the aspirations of the Egyptian people. Anxious British officials put Roosevelt in a cocoon of bodyguards and asked him not to mention the assassination when he spoke at Cairo University. He refused. Everyone was thinking about the slaying, and if he did not speak of it, he would be branded a coward, he said. This Theodore Roosevelt, an English newspaper declared, had "a propensity to put himself into the thick of things." 
The speech proved to be little more than a compendium of bland preachments on goodness until the end, when he condemned the assassination and declared that preparation for successful self-government was the work "not of a decade or two but of generations." He shot his point home with an Arab proverb: "God is with the patient, if they know how to wait." 
For two days students shouting "Down with autocracy!" marched in the streets near Shepheard's Hotel, where the Roosevelts were lodged. The protesters resented his assumption that everyone who favored independence approved of the assassination, and they were appalled by his suggestion that Egypt, progenitor of Western civilization, was unprepared to govern itself. Colonel Roosevelt, said one of his Egyptian critics, knew no more about the region than a tourist and had been "deceived by bad company, such as is always the curse of great men." 
The second most interesting American at Shepheard's Hotel was Oscar Straus, ambassador to Turkey. The first Jew to hold a cabinet post, Straus had been appointed by Roosevelt to serve as secretary of commerce and labor. He had come to Cairo to talk politics and to show Roosevelt a sober, unsettling editorial in the North American Review. The voters of the United States had been hoodwinked, the Review said. They had "accepted Mr. Taft at Mr. Roosevelt's word" and expected him to stay the progressive course, but Mr. Taft's first year showed that Mr. Roosevelt's word had been broken, his judgment misplaced. 
To progressives, it seemed that the new president had tacked hard to the political right. He had fired Gifford Pinchot, replaced Henry White, and gutted the cabinet after telling Roosevelt that he hoped Straus and several others would stay on. Taft had asked Roosevelt to let the cabinet members know of his wishes, and when Roosevelt asked why he did not tell them himself, Taft said he wanted them to know of his wishes but thought it best not to make promises. 
That was Roosevelt's version of events, recounted several years after the fact. Taft left two versions, and in the one that found its way to biographers and historians - a letter written just before the inauguration to William Rockhill Nelson, publisher of the Kansas City Star - Taft said he had decided to fill his cabinet with lawyers. Roosevelt's administration had created a public demand for reform on several fronts, and Taft proposed to meet it by amending the relevant statutes. "The people who are fitted to do this, without injury to the business interests of the country, are those lawyers who understand corporate wealth, the present combination, its evils, and the methods by which they can be properly restrained," he told Nelson. Most of the new cabinet secretaries were honorable men, but they were also laissez-faire men, men from the grand duchies of American capitalism. Although Taft sensed that his choices would be sharply criticized, he believed he could accomplish more with the help of "conservative men who know what they are talking about" than with progressives clamoring for greater reform. "With more radical men I should split the party and do nothing," he said. 
A year later, aware that Roosevelt felt betrayed by the cabinet purge, Taft angrily defended himself in a private talk with two reporters. He was the one who had been betrayed, he said. "Mr. Roosevelt told me that he would make absolutely no suggestion to me, but I told him that I did not want to be deprived of the privilege of consulting him. Notwithstanding his declaration of neutrality, Mr. Roosevelt did take great interest in the selections, and, although, perhaps, he made no out-and-out request of me, I didn't have to be hit with a club ten times a day to understand the workings of his mind." 
Watching the new cabinet take shape and hearing about it from the Roosevelt loyalists who gathered at his home, Henry Adams had reported to a friend that Taft was starting out with "a series of what the French call bêtises, stupidities which have thrown me into consternation." Adams said he might be wrong about Taft, but if so, "I am mistaken in company with everyone else. I am only an echo of underground society.... I have no candidates to offer, and no scheme to suggest; but if the new president is so bent on making a clean sweep of Roosevelt's men, why did we elect him expressly to carry on the Roosevelt regime?" 
While Roosevelt was on safari, Taft had bungled his chance to lead Congress through a sorely needed economic reform. The Dingley Tariff, enacted in 1897 to protect American manufacturers from competition with foreign producers who could undersell them, created big profits for industry but high prices for consumers. The tariff had passed when the Northeast's senators and congressmen, captives of the factory owners, persuaded their fellow lawmakers that it would also protect the high wages of American workers. It did, but only momentarily: between 1897 and 1909, prices rose 50 percent faster than wages. 
After expeditiously making good on a campaign pledge to call a special session of Congress for tariff reform, Taft stood by while the high-tariff men merrily reshuffled their stacked deck. He did not want to antagonize either the progressive or the conservative wing of the Republican Party, he explained. Early on, Taft suspected that the conservative legislators' promise of substantive tariff reform might be insincere, but he did nothing to hold them to their word, and rather than veto the bill, he settled for a few trivial alterations, then pronounced it "the best bill that the Republican Party ever passed." 
Taft loathed conflict of all sorts and frequently absented himself from the White House for long periods, crisscrossing the country and setting a presidential record for railroad travel - 28,000 miles during his first year in office. He wanted to be the president of all the people and learn their views firsthand, he said, but the public began wondering if he was doing his job. Republicans in Congress complained about his inaccessibility, and when Democrats saw that he had overspent his travel allowance, they threatened to eliminate it from the next budget. Taft ignored the complaints. The trips were relaxing, and away from his wife, who fretted about his ever-increasing weight, he could eat without restraint. He now weighed 330 pounds. 
Singularly deaf to the voice of the people, Taft pouted at their angry reaction to the revised tariff, while they in turn gaped at the changeling they had put in the White House. Before his nomination, "Taft always insisted he had no qualifications for the job," William Rockhill Nelson wrote TR in the spring of 1910. "We thought differently. But he was right and we were wrong.... The president must carry a big stick and be ready to fight. But when you come to think of it, you never saw Taft fighting with his nose all bloody and one eye hanging down on his cheek, and his front teeth knocked out." 
The White House press corps, which Roosevelt had charmed and used to great effect, was a nuisance to Taft. "Must I see those men again?" he once whined to his secretary. "Didn't I just see them the other day?" Cut off from Taft, the newsmen cultivated other sources, many of them critical of his administration. The newspapers had treated Taft "with the greatest gentleness," Nelson told TR. "But he thinks he has been very badly treated and goes about sobbing over it publicly. A crybaby won't do." 
Failed presidents attract few biographers, and the handful who have dissected Taft in search of explanations for his dismal presidential performance have wondered in exasperation how Roosevelt ever could have considered him fit for the presidency. Taft was indolent, irresolute, dependent, and undone by opposition and criticism - a dooming combination. But the Taft that Roosevelt knew had distinguished himself as governor-general of the Philippines, problem-solver in Cuba and Panama, and secretary of war. Under Roosevelt's energetic leadership, Taft kept his lassitude in check, and his other shortcomings easily could have manifested themselves as virtues. A dependent man makes an excellent lieutenant, for he is happiest when carrying out the orders of others. And a man who shies away from conflict can be an exceptionally agreeable colleague. TR thought his friend Will had "the most loveable personality" of anyone he had ever known. 
Transfixed by Taft's deficiencies and Roosevelt's misjudgment, biographers have not probed the deeper question of what happened to Taft between his decades of success and his sudden, total failure. Taft was a man who thrived by anchoring himself to intimates and striving to please them by doing what they thought best, and in the standard telling of the tale, Taft's course had been set by a voracious, controlling wife who pushed him toward the presidency to gratify her own ambitions. Helen Herron Taft ("Nellie" among family and friends) had yearned to be first lady since a girlhood stay in the White House of President Rutherford B. Hayes. She had grown up in comfortable circumstances in Cincinnati, studied chemistry and German at Miami University in Ohio, and taught school after graduating from college. Born a century too soon for a career of her own, she put her energy and intelligence into the rise of William Howard Taft. 
Nellie's efforts were fully supported by his mother and his three brothers. Will's only ambition was to be chief justice of the Supreme Court, but the family often discussed their presidential aspirations for him. When Roosevelt offered him a seat on the court in 1902, his brother Charles encouraged him to take it but not to feel obliged to honor the custom of staying for life. His mother urged him to hold out for chief justice. Associate justices were poorly paid, and at forty-six he was too young for such an inactive life, she wrote him. "I would rather see you fighting corruption in the Senate, or winning prizes in the open arena at the Bar." 
As early as 1903 Roosevelt began encouraging Taft to consider the presidency, and three years later, when they had their first serious talk about it, the possibility seemed so fantastical to Taft that he reported the conversation to Nellie as if he were awaiting orders from her or TR: "He wants to talk to you and me together. He thinks I am the one to take his mantle and that now I could be nominated." 
Taft was not Roosevelt's first choice. TR considered Elihu Root more qualified, but Root was too closely identified with Wall Street to appeal to the country as a whole, and the asperity of his wit intimidated all but a hardy few. Continues...
WHEN TRUMPETS CALL Theodore Roosevelt After the White House. By Patricia O'Toole. Illustrated. 494 pp. Simon & Schuster. $30.
"THE American presidency," John Updike once wrote, "is merely a way station en route to the blessed condition of being an ex-president." Taking the other side of the argument -- emphatically so -- is Theodore Roosevelt. In 1917, eight years out of office, he delivered this verdict: "I am having a horrid, unimportant time."
Horrid, perhaps; unimportant, unlikely. As an ex-president, as in many things, Theodore Roosevelt remains without peer. Among the living, Jimmy Carter has made a meaningful career since leaving the White House and Bill Clinton has begun one; Gerald Ford and George H. W. Bush have displayed more modest ambitions.
Over the past century only Theodore Roosevelt -- living in a time before term limits -- took another shot at the top job and, failing in that, made a national nuisance, spectacle and hero of himself, all at once. His post-White House period is in some ways more riveting than his presidency, in the sense that a lion is more riveting when out of its cage. A few years ago, when the biographer Edmund Morris published his second volume on Roosevelt, covering the White House years, more than one reviewer looked ahead longingly to Volume 3.
Patricia O'Toole, the author of a book on Henry Adams and his circle, has beaten Morris to the punch. "When Trumpets Call" carries Roosevelt from the end of his presidency to the end of his life -- a mere 10 years, which pass like a blur. At no point does he look like a man in retirement. There is but one mention of golf here, and it refers not to Roosevelt but to his feckless successor, William Howard Taft, who, on hearing of T.R.'s latest affront, hurls a golf club 25 yards.
"When I am through with anything," Roosevelt told his close friend Senator Henry Cabot Lodge, "I am through with it." Only weeks after exiting the White House, he left the United States -- partly to give Taft, his handpicked replacement, the run of the place, partly, as O'Toole puts it, as an "antidote to . . . ennui." Away in Africa for nearly a year, he consoled himself by killing lions, collecting zoological specimens and visiting friends.
But trumpets sound, and while on safari Roosevelt is already giving thought to unseating Taft, who had pledged to continue Roosevelt's reforms but instead drifted rightward. Roosevelt was bitter at the betrayal.
By 1910, he was in revolt. Roosevelt lashed Taft before fervent crowds of Republican progressives. The New Nationalism he espoused was scarcely different from the policies he had pursued as president, but the fire in his eyes gave his moderate agenda a militant air.
O'Toole, a skilled storyteller, deftly handles the Roosevelt-Taft dissolution: the cheap insults, the false starts at reconciliation and, finally, the contest for the White House in 1912. After humiliating Taft in the primaries, Roosevelt was denied the nomination by Republican power brokers. Reincarnated as a "Bull Moose," he ran for president on the Progressive ticket, splitting the Republican Party and giving the election to Woodrow Wilson.
That O'Toole adds little to our understanding of these events may not be a fair test: the 1912 election is one of the most consequential, and therefore most examined, in American history. O'Toole imbues the familiar story with a feeling of inevitability -- the failure of Roosevelt's attempt at restoration and his resulting slide into "impotent rage" (his own assessment). "The election," she writes, "left Roosevelt politically dead yet unable to rest in peace."
While President Wilson grabbed progressive glory, Roosevelt was left to referee squabbles within his new party and to pick meaningless fights with painters, zoologists, all comers -- often in print. In Oyster Bay and abroad he tried, as O'Toole puts it, "to bluff himself into contentment." But even he wasn't buying.
In his last major speech of the 1912 campaign, Roosevelt had warned not to "permit the brutal selfishness of arrogance and the brutal selfishness of envy each to run unchecked its evil course," lest "smoldering hatred . . . kindle into a consuming flame." He meant his advice for the nation but would have done well to heed it himself. Envy and regret curdled him; contempt clouded his judgment. He became a magnet for malcontents who often encouraged his worst instincts.
During his years as president, Roosevelt had nothing but loathing for critics, but now he had become the critic in chief. It was a role he played wrathfully and at high pitch. When the war in Europe intensified in 1915, he issued a shrill call for the United States to mobilize. His belligerency was out of step with the Republican Party, to which he had returned; with the Wilson administration, which he reviled; and with popular opinion. But he was vindicated by events. By the time of his death (of an embolism, at the age of 60, in January 1919), he appeared a prophet to many, and had become the Republicans' leading contender for the 1920 nomination.
"When Trumpets Call" is a parable of powerlessness. Roosevelt, O'Toole concludes, "seems never to have grasped the immensity of his need for power, and after his years in the White House would often mistake the call of personal ambition for a call to serve his country." This appraisal, though, could apply to nearly anyone who has ever held public office. Too often, O'Toole's analysis cuts no deeper than this, leaving the reader craving complexity. Roosevelt may have lived in bold strokes, but an accurate portrait requires finer shadings.
What his final decade reveals -- and O'Toole mostly overlooks -- is how powerlessness became, for Roosevelt, more corrosive, more soul-polluting, than power. Out of office he inverted the cliché that power corrupts, abandoning, in large portions, the restraint, equanimity and even wisdom he had displayed as president. T.R. unbound was T.R. unmoored.
Jeff Shesol is the author of "Mutual Contempt: Lyndon Johnson, Robert Kennedy and the Feud That Defined a Decade."
The United States Congress and the governor of Florida have devoted extraordinary and all but single-minded energy to keeping Terri Schiavo alive. But all they have achieved so far is a bitter lesson in judicial supremacy.
It is a lesson as old as Marbury v. Madison, the 1803 case in which Chief Justice John Marshall famously said that "it is emphatically the province and duty of the judicial department to say what the law is," and as fresh as Bush v. Gore, the 2000 decision that decided a presidential election.
Its latest teachers were Judge George W. Greer, of the Pinellas-Pasco Circuit Court in Clearwater, Fla., and the federal appeals court in Atlanta.
Judge Greer blocked Gov. Jeb Bush from following through on a suggestion at a news conference that state officials might take Ms. Schiavo into protective custody. And, even as he agreed to consider overnight what state officials called new evidence that she might be conscious, Judge Greer staked out a primary role in the process.
A lawyer for the state told the judge that the three branches of the government are equal.
"That is indeed true," Judge Greer replied, "but the executive is certainly not superior."
And the United States Court of Appeals for the 11th Circuit, in Atlanta, in successive decisions yesterday of a three-judge panel and then the entire 12-member court, refused to order Ms. Schiavo's feeding tube to be reinserted notwithstanding a law enacted by Congress on Monday that many of its supporters thought required at least that.
If nothing else, this series of decisions vindicated the one conception of American judicial power.
"It has been the basic premise of the three-branch system set up by the Constitution," said Eric M. Freedman, a law professor at Hofstra, "that judgments in individual cases are to be made by judges and not legislative bodies or executive officials. That division, which originated from unhappy experience in England, has been a valuable protection of liberty in this country over many centuries."
The decisions also illustrate how protective the judiciary branch can be of its status in a divided government.
"Judges don't like to be fooled around with," said Mark Tushnet, a law professor at Georgetown. "If executive officials or legislators do something that judges think look as if they're being fooled around with, they will be extremely resistant."
And judges often protect their own.
The federal judges whom Congress authorized to rehear the Schiavo case seemed reluctant to upset what their state-court colleagues had decided.
In his decision refusing to reinsert the feeding tube on Tuesday, Judge James D. Whittemore, of the Federal District Court in Tampa, expressed solicitude for Judge Greer, saying that accusations that he had acted in a biased and unlawful fashion were "without merit."
At the same time, he explained to Congress and to Ms. Schiavo's parents that the new law did not require him to preserve Ms. Schiavo's life. Her parents had not demonstrated, he said, the only thing that mattered in court: a substantial likelihood that they would succeed on the merits of their case.
The divided three-judge panel that upheld Judge Whittemore's decision, in turn, went out of its way to praise his work as "carefully thought out" and took the relatively unusual step of appending it to the majority decision.
In almost the same breath, the two judges who joined the unsigned majority opinion, Ed Carnes and Frank M. Hull, said the law enacted on Monday could not undo years of litigation in the Florida state courts. And in what could be read as a dig at Congress, the judges suggested that better drafting might have yielded a different result.
"Congress considered and specifically rejected provisions that would have mandated, or permitted with favorable implications, the grant of the pretrial stay," the majority said.
An early version of the legislation passed on Monday said that the district judge hearing the Schiavo case "shall" issue a stay of the state court proceedings. A later one said it "may" issue such a stay. The law as enacted omitted the provision entirely.
Yesterday's panel decision quoted at length and with something like glee from an exchange between Senator Carl Levin, Democrat of Michigan, and the Senate majority leader, Bill Frist, Republican of Tennessee.
Senator Levin asked Senator Frist about the significance of the omitted stay provision.
"Nothing in the current bill or its legislative history mandates a stay," Senator Frist replied. "I would assume, however, the federal court would grant a stay based on the facts of this case because Mrs. Schiavo would need to be alive in order for the court to make its determination."
Dr. Frist assumed wrong, the majority suggested. Indeed, the music of the panel decision was that Congress could not win. Had it passed the earlier version of the law, the courts might well have held it unconstitutional. The version Congress did pass, the panel majority said yesterday, was ineffective.
In the afternoon, the full 12-member appeals court declined to hear the case, with two judges publishing dissents.
By yesterday afternoon, both the White House and the Florida Legislature had cried uncle. Governor Bush, however, indicated he was prepared to fight on. Whether he prevails seems to depend on Judge Greer.
Professor Tushnet said that demonstrated how much power judges wield in the American system. "You can mess with Mother Nature," he said, "but it's really hard to do effectively. Mother Nature has a lot of tools at her disposal. So do judges."
Erwin Chemerinsky, a law professor at Duke University, said no one should take pleasure in these clashes. Just as hard cases make bad law, he said, "tragic cases make bad law."
The torrent of words that constitutes "Eyewitness Blues," a free-form dissertation on artistic creativity that opened this week at New York Theater Workshop, is delivered with such verve that it's easy to go into passive-absorption mode: just let the thing pummel you, and leave feeling that you must have been entertained in the process. But listen closely and you begin to suspect that this innovative-sounding barrage includes more than its share of clichés.
The piece, written and performed by Mildred Ruiz and Steven Sapp of the ensemble Universes, revolves around a trumpet player named Junior (Mr. Sapp) and his inner struggles. Ms. Ruiz is Muse, an amorphous character who tries to draw him out and force him to face his demons. Mr. Sapp is absolutely magnetic, and sometimes the writing is too:
Let me be the nightmare you've always wanted
Slippery
Scary
Sexy
Just enough but not too much.
Other times, though, the script traffics in exhausted mantras and the type of name-dropping (Hendrix, Miles, Monk, Billie, Wynton) that is supposed to sound savvy and semi-sacred but is actually just lazy. There is a kitchen-sink quality to the proceedings as well: this tormented trumpeter talks of drugs and graffiti and Bloods and Crips and practically any other urban malady you can name. And the ultimate source of his discontent? When in doubt, blame Vietnam.
So "Eyewitness Blues," while always passionate, is only intermittently persuasive, perhaps because the underlying notion that all art must be born of trauma and anger is the biggest cliché of all.
"Eyewitness Blues" runs through April 10 at 79 East Fourth Street.
I have recently begun to wonder whether I am completely out of touch with the mainstream, and if so, what that implies.
When I was a young student it became clear to me that the remarkable success of the scientific method, which changed the world beyond belief in the four centuries since Galileo, made the power and efficacy of that method evident. Moreover, scientific ideas are not only powerful but so beautiful that they are on par with the most spectacular legacies of civilization in art, architecture, literature, music and philosophy.
This is what makes the current times so disconcerting. We like to think that spectacular intellectual developments bring progress, so that future generations may benefit from what has come before. But this is often an illusion.
I remember the shock wave generated four years ago when the Taliban government in Afghanistan destroyed thousands of statues, including two priceless and awe-inspiring archaeological artifacts, the world's largest standing statues of Buddha, created almost 2,000 years ago. The Taliban claimed that Islamic law prohibited the creation of idolatrous images of human faces that might be used for worship.
I remember sharing the feeling of incredible sadness to know that the world had forever lost a precious part of its intellectual heritage. It was difficult to believe that in the 21st century such a return to the dark ages could happen anywhere.
Those images came to mind again as I followed recent news of incidents in the United States in which fundamentalist dogma and its fear of the intellectual progress that comes from understanding nature has trumped the scientific method. These actions attack intellectual pillars of our civilization that are every bit as real as monumental statues of Buddha.
The "reality-based community," as one White House insider so poetically referred to it recently, is losing the fight for hearts and minds throughout the country to a well-orchestrated marketing program that plays on sentiment and fear.
The open intrusion of religious dogma into the highest levels of government is stunning. Justice Antonin Scalia of the Supreme Court speaks of "the fact that government derives its authority from God" (during oral arguments before the court about displays of the Ten Commandments) while the president of the United States has argued that evolution is a theory not a fact.
The effort to blur the huge distinction between faith and science, between empirically falsifiable facts and beliefs, was on display again this month in two very different contexts.
Congressional leaders ignored the conclusions of the doctors who have actually examined Terri Schiavo and judges who have listened to the evidence. Senator Bill Frist, previously a heart surgeon who must have once known better, shunned the conclusions of these doctors and, without ever having examined Ms. Schiavo himself, stated his "belief" that she was not in a vegetative state.
Meanwhile, on a much less emotionally tragic but no less intellectually puzzling front, the Templeton Foundation continued with its program to sponsor the notion that science can somehow ultimately reveal the existence of God by once again awarding its annual Templeton Prize for Progress in Religion not to a theologian, but to a physicist.
Dr. Charles Townes, the winner, is a Nobel laureate whose scientific work has been of impeccable distinction; his prime contribution to religion appears to be his proudly proclaiming his belief in God as revealed through the beauty of nature.
I confess that my immediate reaction was the same as it has been to all of Templeton's recent awards to scientists. If this is the most significant progress in religious thought, beating out the work of distinguished theologians throughout the world, then it is a sad reflection on such progress. Of course, I rather believe that it reflects on the foundation's misguided goals and methods.
Nature's beauty inspires religious fervor in some scientists. For others, like the Nobel laureate Dr. Steven Weinberg, it merely reinforces their belief that God is irrelevant.
The point here, which should be obvious, is that science and religion are separate entities: science is a predictive discipline based on empirically falsifiable facts; religion is a hopeful discipline based on inner faith.
Theologians as ancient as St. Augustine and Moses Maimonides recognized that science, not religion, was the appropriate and reliable method to try to understand the physical world. Yet it is precisely this ancient wisdom that is now under attack.
Foes of evolution and the Big Bang in this country do not operate with the direct and brutal actions of the Taliban. They have marketing skills. Openly condemning evolution as blasphemous might play well to the fundamentalist true believers, but it wouldn't play well in the heartland, which is the real target. Thus the spurious argument is created that evolution isn't good science.
This "fact" is established by fiat. The Discovery Institute in Seattle supports the work of several Ph.D.'s who then write books (and op-ed articles) decrying the fallacy of evolution. They don't write scientific articles, however, because the claims they make -- either that cellular structures are too complex to have evolved or that evolution itself is improbable -- have either failed to stand up to detailed scrutiny or involve no falsifiable predictions.
What is being obscured in this manufactured debate is that the underlying intent has little to do with evolution, or the age of the earth. The fundamentalist attack is on the basic premise that physical phenomena have physical causes that can be revealed by use of the scientific method.
Because science does not explicitly incorporate a deity in its considerations, some fundamentalists believe that it undermines our moral order, just as the Buddha statues presented a threat to the fundamentalist Islamic moral order.
The pillar of our humanity that is most under attack is our remarkable ability to understand nature. We claim that in places like Afghanistan the enemies of truth are the enemies of freedom and democracy. If the scientific method is out of the mainstream in our country it is time to take a stronger stand against the effort to undermine empirical reality in favor of dogma.
COMMENTARY Dr. Lawrence M. Krauss is chairman of the physics department at Case Western Reserve University. His new book, "Hiding in the Mirror," will appear this fall.
A federal judge yesterday approved a plan by Trump Hotels and Casino Resorts to exit bankruptcy. The plan gives the chairman, Donald J. Trump, a 30 percent stake in the reorganized company and reduces its debt to $1.25 billion.
The company resolved shareholders' objections to its plan last week by agreeing to give them $17.5 million and proceeds from the sale of the former site of the World's Fair casino in Atlantic City, where the company is based.
Judge Judith H. Wizmur of United States Bankruptcy Court approved the plan at a hearing in Camden, N.J. The company expects to exit bankruptcy in May.
Trump Hotels, which owns four casino hotels, filed for bankruptcy protection in November after negotiating a plan with bondholders to restructure more than $1.8 billion in debt. The filing was the second casino bankruptcy for Mr. Trump.
Under the plan, Mr. Trump receives his ownership stake in exchange for a personal investment of $55 million and a contribution of about $16.4 million in notes. He currently holds a 56 percent stake in Trump Hotels.
Mr. Trump would also get stock options and a 25 percent stake in the Miss Universe pageant valued at $5 million.
Bondholders would swap their debt for cash, most of the stock in the revamped company and new notes. The plan estimates they would get at least 93 percent of what they are owed.
Just a couple of months ago, he heard the most freighted words on network television rain down on him: "You're fired!"
Now, not only is Brian McDowell in a business relationship with Trump Marina, one of the Atlantic City properties of Donald Trump, the man who fired him on "The Apprentice," but he is using his fame to try to forge a political career.
Mr. McDowell was a member of the Street Smarts team playing on the current version of "The Apprentice," where contestants vie to be hired by Donald Trump. The losers are impaled by his trademark phrase.
Mr. McDowell, a 29-year-old real estate broker from North Wildwood, is the only Jersey Shore resident to be a contestant on the show so far. He spent seven weeks in Manhattan working on a business plan with the other Street Smarts members (all of them had built businesses on their own) against a team of brainy business-school types.
Last week, though, Mr. McDowell declared himself a Democratic candidate for the council in North Wildwood. Though registration runs more than four-to-one in favor of Republicans in the Cape May County Shore town, Mr. McDowell sounded fearless about his prospects in November. "A million people want to be on 'The Apprentice,' and I beat those odds," he said. "I'm hoping that people will look beyond the party and see that I want to do good for everyone in town here. I want to beat these odds, too, but if I don't I still think it will be a good experience."
Meanwhile, Mr. McDowell, through his "Apprentice" contacts, is working with Trump Marina to give away a $1 million house -- the particular house remains unidentified -- through his real estate business.
"I would have never been in the position to do something like this if I weren't on the show, even though I was the second person fired," he said. "So I don't think getting kicked off early was such a bad experience. You use whatever you can to your advantage and everyone wins." Robert Strauss

Mark Morris doesn't fight music, and for that deceptively simple approach to his art, he is equally adored and reviled. But his musical candor is usually delightful: Mr. Morris breathes life into complicated scores with an earthy movement palette and unaffected dancers, who are as individual onstage as they must be in life. For his annual season at Brooklyn Academy of Music, which opened on Tuesday night, he presents the New York premiere of "Rock of Ages," a rambunctious title for such an elegant triumph of a dance.
Set to Schubert's haunting Adagio in E flat, "Rock of Ages" is a subdued quartet that packs a wallop, in the same manner as Mr. Morris's wondrously minimal "Foursome" from 2002. Joe Bowie, Amber Darragh, David Leventhal and Julie Worden wore Katherine McDowell's uncomplicated short-sleeved tops and skirts or pants in shades of azure and green. (The cast will be different each night.) 
"Rock of Ages" begins with the dancers walking to the center of the stage before separating into twos and threes. Certain gestural motifs come up again and again. Dancers grasp their hands behind their backs in a fist, subtlety shifting their shoulders to reveal their profiles. They swirl their arms elaborately or stab their feet on the floor with emphatic punctuation. Mirroring the mysterious music without mimicking it, Mr. Morris repeatedly builds upon his vibrant movement before pulling back to create a landscape of quiet elasticity. 
The program also includes "From Old Seville," a boisterous work set to Manuel Requiebros's "A Esa Mujer." Mr. Morris, both burly and lithe, joins Lauren Grant, a tiny, feisty performer, in a string of flamenco dances, full of castanets and sharp footwork. In between, they share a bottle of wine. Of course it's funny, but Mr. Morris's voluptuous attack and phrasing are astonishing; the more wine he soaks up, the more refined he becomes.
In "Somebody's Coming to See Me Tonight," an evocative dance for nine from 1995, Mr. Morris provides an unsentimental frame for Stephen Foster's romantic songs. A couple sweeps along in "The Hour for Thee and Me," only to have one dancer run offstage, replaced by another in sweeping relay-race fashion. As the numbers unfold, it becomes apparent that the work is not about romance, but the edge of death. 
"Silhouettes," a duet from 1999, pairs Ms. Grant, in silky pajama bottoms and a black bra, with Ms. Worden, in the pajama top and only a pair of briefs. Richard Cumming's "Silhouettes - Five Pieces for Piano" is the sprightly music to which they perform sparkling ballet steps, twisting and turning in the air with luxurious resilience. 
Mr. Morris concludes his program with the dense 45-minute "Rhymes With Silver" (1997), set to a 13-part score by Lou Harrison. This grand work for 16 is set against Howard Hodgkin's striking painting of wavy red-and-lime lines.
"Rhymes With Silver" is truly handsome and taps into many styles of movement; the dancers, both in unison and in a staggered arrangement, propel their bodies into bold, geometric shapes. The influences come from everywhere, including a hint of folk dancing and a waltz, which features June Omura partnering 14 bodies in a row. But the choreography is not random. 
Bradon McDonald, taking over the wild-child role that Mr. Morris originally made for himself, is bewitching, from the way his strawberry-blond curls bounce with fervor to the untamed manner in which he prances on the stage, throwing his arms up and down. Whenever Mr. Morris stepped onstage in 1997, the audience was compelled to roar with laughter. But with Mr. McDonald's spooky presence, the dance is the star. "Rhymes With Silver" is a beautiful design that lingers near joy and pathos, but never quite makes it to either. Despite its length, it leaves you aching for more. 
The company performs Thursday through Saturday at the Brooklyn Academy of Music, 30 Lafayette Avenue, at Ashland Place, Fort Greene, (718) 636-4100.
After six weeks, 50 Cent has finally been unseated from the top of the Billboard album charts by Mariah Carey, whose eighth studio album, "The Emancipation of Mimi" (Island), left, sold 404,000 copies, according to Nielsen SoundScan. It was the best opening sales week of Ms. Carey's career, and her first time at No.1 in eight years, Billboard reported. This week's chart features two other notable debuts: Mudvayne's "Lost and Found" (Epic) opened at No.2 with sales of 152,000, and Garbage's "Bleed Like Me" (Geffen) is at No.4. 50 Cent's "Massacre" (Interscope) dropped to No.3, with sales of 140,000. Down the chart, Green Day continues to hold strong with "American Idiot" (Reprise), which sold 57,000 copies and is now in its 30th week in the Top 10, at No.8, and the Killers have moved up one spot to No.10, with 55,000 sales for "Hot Fuss" (Island). BEN SISARIO
Donald J. Trump, reality television star, fragrance entrepreneur and developer of tall buildings, revealed his answer to the problems at the World Trade Center site yesterday. That answer, perhaps unsurprising, was himself.
In a news conference at Trump Tower on Fifth Avenue, Mr. Trump stood before a large model of his vision for a new World Trade Center site, which included towers similar to the Twin Towers, and said that he would press government officials and private developers to rebuild more structurally sound versions of the fallen towers instead of the Freedom Tower, which has been sent back to the drawing board for a new design because of security concerns raised by the Police Department.
Mr. Trump's model was designed by his structural engineer, Kenneth Gardner, who quoted poetry at the news conference, apologized to his mother and thanked many people who "made this day possible."
Mr. Trump's comments about the Freedom Tower were not so appreciative. "In a nutshell," he said, "the Freedom Tower should not be allowed to be built. It's not appropriate for Lower Manhattan, it's not appropriate for Manhattan, it's not appropriate for the United States, it's not appropriate for freedom."
But Mr. Trump's proposal is not exactly appropriate for him. He said he would not be willing actually to lease space in the buildings. ("I only go in buildings I own.") Nor would he explain how his towers would be paid for. "Larry Silverstein hopefully can do this," Mr. Trump said, referring to the lead developer of the site. Mr. Silverstein plans to use insurance money from the terrorist attack to develop both the Freedom Tower and 7 World Trade.
Mr. Trump's plan was dismissed by the governmental agencies involved and raised the ire of some people who lost loved ones on Sept. 11. "If he has such grand ideas and imaginative thoughts," said Thomas Rogér, whose daughter Jean was a flight attendant on the plane that hit the north tower, "where was he three years ago when the master planning was going on?"
He called Mr. Trump's proposal and timing "in poor taste," and said they did not reflect the wishes of the majority of families. "The towers are not a memorial to the people who died there," he said. "If anything it is a bitter reminder of how people died."
Joanna Rose, the spokeswoman for the Lower Manhattan Development Corporation, said in an e-mail message: "Donald Trump is entitled to his opinion, just like the millions of people who actually involved themselves in the public planning process, which resulted in the master plan."
Mr. Trump's scorecard as a developer is mixed. After the city spent six years and $12 million in a failed effort to renovate the Wollman Memorial Rink in Central Park, he took over the project in 1986 and completed it ahead of schedule and under budget.
But other projects have fallen short or have been plagued with financial problems. He built the tallest residential building in the world on the East Side, but not, as once promised, "the tallest building in the world" on the West Side, nor the spaceship-shaped skyscraper he proposed for Columbus Circle, where the Time-Warner Center now stands.
Trump Hotels and Casino Resorts Inc. filed for bankruptcy protection in November under the weight of $1.8 billion in debt, the second casino bankruptcy for Mr. Trump. (The company has since emerged, with a new name and Mr. Trump's ownership stake reduced.)
It was clearly a coincidence that Mr. Trump held his news conference a day before the season finale of his network reality show, "The Apprentice." But he did mention that Gov. George E. Pataki had been on the show repeatedly, and said that his World Trade Center model, which he reported had moved tourists in the Trump Tower lobby to tears, might be featured on tonight's show.
Trump Hotels and Casino Resorts emerged from bankruptcy and changed its name to Trump Entertainment Resorts. Donald J. Trump, the company's chairman, said in a statement that he intended to hire a chief executive. Trump Entertainment owns the Trump Taj Mahal, the Trump Marina and the Trump Plaza casinos in Atlantic City and the Trump Casino Hotel in Gary, Ind. The company entered Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in November.
DID Bruce Wasserstein, Lazard's chief executive, outmaneuver Goldman Sachs?
It sure looks that way.
Last week, Goldman said in a filing that it was left with $15 million in losses after underwriting Lazard's initial public offering and trying in vain to prop up the stock as it began falling in the first days of trading.
Indeed, the much-heralded public offering has turned out to be an unmitigated fiasco -- for everybody but Mr. Wasserstein and Lazard. Investors who originally bought into the offering at $25 a share have quickly tallied up significant losses. The shares closed at $21.78 on Friday. Those investors have rightly turned around and accused Goldman of hyping the offering and foolishly distributing shares to a bevy of fast-money hedge funds that quickly flipped the stock, virtually ensuring that the price would tumble.
And then, of course, there is Mr. Wasserstein. He is sitting pretty, having pulled off his own Mission Impossible: By raising $854.6 million in equity and nearly an additional $1 billion in debt, he and Lazard's other bankers bought their freedom -- and control of the firm -- from its chairman and patriarch, Michel David-Weill.
How did Mr. Wasserstein get it so right and Goldman, Wall Street's favorite punching bag of late, get it so wrong? The offering is a case study in what happens when bankers encourage both their corporate clients and investors, a situation that doesn't help them make friends with either.
Lazard's offering went off the rails long before it began trading on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol LAZ. Under pressure from Lazard to get the highest possible price, Goldman set the original range between $25 and $27 a share. That was probably a bit too high, and that mistake was compounded when the final price had to be determined. Instead of lowering it to about $22 a share -- a price point some bankers internally championed because of weak demand -- Goldman decided to push for $25 a share, the minimum it had promised to Lazard and the amount required to allow Mr. Wasserstein to pay Mr. David-Weill.
While banks usually set the share price with input from their clients, this client was different: Lazard is an investment bank that had its own views.
To meet Lazard's demands, Goldman sold many of the shares to hedge funds with quick trigger fingers. That meant the moment the stock began trading, thousands of shares flooded the market. Hoping to blunt the selloff, Goldman stepped in, as underwriters often do, to try to establish a floor for the stock by buying up the shares itself.
According to the filing, Goldman had already accumulated 3.8 million shares, worth about $94 million, by the time stock dropped to $24.90. Goldman kept buying, at one point owning as much as 10 percent of Lazard, but it could not prevent the dam from bursting. Unwilling to take on even more risk, Goldman could not continue buying shares to stabilize the stock. But Goldman may not care so much about its trading losses. It split $42.7 million with six other firms for underwriting Lazard's offering.
Goldman proudly defends its failed buying spree by saying that it was going to bat for Lazard, but that is only half the story. Goldman was also buying to protect itself. Investors who had held on to their shares expecting them to go up -- as Goldman had led them to believe they would -- were livid.
Either way, Goldman does not come out of this one looking too good. If its explanation for buying the shares was really to help Lazard, that is simply a bad consolation prize. One rival likened Goldman's explanation to a doctor who botched a brain surgery but bragged about his skill in stitching the patient back together. And if its explanation was that it was trying to help the investors, it failed them by pricing the stock too high in the first place.
Somewhere, Mr. Wasserstein is smiling.

IT was a White House photo-op with a stern message: President Bush, surrounded by a passel of babies, warned last Tuesday against a Congressional bill that would increase federal spending on embryonic stem cell research. The legislation, which had threatened to veto, "would take us across a critical ethical line," he said.
Yet in some ways the president -- and Congress, for that matter -- had been upstaged only four days before. That's when South Korean biomedical researchers reported that they had developed an efficient method for obtaining human stem cells from embryos produced through cloning. Researchers hailed the work as a major breakthrough, one that eventually could make it simpler to get stem cells to study and potentially treat disorders, like Parkinson's and Alzheimer's disease.
The announcement also made plain for researchers an age-old truism: that the march of science and technology cannot be stopped. Slowed, maybe. Modified, probably. But halted completely? No way.
Yet President Bush and religious conservatives have staked much on the idea that they can stop cloning, even when it is undertaken for therapeutic purposes, as is the case with the Korean research.
And there's some evidence to suggest that they aren't just dreaming. While the history of science, and medicine in particular, is full of good ideas that met with opposition that was eventually overcome, there are other episodes where the opposition won out -- often because those ideas were not good ones.
There has been much unsuccessful opposition to medical breakthroughs that are now almost universally recognized as beneficial, like vaccination, dissection and organ transplantation.
Blood transfusions, animal implants and in-vitro fertilization itself have all been met with religious objections. Most have been overcome. But there has been successful opposition to some boneheaded concepts like eugenics. Other bad ideas -- the Tuskegee syphilis experiments and the vivisection of animals come to mind -- have led to the overhaul of research practices and the development and refinement of ethical guidelines.
The debate over therapeutic cloning reflects this mixed history. For some people the research represents a treasure chest of potential therapies; for others it is a Pandora's box, the beginning of a slide toward a dystopian future where life is devalued.
In the end, the outcome of the debate may be determined by the course of the cloning research itself -- whether the public believes at some point that scientists or their opponents have overstepped their bounds. And whether the rest of the world follows along.
Protests to medical research in America began early. Inoculation, a precursor to vaccination, met with much opposition during the first big trials of the technique, in the 1721 Boston smallpox epidemic, said Ronald L. Numbers, a professor of the history of medicine at the University of Wisconsin. (Interestingly, he said, the trials were led by a minister, Cotton Mather, and many of those objecting were physicians, who thought he was playing God.) And when vaccination was developed some 70 years later, Dr. Numbers said, there were religious objections. But these dwindled as the benefits became apparent.
Similarly, Dr. Numbers said, there were protests in the late 18th and early 19th centuries against the dissection of cadavers for medical education. It's not clear how much religious beliefs were responsible for the protests, he said, "although you occasionally have discussions about, if you cut them into pieces, what's going to happen at the time of the resurrection?"
Nathaniel Comfort, an associate professor of history of science and medicine at Johns Hopkins, said that society's views on what is acceptable have changed over the years. When Jacques Loeb announced in 1899 that he had initiated embryonic development in sea urchins without the use of sperm, "the public reaction seems to have been one of awe and surprise and celebration," Dr. Comfort said.
YET seven decades later, when the first successful work on recombinant DNA -- a basic tool of genetic engineering -- was announced, "there was this whole fear of playing God," he said.
"What leaps out at me is how culturally situated this notion of shock and horror at the engineering of life is," he added. "What is it about our times that raises these sorts of moral and ethical concerns?"
In the case of stem cells, some concerns are overshadowed by the tantalizing promise of the research: rejection-free organ transplants, regenerated spinal cords, perfectly matched blood transfusions, cures for diabetes and Alzheimer's.
But those promises run headlong into questions raised by a dark history of research. Take eugenics. According to Christine Rosen, a fellow at the Ethics and Public Policy Center in Washington and the author of "Preaching Eugenics," scientists who supported eugenics claimed that it could cure disease and end poverty -- involuntary sterilizations were one result.
But the scientific underpinnings cited by early eugenics researchers were often wrong, Ms. Rosen said. "The heritability of certain diseases and eye colors were right, but broader claims they made as a result were incorrect," she said.
Many religious groups tried to stop eugenics, Ms. Rosen said, but they were called obstructionists.
"The only thing that stopped this," Ms. Rosen said, "was war and the lessons of Nazi Germany and improvements in science."
The controversy over eugenics is particularly relevant to the current debate, argues Wesley J. Smith, an opponent of therapeutic cloning at the Discovery Institute, a conservative research group in Seattle.
When eugenics was popular, he said, "people at the top levels of society were accepting of the idea that you could improve the human race by improving the gene pool." Even the United States Supreme Court, he said, supported involuntary sterilization, in the 1927 case Buck v. Bell.
To Mr. Smith and others, the march of science toward therapeutic cloning can be stopped. Indeed, cloning may be halted by its own deficiencies, Mr. Smith said. Cloned animals have developed health problems, and there is a potential for tumors in cloned tissue. And research using non-cloned, adult stem cells, which are drawn from bone marrow and blood, "will not have the moral baggage of cloning," he said.
But Dr. Lee M. Silver, a geneticist who is a professor of molecular biology at Princeton, said that therapeutic cloning could not be stopped because the world has changed.
"The difference today is that we're a global village," he said. "Thirty or 40 years ago, Asia had no scientific prominence whatsoever. Now Asia is a real player in the world."
Indeed, the debate over the cloning bill in Washington is largely moot, he said, because the legislation would permit federal financing of studies only involving unwanted embryos from fertility clinics.
That's "too little, too late," he said. "What it would allow American scientists to do is far less efficient than what the Koreans have already accomplished."
"If there are other societies that don't have a problem with this, it's going to happen there," Dr. Silver added. "And that will have ramifications for things here."
A consortium of Hong Kong investors and Donald J. Trump are selling a stretch of riverfront land and three buildings on the Upper West Side for about $1.8 billion in the largest residential sale in city history and in the latest example of a rocketing housing market.
The Extell Development Corporation and the Carlyle Group have a tentative deal to buy a major swath of developable land at the onetime railroad yard between 59th and 72nd Streets, which has been turned into a luxury enclave known variously as Riverside South and Trump Place, according to real estate executives who have been briefed on the deal. The 77-acre property embraces what will be a 21-acre public park that slopes down to the Hudson River.
The deal comes as the average condominium price in Manhattan has soared to more than $1.2 million and as developable land has become increasingly rare, even as some economists worry that a housing bubble will soon burst.
Extell, which is building the 60-story Orion condo tower on 42nd Street and owns the W Hotel in Times Square, is buying the three rental buildings at the site, as well as lots to build eight more apartment houses and nearly 3,000 apartments.
The deal also includes a five-acre parcel between 59th and 62nd Streets that real estate executives said could be rezoned for an additional 1,500 apartments. There are four condo buildings at the site that are not part of the deal.
It is unclear whether any new buildings on the site will bear Mr. Trump's name in characteristic gold letters.
Real estate executives said that the new buyers would have to pay the developer for using his name.
"I think the potential for this site is huge, because in the aftermath of Time Warner Center at Columbus Circle, the redevelopment of the Far West Side is happening at an extremely rapid rate," said Nancy Packes, president of Feathered Nest, a residential broker.
The sale price was a huge number, Ms. Packes added. "But at any given point in time, when land and buildings change hands, people always question the potential rise in value," she said.
Allen Weisselberg, chief financial officer of the Trump Organization, declined to comment. Paul Davis, chief executive of Hudson Waterfront Associations, which represents the Hong Kong investors in New York, was unavailable for comment yesterday.
Longtime critics of Mr. Trump and his project welcomed his departure yesterday.
"Even though they're paying an exorbitant price in this overheated market, we hope the new owners will be more responsive to the community," Madeleine Polayes, a leader of the Coalition for a Livable West Side and a longtime opponent of Mr. Trump and his project, said through a spokeswoman. "Can we get the name changed from Trump Place to something else?"
If it is completed, real estate executives said, the deal should be a windfall for the investors and Mr. Trump, who acquired the land for less than $100 million a decade ago during a real estate recession.
There is little question that the market is hot once again. Last year, the 15-story Mayflower Hotel near Lincoln Center and a vacant lot next door sold for $401 million to a group with plans to build a large apartment tower. And in April, a group led by Kent Swig paid $418 million for the 50-story, 845-unit Sheffield apartment house on 57th Street between Eighth and Ninth Avenues.
The former freight yard property has a long and tortured history as the largest parcel of undeveloped land in Manhattan. Mr. Trump first gained control of the defunct freight yard in 1974. Unable to build, he sold the property to another developer, who also made little progress. Mr. Trump regained control of the property in 1982 and later proposed building Television City, a wall of skyscrapers along the waterfront, including a 150-story tower, the tallest in the world.
But that project came under intense criticism from city planners and civic and neighborhood groups and the proposal died in 1987.
With the city in a deep recession in 1991 and Mr. Trump laboring under enormous debts, the developer redesigned the project with his onetime opponents, the Municipal Art Society and five other civic organizations, creating a 21-acre public park along the water and pulling the buildings back to a newly created extension of Riverside Drive.
To solve his financial problems, Mr. Trump brought in a group of Hong Kong and Chinese investors in 1994, who bought a $300 million mortgage on the land for $82 million. The investors had hoped that construction would start within a year, but continuing opposition from community groups and some elected officials, including Representative Jerrold L. Nadler, delayed the project until 1997.
But since the project started, the apartments have sold and leased well. Real estate executives said that two condo buildings nearing completion were already sold out. Earlier this year, the partners sold a small site to the Atlantic Development Corporation to build about 300 subsidized apartments.
ON just about any summer evening, and many an afternoon as well, the Long Island air fills not just with the sound of cicadas but also with the swell of strings, the pluck of banjos, the crash of cymbals and the pulsating rhythms of synthesized drums.
In villages and parks from Cedarhurst to Montauk, music comes pouring from gazebos and band shells, free for the enjoyment of anyone who pulls up a lawn chair, spreads a blanket or finds a spot on a park bench.
Sometimes, the trumpet player is just back from a Little League game, the drummer is taking a break from lessons at the local music store and the harpist lives down the street. Community and school bands and choirs are a summer staple in many towns, often performing the kinds of John Philip Sousa marches you would expect.
Many of the band shells and gazebos also make room for local theater and dance groups to perform.
But often, the music comes from professional ensembles, taking their acts out of the clubs and auditoriums to enjoy the outdoors right along with the audience, with their fees paid by town and village parks departments, chambers of commerce and arts councils.
And occasionally, you can even catch a nationally known recording artist like Little Richard or Patti Page, Phoebe Snow or the Dixie Hummingbirds. Or at least, a good imitation: "tribute" singers and bands recreating the songs of anyone from Bobby Darin to Pink Floyd are often on the bill.
Many stages feature programs of ethnic music, reflecting the diversity of Long Islanders' origins. Nostalgia is another big theme, with dozens of performances by swing bands, golden-oldies ensembles, banjo groups and others evoking yesteryear with music.
Here is a compendium of gazebos and band shells on the Island that will be offering programs of music this summer, along with selected dates when specific artists are scheduled to perform. Following the gazebos and band shells are listings for some mobile stages and other kinds of parks, like beaches and botanical gardens, that also offer outdoor music in the summer.
In all cases, the entertainment itself is free, though fees may be charged at some locations for entry to the park or for parking. There is generally little or no fixed seating for the audience: relaxing on the grass is part of the fun, though many attendees bring lawn chairs.
As you would expect with any outdoor event, lineups and schedules are subject to change for weather and other reasons.

The Historian A Novel By Elizabeth Kostova 642 pages. Little, Brown & Company. $25.95.
Garlic and crucifixes are traditionally part of the arsenal for vanquishing vampires. But in "The Historian," the Dracula-da Vinci Code hybrid that has emerged as the most heavily hyped novel of the summer, the first-time author Elizabeth Kostova tries a different tactic. Perhaps even the undead can be talked to death.
In a ponderous, many-layered book that is exquisitely versed in the art of stalling, Ms. Kostova steeps her readers in Dracula lore. She visits many libraries, monasteries, relics of the Byzantine and Ottoman empires, crypts, restaurants, scholars and folk-song-singing peasants. Every now and then a mysterious pale, sinister figure will materialize, only to vanish bewilderingly. The book's characters find this a lot more baffling than readers will.
"You've heard of Vlad Tepes -- the Impaler?" Prof. Bartholomew Rossi asks Paul, his student, early in the novel. "Really among the nastiest of all medieval European tyrants. It's estimated that he slaughtered at least 20,000 of his fellow Wallachians and Transylvanians over the years." The book's map of cold war Europe includes the Romanian regions Wallachia and Transylvania, as well as Lake Snagov, one of several scenic spots that Dracula is suspected of using as eternal homes.
A $2 million advance, a movie sale and the prospect of publication in at least 28 languages all attest to Ms. Kostova's marketable knowledge of horror lore. She has Professor Rossi explain that the word Dracula refers to the Holy Roman Empire's Order of the Dragon. She lets the professor reveal how "at the end of the 19th century, a disturbed and melodramatic author -- Abraham Stoker -- gets hold of the name Dracula and fastens it on a creature of his own invention, a vampire." Her own contribution to the genre involves resurrecting Vlad the Impaler, separating him from Stoker's version and leading readers on a scavenger hunt based on Vlad's marauding travels and evil deeds.
The vampire's power to inflict misery pales beside that of the book's contorted narrative structure. "The Historian" begins in 1972 as an account by Paul's daughter, who is looking back on these events, and whose introduction to the novel is dated Jan. 15, 2008. Her reflections are interspersed with Paul's long story, which he laboriously put into writing. Paul spends much of the book with Helen Rossi, who will eventually be the mother of his child, the original narrator, as they search for Professor Rossi -- Helen's father -- after he disappears.
Helen writes too, but only brief notes. This automatically makes her the book's most likeable character, despite the fact that she bears an unnerving resemblance to Vlad.
The professor has also left behind reams of extremely professorial letters. "My quick-minded reader, you are staying awake for me, following my lucubrations with care, and I bless you for it," he observes with typically stilted rigor.
For various reasons, each of these characters seeks to discover where the 15th-century monster was interred. This mission allows Paul and Helen to meet cute at a library where each is immersed in research. Helen makes the first move. "Dracula?" she asks provocatively. "Those appear to be primary sources you have got there." In this book's scholarly scheme, nothing is sexier than a primary source with a dragon connection.
As "The Historian" unfolds, Ms. Kostova moves her characters around the globe with exhausting determination. She also finds endless ways to interrupt them as they speak. ("I must pause here, brave reader; I cannot bring myself to write more, for the moment.") But if these maneuvers are meant to heighten suspense, they have the opposite effect: the tactics are irritatingly transparent and coy. And they illustrate why not every writer in the wildly burgeoning history-mystery category is liable to be the next Dan Brown.
Although "The Historian" is wearyingly long, it would be a difficult book to compress. No one of Ms. Kostova's travelogue episodes (of Romania, Hungary and Turkey, among other places) is any more expendable than the others; it's just that the cumulative effect of so much tourism is smothering. Only occasionally does the book deliver the kind of jolt that explains its prematurely inflated reputation. At one point, Paul and his daughter are at a cafe in Italy when a street painter tries to sell them a watercolor. It depicts father, daughter and "a broad-shouldered, dark-headed figure, a crisp black silhouette, among the cheerful colors of awning and tablecloths." Uh-oh: the table at which the painter saw this specter has been vacant all afternoon.
Notwithstanding such piquant glimpses, it takes more than 500 pages for the book's undead superstar to arrive for real. When he does, he personifies the thought that every age gets the Dracula it deserves. This book's version is quite the egomaniac; he is very interested in the medieval equivalent of his own press clippings. "I became an historian," he says, "in order to preserve my own history forever."
As it vacillates between generating suspense and showing off erudition, the book frequently speculates on the meaning of history. "There is survival and survival, the historian learns to his grief," Ms. Kostova writes. "The very worst impulses of humankind can survive generations, centuries, even millennia. And the best of our individual efforts can die with us at the end of a single lifetime."
On a more positive note, one of her characters speaks of being "struck by the excitement of the traveler who looks history in her subtle face." But history's subtle face is not the one displayed here.
Chris Griffin, a trumpet player who was heard at Carnegie Hall with Benny Goodman and in millions of living rooms with the orchestras on the Ed Sullivan and Jackie Gleason shows, died on June 18 in Danbury, Conn. He was 89 and lived in Southbury, Conn.
The cause was melanoma, said his fiancée, Louise Baranger.
Born Gordon Griffin in Binghamton, N.Y., on Oct. 31, 1915, he was the last surviving member of Goodman's band for his historic Carnegie Hall concert of 1938, the first major jazz event there.
Mr. Griffin was barely out of his teens when he joined the Goodman band. But he was already a seasoned professional, having worked with the saxophonist Charlie Barnet and the singer Rudy Vallee. He was a member of the CBS Radio Orchestra when the impresario John Hammond recommended him to Goodman in 1936.
The Goodman trumpet section was widely admired; no less an authority than Duke Ellington called it the best of all time. But the other members of the section at that time, Harry James and Ziggy Elman, were more flamboyant players and were given more solo opportunities than Mr. Griffin, whose musical style was melodic rather than dramatic and whose personal style was self-effacing rather than self-promoting.
He kept out of the spotlight for practical reasons as well. After he left Goodman in 1939 he was offered financial backing to lead his own band, but he chose to return to his old staff job at CBS because he had two children, with a third on the way.
Mr. Griffin remained primarily a studio musician until he retired in the late 1970's. On radio and later television at CBS, he played for Sullivan, Gleason and others. (He created the trumpet obbligato heard for many years on Gleason's theme song.) The long list of performers he accompanied on recordings included Frank Sinatra, Billie Holiday, Charlie Parker and Louis Armstrong.
Mr. Griffin was the subject of a recently published book, "Sittin' In With Chris Griffin," by Warren W. Vaché.
In addition to Ms. Baranger, he is survived by three sons, Gerald, of Danbury Conn.; Paul, of Jeffersonville, N.Y.; and Thomas, of Glen Cove, N.Y.; two daughters, Patricia E. Griffin of Jeffersonville and Eileen R. Relyea of Bayville, N.Y.; seven grandchildren; and four great-grandchildren. His wife of 60 years, Helen, and another son, George, both died in 2000.
Trump Entertainment Resorts has named James B. Perry to succeed the real estate developer Donald J. Trump as its chief executive, the casino group yesterday.
Mr. Perry retired in 2003 as the chief executive of the riverboat casino operator Argosy Gaming Company.
Trump Entertainment Resorts, which owns and operates casinos in Atlantic City, said in May when it emerged from Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection that it was looking for a new chief executive.
WASHINGTON, July 7 - Pedro Martínez, who has had a standout first half of the season with the Mets, said on Thursday that he would forfeit his spot on the National League team for the All-Star Game next week.
Martínez is scheduled to start Sunday for the Mets in Pittsburgh, the last game before the break, and he said he would not want to pitch again just two days later. Although he usually throws in a side session two days after he pitches in a game, he said he does not throw with full effort, something he would require of himself in an All-Star Game. His decision now leaves him available to pitch on a regular amount of rest next Friday in a crucial series against the Braves.
Martínez also cited the extra significance now attached to the All-Star Game, with the winning league earning home-field advantage in the World Series. "If I couldn't pitch," he said, "it makes no sense for me to occupy my place.
"It's not in the best interest of myself or the organization for me to watch everyone else compete and sit down in the bullpen," he added. "I would like for somebody else to compete."
After Martínez made his decision, National League Manager Tony La Russa picked Phillies closer Billy Wagner and shortstop Jimmy Rollins to replace Martínez and the Dodgers' Cesar Izturis, who is on the disabled list. Izturis has been hampered by a sore right hamstring for nearly a month.
Martínez, who is 9-3 with a 2.80 earned run average in 17 starts this season, earned his seventh All-Star selection last month. He has attended four of the games and pitched in three.
He dressed but asked American League Manager Mike Hargrove not to pitch him during the 1998 contest, and he missed the 2000 game while on the disabled list. In 2002, Martínez skipped the game for personal reasons, went home to the Dominican Republic, and returned late to the Red Sox.
Martínez was also playing for the Red Sox when he started the 1999 All-Star Game at Fenway Park. He has not allowed a run in four innings of All-Star pitching, and he tied a record for the American League with five strikeouts in his two innings of work in the 1999 game.
Mets General Manager Omar Minaya said that Martínez met with him and the team's chief operating officer, Jeff Wilpon, before announcing his decision. Martínez said he wasn't sure about how he would spend the time off from baseball. Regardless, Minaya said the team supported its star's decision.
"When it's all said and done, it's about his health," Minaya said. "And it's about him being ready for the second half."

A lawsuit filed yesterday by Donald J. Trump seems to be trying to answer the question, when is $1.76 billion not enough?
The suit, filed by Mr. Trump in Federal District Court in Manhattan, claims that his Hong Kong partners sold their riverside development on the Upper West Side for a mere $1.76 billion, or about half the amount offered by other developers and investors. Mr. Trump claims that the deal to sell the 77-acre property to Extell Development Company and the Carlyle Group was a "staggering breach" of his partners' duty to get top dollar.
Mr. Trump concedes that he stands to get about 30 percent of the purchase price, roughly $500 million. But he said that it could have been much more if the Hong Kong investors had held a public auction, or negotiated with developers and investors who, according to the lawsuit as well as letters provided by Mr. Trump's lawyers, had offered up to $3 billion for the property, which runs between 59th and 72nd Streets.
Instead, Mr. Trump's partners, a consortium of Chinese investors and billionaires led by Henry Cheng and Vincent Lo, began to sell the property late last year without talking to Mr. Trump, the lawsuit claims, and ignored offers of $2.9 billion from Colony Capital, a real estate investment company based in Los Angeles, and $3 billion from Richard LeFrak, a major New York developer.
"There's something seriously wrong here," Mr. Trump said in an interview yesterday. "This is one of the finest pieces of property in the world. And this is the hottest real estate market in history. They ought to be ashamed of themselves."
Paul Davis, the chief executive of Hudson Waterfront Associates, which represents the Hong Kong investors in New York, said he had not seen the suit and had no comment.
Extell's president, Gary Barnett, said he was surprised by Mr. Trump's move. "We have a legal and binding contract with the owners and the authorized seller," he said. "We hope Trump is not seeking to interfere with that contract."
According to real estate executives, at least two development companies -- Vornado Realty Trust and the Related Companies -- considered buying the Upper West Side property, known variously as Riverside South and Trump Place, but found the $1.76 billion price tag too daunting. Pension funds and other investor groups, however, might have been willing to pay more because prices in New York continue to soar at an unprecedented rate.
Mr. Trump's suit added some spice to the allegations, claiming that the Cheng Group did not report hundreds of millions of dollars of profit to "avoid paying taxes in China and the United States." The suit claims that Mr. Trump has uncovered "fraud by the Cheng Group amounting to at least $19.7 million."
The pending deal for the property, which includes three existing rental towers and sites on which to build 8 to 10 more apartment buildings -- with nearly 3,000 apartments -- first surfaced publicly on June 1. Three weeks later, Extell and the Carlyle Group agreed to sell only the three rental buildings to Equity Residential, the nation's largest publicly traded apartment owner, for a reported $816 million.
To add insult to Mr. Trump's presumed injury, he said that his partners refused to distribute the proceeds of the sale unless he agreed to invest the money with them in another "unknown property," which would have reduced or eliminated their tax exposure.
Mr. Trump's suit raises a question of whether his Hong Kong partners had a secret arrangement to sell the project to the Carlyle Group, a private equity firm that manages money and buys property for Saudi royalty and other Middle Eastern families, among other clients.
The Hong Kong investors bought the land in 1994 for less than $100 million.
Correction: July 26, 2005, Tuesday An article on July 12 about a lawsuit filed by Donald J. Trump against his Asian partners over the sale of property on the Upper West Side referred incorrectly to the clients of the Carlyle Group, a private equity firm that was one of the buyers. Although it buys property on behalf of Middle Eastern investors, it says none of them are members of the Saudi royal family.
When Amazon.com released its Musicians Hall of Fame this month, ranking the Top 25-selling CD's in the site's 10-year history, a few of the results might have been surprising -- Enya at No. 8? -- but all the names on the list were recognizable stars. Except one: No. 5, Eva Cassidy.
Cassidy, right, was an angelic-voiced but little-known singer whose death from cancer at 33, in 1996, inspired a phenomenal demand for her renditions of songbook standards, jazz and gospel, leading to six posthumous albums culled from unreleased recordings. She's not necessarily out of place on Amazon's list, which skews wildly toward white pop-rock (the only solo black artist is Ray Charles at No. 23) and hardly reflects album sales beyond Amazon. But ahead of Bob Dylan (No. 9), Bruce Springsteen (No. 12) and Elvis (No. 25)?
The explanation probably lies in the rise of the Internet as a tastemaker, and the explosive growth of online commerce that Amazon itself pioneered. The independent Blix Street label began releasing Cassidy's recordings in 1998, the year Amazon added music to its inventory. A word-of-mouth campaign, fueled by chat rooms and fan sites, began to seep into the news media, and by December 2000 two Cassidy albums had pushed a top-selling Beatles compilation down to No. 3 at Amazon, with three other Cassidy albums at Nos. 4, 5 and 7. Just how many CD's she has sold on Amazon to reach No. 5 is unknown; the company does not release sales information other than comparative rankings. But thanks to Amazon consumers, Eva Cassidy is enjoying an unlikely, and lucrative, sort of immortality. JOEL TOPCIK
A group of Hong Kong billionaires asked a federal court yesterday to dismiss Donald J. Trump's lawsuit in which he claims they are selling valuable waterfront property for half of what it is worth. The group said Mr. Trump was merely "a minority limited partner" in the partnerships that own the 16-acre riverside property between 59th and 72nd Streets on the Upper West Side, and had "no right to participate" in the decision to sell it for $1.76 billion to the Carlyle Group and Extell Development Company. Mr. Trump -- who stands to get more than $300 million from the sale -- said, "They are going to lose this case and they're going to have pay me hundreds of millions of dollars more." Charles V. Bagli (NYT)
They are draining the East River from the old East River Savings Bank.
The 35-foot-high former banking hall on Church Street, between Dey and Cortlandt Streets, now bustles as the main sales floor of the Century 21 department store. Workers are finishing a new 5,000-square-foot mezzanine balcony, reached by a grand staircase, that is meant to preserve the hall's spatial grandeur.
But clothing display cases being installed on the mezzanine will permanently block a monumental trompe-l'oeil mural by Dale Stetson. This 3,000-square-foot panorama depicted a bird's-eye view of the navy-blue East River coursing along Manhattan's edge, from Hell Gate to the harbor. It was recessed behind real window frames in five bays along the rear wall, furthering the illusion that viewers were glimpsing the city from some tropospheric aerie. Perhaps it took depositors' minds off the grimmer earthbound realities of 1935, when the building opened as the bank's main office.
Lewis Mumford, the architectural critic of The New Yorker, greeted the mural as "one of the dullest" in New York. But 70 years later, it offered -- to those who could pry their eyes off the bargain racks -- a charming counterpoise to the frenetic activity on the sales floor. One could spot the Queensboro Bridge in the second window; Newtown Creek in the third; the Williamsburg, Manhattan and Brooklyn Bridges in the fourth; and Jamaica Bay, distantly, in the fifth.
In the mural, time is frozen at a moment when the river bristled with vessels and piers, when the Empire State Building was dirigible-ready, when Rockefeller Center loomed over Midtown like a towering mesa.
To preserve views of the mural, Century 21 would have had to sacrifice more than 50 feet of selling space. And in retailing, "every square inch is a dollar," said Joshua H. Burdick, president of SBLM Architects, which designed the renovation. He said the mural would remain protected behind glass in four of the original bays.
Sharp-eyed shoppers may notice another change when the mezzanine opens next month. The legend, "Founded 1848," flanking a wall clock at the south end of the hall, has been changed to reflect the current ownership. "Founded 1961," it now reads.
OWINGS MILLS, Md. - In a corridor leading to the cavernous field house where the Baltimore Ravens practice, the team has posted plaques commemorating the annual leaders in major statistical categories.
Linebacker Ray Lewis is inscribed as the leading tackler so often on the little gold plates that his name appears to be mashed together into one big entry covering more than half a decade. But it is the offensive plaques that catch the eye for the lesson they offer in how a franchise can be haunted -- and halted -- by an inability to simply score points.
That did not matter in the 2000 season, when the Ravens' defense was so dominant on the way to a Super Bowl championship that it rendered the offense virtually irrelevant. That defense allowed the fewest points in a 16-game season in N.F.L. history -- 165 -- a good thing because the offense had five games without a touchdown. They were the anti-Patriots, a team that proved you did not have to be balanced -- in fact, you barely had to be functional on one side of the ball -- to win a title.
But the plaques bear the grim reminders of failed attempts since then to provide some ballast for that defense. There were the Elvis Grbac and Jeff Blake experiments at quarterback. In 2003, running back Jamal Lewis churned out 2,066 yards, more than 800 yards more than the rookie quarterback Kyle Boller managed to throw for. And last year, the leading receiver was Travis Taylor, with only 421 yards, underscoring just how bad a receiving corps Boller was working with after the Ravens' aborted attempt to acquire Terrell Owens.
As the new season begins, the Ravens are again desperate to prove they are not a cliché dressed in shoulder pads. If they fail this time, it will not be for the lack of trying.
The former Giants coach Jim Fassel, who tutored Boller last season, was installed as the offensive coordinator to shore up a unit that finished 31st in the league last season. Rick Neuheisel, the former college wunderkind who recruited Boller while at the University of Washington, is the new quarterbacks coach. Derrick Mason, a 90-plus-catch receiver with the Titans, was signed. And the Ravens used a first-round draft pick on receiver Mark Clayton, who joins former first-rounders like Boller and tight end Todd Heap.
Coach Brian Billick, who got the Ravens job partly because of the powerhouse offense he helped construct in Minnesota in the late 1990's, compares his conundrum to those of Indianapolis Coach Tony Dungy and Cincinnati Coach Marvin Lewis. Those two have been branded defensive gurus, much as Billick made his name as an offensive mastermind. And as head coaches, all three have had to deal with the bewilderment and frustration that comes with watching one unit -- in these cases, not the unit they are most familiar with -- dominate the team.
"God has a strange sense of humor," Billick said. "Do I care how we win? No. I don't make a penny for leading the league in any offensive category. But I make a lot of money if we win games. So greed is good."
Billick was joking, but he had just come from a news conference in which he spent most of his time defending Boller, who played so poorly in a preseason game against the Eagles that he was booed by the home fans.
The Ravens reject the notion that they have a limited window of opportunity to make another Super Bowl run while this defense is so dominant. They have reloaded since 2000 with first-round draft picks like safety Ed Reed and linebacker/defensive end Terrell Suggs, even as Ray Lewis speaks of being the league's most valuable player at age 30.
But the analysis of this team is simplistic and inescapable: If the Ravens' offense cannot become at least respectable, the franchise will continue to waste a defense that will be remembered as one of the best ever.
"We've known it would be very tough to do it the way we did it," Ravens General Manager Ozzie Newsome said. "We've tried to upgrade offensively."
But this year represents the most concerted effort since 2001, when the Ravens -- mindful that a scorched-earth salary-cap purge was coming in 2002 -- thought they had a chance to repeat as champions by keeping the defense intact and bringing in Grbac to lend some firepower to the offense.
That plan failed and the purge took its toll, but the Ravens made it back to the playoffs in 2003 and were expected to go back last year. Newsome said the team was bitter that it missed the playoffs last season. Now, in Boller's third year, the Ravens hope he will have his Drew Brees moment, when the concerns about his mechanics and his supporting cast will give way to his natural ability, and he will come into his own, as Brees did with the Chargers last season.
As the Ravens see it, Boller must improve by just the slimmest of margins to make a difference. He completed 55 percent of his passes last season; the Ravens want it to be 60 percent, the cutoff line for good N.F.L. quarterbacks. By Billick's calculations, that means Boller would have to complete just two more passes a game over a 500-pass season. Then, the traditional Ravens philosophy will take over: Give Jamal Lewis the ball and let the defense do the rest.
"When you have a defense built full of first-rounders, you're going to have an easier time," Suggs said. "We have a lot of stars built in. Whenever you've got a team like this, you want to make a run for it. I think this is our best chance to win it. We got the pieces on offense, and we definitely got the pieces on defense."
But the Ravens have thought that before, and all they have had to show for it since the 2000 season are a lot of defensive players in the Pro Bowl. Even now, the Ravens cannot stay away from gilding their already golden defense. On the day they signed Mason as a free agent, they also signed cornerback Samari Rolle from the Titans.
"We have a fair amount of assets on offense," Billick said. "We have a chance to have that balance. But it's been a five- or six-year process getting there."
IT is impossible to read Donald Trump's blog without hearing his voice and picturing him typing away in his Turnbull & Asser pajamas, sleep still in his eyes. Otherwise, "The Trump Blog" (what else?) seems a lot like most other blogs. Which is to say, lightweight and highly egocentric.
The Trump Blog is featured on the Web site for Trump University (trumpuniversity.com), which is basically a series of seminars on how to get rich. Mr. Trump and "his circle of experts" run the blog, though The Donald himself ducks in only occasionally.
"The glamour and grandeur of my buildings and my life are no mere trappings. Beauty and elegance, whether in a woman or a work of art, is not something superficial, not just something pretty to look at." So opens his entry titled "Success With Style." "Style is what moves people, and style is what the best always have in spades."
That, and their name spelled out across skyscrapers in humongous bronze letters.
On those occasions when he's not talking about himself, Mr. Trump takes on political and economic issues. He doesn't go too deep, though. After all, he's a busy man.
Gas at $3 a gallon is "just ridiculous," he declares in a recent 200-word post. What's to be done? "I wish that the United States would just get on the ball with alternative energy."
How to pay for it? Divert money from the National Aeronautics and Space Administration.
He envisions leaders of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries "just laughing as they continue to jack up the price per gallon." And if our political leaders weren't so ineffectual, they would stand up to OPEC and threaten "to stop protecting all those countries."
"Better yet," he writes, "stop sending those politicians over there to negotiate. Send a true business leader -- someone who is used to tough bargaining -- and see how far he or she could get."
Hmmm. Which business leader could he possibly be thinking of? Steve Wynn, his fellow developer, maybe?
FLICKRING LIGHTS -- Yahoo recently acquired Flickr, a once-independent community site for posting and sharing photos. Now, Yahoo, the Internet giant, is planning to force its users to join the Yahoo network to log on to the site.
Hundreds have protested, with many joining "Flick Off," a Flickr page created to discuss the problem and to plan a "mass suicide" by deleting their identities rather than join Yahoo.
Stewart Butterfield, a Flickr founder, tried to assuage their concerns in a frequently-asked- questions-like blog entry laced with affected humor. Don't worry, he basically said, nothing will change except that you will have to log in using a Yahoo ID. The one concern he didn't address is the one that really bothers the Flickr Flock: They don't want any part of Yahoo. Flickr proudly evolved off the grid and out of the mainstream. Forcing members to join Yahoo is like forcing followers of the grrl group Sleater-Kinney to join the Dixie Chicks fan club.
CENSOR OR CENSURE -- Business Week Online features a fascinating, if short, interview with Hu Zhiguang, founder of Blogcn, a leading provider of blog services in China, on www.businessweek.com. American bloggers may complain about comment spammers and flame wars, but at least they don't have to worry about "the Internet police" (at least, not yet).
Blogcn includes keyword filters in its software. So if a blogger tries to type in "Falun Gong," for example, it will show up online as a string of asterisks. Bloggers try workarounds, but Mr. Hu says he stays on top of it. "If it lasts on the site too long, then maybe it will make some trouble. Maybe I will have to go to the police station."
GIVE IT UP -- Bloggers have made a valiant effort to collect money for victims of Hurricane Katrina. Sadly, though, they remain stuck in ideological camps, often listing only charities they deem "correct." But a nonpartisan "wiki" has been set up where charities can be found or added, at katrinahelp.info/wiki. DAN MITCHELL
Tomas Berdych bounced out of his chair at the end of every changeover yesterday and skipped to his side of the court. A 19-year-old from the Czech Republic, he was playing so well it seemed he could hardly wait to hit his next shot.
His third-round opponent at the United States Open, Andre Agassi, shuffled to and fro like, well, a 35-year-old with an iffy back.
Berdych was the better player in the beginning, but Agassi was the one taking the bows at the end, his 3-6, 6-1, 6-4, 7-6 (2) victory a triumph of experience over exuberance.
Agassi participated in his first Open before Berdych, who was born in September 1985, commemorated his first birthday.
While Berdych was growing up in the town of Valasske Mezirici, Agassi's game matured. In 20 trips to Flushing Meadows, Agassi, a two-time champion, has evolved from a flashy shot-maker into a solid composer of points. The difference was discernible in the two-and-a-half-hour match, during which Agassi committed just 23 unforced errors to Berdych's 43.
"I had to learn how to play the game," Agassi said. "In my mind, as good a player as Berdych is, he can be a lot better. He still has a lot to discover himself."
Berdych was serving for the fourth set at 5-3 when he let the pro-Agassi crowd get under his skin. Trailing by 0-15, Berdych stopped playing the next point because he heard a voice call a ball out. Berdych's protestations to the chair fell on deaf ears, and he was soon broken.
Agassi seized his chance to end the match in four sets. He forced the tie breaker by holding serve with a beautifully disguised drop shot from the baseline. Berdych could just shake his head and look heavenward.
Decades of pulling off shots like that have done nothing to diminish the pleasure they bring to Agassi.
"I think a perfectly played drop shot is one of the prettiest shots to watch in the game, next to the topspin lob," he said, smiling broadly. "When you do it well, the second it leaves your racket, you get about a second and a half to be a spectator and watch it."
Berdych could take some comfort in knowing that he was making progress; the last time he met Agassi, at the 2004 Australian Open, he was beaten, 6-0, 6-2, 6-4.
Justice Richard B. Lowe III of State Supreme Court in Manhattan yesterday rejected Donald J. Trump's request for a preliminary injunction against his Hong Kong partners, whom he has accused of intentionally selling the Trump Place and Riverside South development on the West Side for half their true value. While the ruling does not end his claims against his partners, it permits them to collect the proceeds from selling the property, 77 acres between 59th and 72nd Streets. The partners, a consortium of Chinese investors, sold the development this year to Extell Development Company and the Carlyle Group for $1.76 billion. Mr. Trump, whose share of the sale is 30 percent, had sought to prevent his partners from investing the proceeds in another real estate project. Mr. Trump's lawyer, Marc Kasowitz, said he was disappointed by the ruling. Andrew Jacobs (NYT)
DONALD J. TRUMP is moving into Jersey City in a big way. He is set to announce this week that construction of Trump Plaza, a $415 million condominium project to include the two tallest residential towers in New Jersey, will begin in November -- with occupancy projected to start in fall 2007.
Metro Homes of Hoboken will team up with the Trump Organization in building the project, which is also to include retailing space, parking and amenities for residents like a rooftop pool, fitness center, business center and private film theater.
Dean S. Geibel, who with his partner Paul E. Fried runs Metro Homes, said he initially pitched the idea to Mr. Trump. "We know he likes to do things that are big," Mr. Geibel said, "and this is really big. Plus, it will be highly visible from Manhattan, and so it's right up Trump's alley."
Trump Plaza will be set on a riverside plot at Washington Boulevard and Bay Street, and the triangular design of its two towers, 50 and 55 stories tall and rising from a seven-story base, will permit views of the Manhattan skyline across the Hudson River from almost every apartment, Mr. Geibel said.
The 55-story tower will have 445 condos; the 50-story tower will provide 417. The 328,658-square-foot, seven-story base will house a garage with 696 parking spaces and 23,000 square feet of retailing space.
The two-story building lobby will be "classic Trump, extravagant and classy," Mr. Geibel said.
The condos will range in size from studios to three-bedroom units, offering from 750 to 2,224 square feet.
Neither Mr. Geibel nor the Trump Organization specified a price range for the condos but said more details would be forthcoming on Thursday at a formal announcement of the project.
Currently, the tallest residential building in New Jersey stands only two blocks away from the Trump Plaza site. It is the 40-story Marbella apartment building at 425 Washington Boulevard.
The state's tallest building is also nearby, the 781-foot Goldman Sachs office tower at 30 Hudson Street. ANTOINETTE MARTIN
JERSEY CITY, Sept. 22 - With a trio of trumpeters playing a fanfare, Donald J. Trump on Thursday helped unveil an artist's rendering of his latest project, Trump Plaza: Jersey City. The new luxury condominium development would be the tallest residential development in the state.
The $415 million project will include two towers, 50 stories and 55 stories, with 862 condominium units and 23,000 square feet of retail space. The towers will be at Washington and Bay Streets, a few blocks from the Hudson River and near the Powerhouse Arts District. "It really cements Jersey City as the hottest place to be in the Northeast," said Mayor Jerramiah T. Healy. "It's a big step in the great progress Jersey City has made in the past years." Each condo unit will receive a 20-year property tax abatement, but Mr. Healy said the city would receive more money from development and building fees the developers paid than the city would have received in property taxes.
The Trump Organization will manage the complex, which will include a business center, and amenities for residents like a movie theater, an 8,000-square-foot fitness center, and a heated outdoor rooftop pool. Apartments will feature marble bathrooms and exotic wood floors.
The price of the units, which will range in size from 750 to 2,224 square feet, has not been determined, said Dean Scott Geibel, founder of Metro Homes L.L.C., a developer from Hoboken. He noted that the units will be cheaper than comparable condos in Manhattan. At Grandview, another of Mr. Geibel's residential projects in Jersey City, farther from the waterfront, condominiums sold for about $600 a square foot, with a range of $289,000 to $906,000, and all but one unit has sold since it opened last year, a spokesman for Metro Homes said.
Mr. Geibel called the project "a poster child for smart growth," because of its proximity to PATH stations, light rail, and the ferry to Manhattan.
Barbara Netchert, the executive director of the Jersey City Redevelopment Agency, said earlier plans called for office space development on the property, which is now a parking lot and had been a warehouse and rail yards.
"It was converted to residential, as has most of the projects in the city," she said. "The office market was flat, and the economics were moving more for residential."
Mayor Healy called the project a benchmark for the city. "We've done great for the last 20 years, but this takes it to another level," he said. Mr. Trump, who three times declared himself the biggest developer in New York City, a description his competitors dispute, noted that in moving west of Manhattan, he was going against the usual developer's path, "but I've usually been pretty good at predicting trends." Construction is expected to start in two months and last two years. Mr. Trump estimated that 1,200 to 1,300 workers would be employed in the construction. At 560 feet, the tallest of the towers would still rank below the state's tallest building, the 781-foot Goldman Sachs tower nearby at 30 Hudson Street.
At one point before the project's picture was unveiled, a gust of wind flipped Mr. Trump's swooping hair.
"See, my hair is real, folks," he said. "If it weren't, with this wind, you'd have a much bigger story than these two buildings, there's no doubt in my mind."
Real hair or not, Mr. Trump impressed city leaders.
"As a New York mogul, when he crosses the river, it's a magic step," said the city council president, Mariano Vega.
William A. Vacchiano, a master of the trumpet who never missed a concert during 38 years in the New York Philharmonic and is said to have instructed some 2,000 students, died on Monday. He was 93.
The Juilliard School, where he taught for many years, announced his death.
Mr. Vacchiano retired from the orchestra as principal trumpeter in 1973 but continued his career as an influential teacher. His students included Miles Davis, Wynton Marsalis and Philip Smith, the Philharmonic's current principal trumpeter.
Mr. Vacchiano was born in Portland, Me., and took up the instrument at 12, making such progress that he joined the Portland Symphony at 14. After attending Juilliard, he auditioned for the Metropolitan Opera and the Philharmonic and was offered jobs at both on the same day.
He picked the Philharmonic and was named to the top job in 1942, playing for conductors like Dimitri Mitropoulos, Leopold Stokowski and Leonard Bernstein, and appearing on numerous recordings.
Mr. Vacchiano's technique was superb, naturally, but he was also known for his smooth sound. He once said that a controlled vibrato, clarity of attack and beautiful tone were the hallmarks of great trumpet playing.
He taught at Juilliard from 1935 until 2002, as well as at four other schools, including the Mannes College of Music and the Manhattan School of Music. He said in a 2002-3 newsletter from Stork Custom Mouthpieces, "I had to be in so many places that I had people who made their living just getting my instruments from one hall to the next and having cabs ready for me."
As a teacher, he placed special emphasis on the mouthpiece and finding the right one. In 1940, using tools from a hardware store, he worked on his own and went on to acquire several hundred, as well as designing a line of them. He was also a proponent of studying trumpets made in different keys, and helped establish the practice of using the right one for the right music, rather than transposing.
Mr. Vacchiano is survived by his daughter, JoAnn Vacchiano, and four grandchildren.
He compared teaching to what a painter does. "He sees a subject and from it he creates a great piece of art," he said in the newsletter. "My students come in, more or less, raw and green. But from them I can reproduce myself, you might say, and create great artists."
Mr. Vacchiano said he also tried to instill a healthy attitude about music.
"This is the way life should be," he said. "This, to me, is happiness. When I feel bad I go down to the studio in my house, I pick up my horn and I'm in seventh heaven. That's what music should be like."
The Von Zedtwitz Double Knockout Team Championship runs for most of the year. As the title explains, for a team to be eliminated it must be defeated twice. In this year's event, Mike Kamil, Christal Henner-Welland, Martin Fleisher, Rich Friesner, Bjorn Fallenius and Roy Welland have reached the final undefeated.
The semifinal between the two once-defeated teams pitted Willie Ehlers, Franco Baseggio, Mike Kopera, Jim Krekorian, John Rengstorff and Andy Stark against Win Allegaert, Judy Bianco, Jane Dillenberg, Simon Ehrlich, Jerry Goldberg and Jeff Rothstein.
The diagramed deal is from this match. North, Bianco, did not open one no-trump, promising 15-17 points, because she added one point for her five-card suit. Her second-round double showed three-card diamond support with any point count.
Against two no-trump, West, Stark, led his fourth-highest heart. East, Baseggio, won with his jack and returned the heart five to dummy's ace. The declarer, Allegaert, led a club to his king, played off the club queen, and continued with a diamond to dummy's jack. East won with his king, cashed the heart queen (dummy threw a club), and exited with the diamond ten. South won with dummy's ace, took the club ace (discarding a heart from hand) and led a diamond to his queen. South needed two more tricks with these cards remaining:
If South had played a spade now, he would have taken only one more trick, but he correctly led his last diamond, which executed an unusual version of a suicide squeeze on West. If he discarded the club jack, dummy would get one trick in each black suit. But when West threw a low spade, South collected two spade tricks, West having no entry to cash his club jack.
That was nicely done, but the Allegaert team received bad news, good news and worse news.
At the other table, East did not double over one club, South responded one heart, North rebid two no-trump, and South raised to three no-trump. East led his fourth-highest spade, the declarer, Krekorian, taking West's queen with his king. After a club to the queen and the club king, North played a diamond to his jack and East's king. If East had shifted to the heart queen, the contract would have been defeated, but he continued with a low spade, so Krekorian established his clubs and collected two spades, one heart, two diamonds and four clubs. He lost two spades, one diamond and one club.
So, bad news, the Allegaert team lost 7 international match points on the deal. Good news, the Allegaert team went on to win the match, but, worse news, to take the trophy it must defeat the Kamil team twice.
The Greater New York Bridge Association New York Sectional will be held in the New Yorker Hotel from Friday to Oct. 9. Full details are available at www.gnyba.org.
Thursday's column misstated the number of spade ruffs declarer had to take on the board. It was two, not one.
Donald Trump said yesterday that he would join with a development company in Dubai, in the United Arab Emirates, to build hotels and condominiums in the Middle East, his first foray into the region.
The first project with the company, Nakheel, will be the Palm Trump International Hotel and Tower, a hotel-and-residential tower with about 50 stories that will be built at Jumeirah, a residential development built on the Palm, a man-made island in the Persian Gulf off Dubai.
"We have very big projects planned," Mr. Trump, 59, said in an interview. "They're really very upscale and large. "
His closely held real estate company, the Trump Organization, will also develop Nakheel property at the World, a collection of 300 private islands, also off Dubai. Mr. Trump declined to give further details of his Middle East developments or an expected cost for the projects.
Sometimes, the best move you make is the one you don't.
If Major League Baseball had moved Game 4 of the Atlanta-Houston league division series from Sunday afternoon on ESPN to prime time on Fox, it is unlikely that the result would have been the classic that we saw: an 18-inning marathon featuring Roger Clemens's three-inning relief stint and Chris Burke's game-winning home run after 5 hours 50 minutes.
But even if all that had happened, people would have surely squawked at a nearly 2 a.m. finish.
As it was, the Astros' victory provided a stirring, nearly seamless lead-in to Fox's coverage of Game 4 of the American League division series, which the Yankees won over the Angels in a game that had been rained out the day before.
The question raised by the scheduling was why Major League Baseball would accede to Fox's request to carry the Yankees-Angels game, reducing the time the teams had to fly across the country for last night's Game 5.
Fox's contract guaranteed a prime-time game, and the network asked Major League Baseball for the Yankees-Angels game. Why not? The Yankees and the Angels represent the country's largest markets, and Fox, in the penultimate season of a six-year, $2.5 billion deal, covets the games that promise the highest ratings.
M.L.B. said yes without debate because it recognized that the Yankees and the Angels would most likely reach a larger audience.
One might conclude that a Fox-M.L.B. cabal had conspired to give the Yankees and the Angels the airplane crankies, but baseball knows it's in showbiz.
Bob DuPuy, the president of Major League Baseball, also noted that the extra time allowed the Yankee Stadium field a few more hours to dry.
"Weather-wise, if not for travel reasons, it was the right decision, and the weather got better later in the day," he said.
Had the Braves played the Astros in prime time Sunday, they would have had to fly east if a fifth game were needed in that series last night.
"Why would that be better?" DuPuy said, while acknowledging that the flight to Anaheim is longer. He added, "Look, there are always circumstances."
In 1999, DuPuy recalled, Cincinnati waited through nearly six hours of rain delays before beating Milwaukee after midnight in the regular-season finale, then flew home for a one-game playoff the next day against the Mets.
DuPuy sounded a Darwinian note about the exigencies of weather and the playoff schedule.
"Teams fly coast to coast all the time, and they have rain issues," he said. Then he added, "You play with the cards you're dealt."
The scheduling did not hurt viewership. The 9.7 overnight rating for the Yankees-Angels game was 45 percent better than the National League division series game in the same time slot last year. On ESPN, the Atlanta-Houston game produced a 3.8 rating, up 48 percent from their Sunday playoff game last year.
Clash of Philosophies
Watching both games Sunday provided a way to see how differently Fox and ESPN use close-ups to convey action and drama, not to mention the slow growth of facial hair.
Fox's game direction has always used the tight close-up, a practice that escalates in the late innings as tension increases. Fox's close-ups are so tight that sinus cavities are nearly visible.
ESPN is more subtle, rarely zooming in for the tight shave. While ESPN prefers a medium close-up, from the waist up, Fox zeroes in on pores, whiskers and skin conditions. ESPN is not nearly as interested in dermatological matters, but it might have to change if it starts to market Berman face cream, which, given the manifest destiny of ESPN, seems inevitable.
A survey of the final three innings of Sunday's broadcasts showed a chasm in the frequency of close-ups, which was partly a consequence of the speed of the games and the number of pitches thrown. Yet the count was startlingly different. Fox had a total of 154. ESPN had 38.
ESPN did not seek tension entirely on the mugs of pitchers and batters. It often cut to lengthy fan-reaction shots, and it used various cameras around Minute Maid Park, including long views of the field from above the baselines. Whereas virtually every pitch on Fox started with at least one pitcher close-up, regardless of their expressions, ESPN was more eclectic in its shot selection, starting pitch sequences from many angles.
ESPN sometimes seems a little distant, while Fox closes in so tightly that pitchers don't seem to have limbs. There is probably a perfect solution in the middle of the two styles.
Some Speak Out, Some Won't
Some managers evidently believe there are better things to do than wear headsets to speak to the networks during playoff games. The Yankees' Joe Torre does it, but the Angels' Mike Scioscia does not.
Tim Mead, an Angels spokesman, said in an e-mail message that Scioscia "strongly believes in providing 100 percent, undivided attention to the game and the issues and decisions involved."
The Braves' Bobby Cox and the Astros' Phil Garner didn't wear headsets, but the White Sox' Ozzie Guillen and the Red Sox' Terry Francona did, and they were usually the most entertaining. The Cardinals' Tony La Russa did it, but the Padres' Bruce Bochy did not.

NEW ORLEANS, Oct. 12 - "I went down to St. James Infirmary/Saw my baby there/Stretched out on a long white table/So sweet, so cold, so fair."
If this tune, made famous by Louis Armstrong, happens to be a favorite of your local coroner, then either you are alarmed, or you are from New Orleans.
If your coroner also plays the trumpet, is known as Dr. Jazz, and marches in funeral processions wearing a white suit, then he is Dr. Frank Minyard, a living illustration of the intimate connection between music and death in New Orleans.
Dr. Minyard, who has been the elected coroner of Orleans Parish since 1974, has dealt with capsized riverboats, plane crashes, frequent murders and police brutality investigations. On the slab in his basement morgue, he has seen friends and mayors and people who were both.
Now, he has met his greatest challenge: the hundreds of bodies collected from New Orleans and its neighboring parishes since Hurricane Katrina.
At 76, on the brink of a retirement that was supposed to combine oyster dinners at his favorite restaurants with a simple life on his cattle farm on the north shore of Lake Pontchartrain, Dr. Minyard has found himself living in an R.V. on the grounds of a temporary federal morgue in St. Gabriel, a small town just outside Baton Rouge, grappling with the still-increasing death toll, the bewildering red tape and the urgent calls of bereaved families.
The process of identifying Hurricane Katrina's victims has been criticized as painfully slow, and amid the parceling of blame state officials have accused Dr. Minyard of obstructing the process by declining offers of help despite a staff decimated by displacement and layoffs.
It is criticism he shrugs off, saying in an interview, "If they need someone to point the finger at, that's O.K. with me." Sometimes he views the current challenge as the natural culmination of his life.
"This is something that I was just destined to do," he says.
Other times, he sounds less certain, as on a recent day when he paid a rare visit to his French Quarter apartment. Above the sofa, against the baroque burgundy wallpaper, were photographs of Duke Dejan, Milton Batiste, Danny Barker and other musical mentors, and a blow-up of a snapshot that has become the popular Dr. Jazz souvenir shop poster -- and once, during his only contested election, was a campaign sign.
It shows Dr. Minyard circa 1980, standing on the levee in his white suit, playing the trumpet. Of the people on the wall, he is the only one still living.
"God has given me this swan song," he said, "to see if I am -- to see if I am up to it."
In the kind of twist that might strike New Orleanians as perfectly natural, their coroner began his medical career as an obstetrician. Before that, he was a tall, blue-eyed pretty boy: a lifeguard in the summers and, once, second runner-up in a Mr. New Orleans bodybuilding contest. During medical school, he said, he spent his summers in New York City giving "nightlife tours."
By the late 1960's, Dr. Minyard had a successful practice, a family, a tennis court and a swimming pool, beside which he was sitting one day when he heard Peggy Lee singing, "Is that all there is?"
"Prior to that I was very selfish, like most young doctors and lawyers and dentists," said Dr. Minyard, who gave up his private medical practice soon after he became coroner. "I was just trying to get the Cadillac and the country club membership."
His pursuit of the coroner's office had nothing to do with the dead and everything to do with Sister Mary David Young, a Catholic educator who ran a breakfast program for poor children and called Dr. Minyard for fund-raising help.
"She told me, 'The mothers of these kids, they're all prostitutes and shoplifters,"' Dr. Minyard recalled. "I said, 'Well Sister, nobody's perfect."'
But it was worse than that. Some of the women were heroin addicts, and to help them Dr. Minyard and Sister Mary David eventually founded what he says was the city's first methadone clinic. Soon, he wanted to give methadone to addicts in jail, and learned that in Louisiana, whose legal system is based on the Napoleonic Code, the coroner was responsible for the medical care of prisoners. The coroner at the time opposed methadone treatment for inmates, Dr. Minyard said.
The first time Dr. Minyard ran, in 1969, he lost to the incumbent. But four years later, he and a slate of other candidates viewed as reformers -- including Harry Connick Sr., the "Singing D.A." -- were swept into office. Another of those candidates, Edwin Lombard, now a state appeals court judge, recalled his befuddlement the first time he saw Dr. Minyard campaign: "I said, 'This guy's a nut.' He's walking through the audience blowing the trumpet -- off-key, too."
As a child, Dr. Minyard learned to play the trumpet by ear. His mother and grandmother were ragtime piano players. His father was descended, he says, from one of two Minyard brothers who were sprung from the Bastille at the onset of the French Revolution.
"I never did learn how they got into prison," he said. "They were probably thieves and cutthroats." His parents met on a riverboat.
In a city obsessed with heritage and hijinks, this history helps make Dr. Minyard a classic character. "In any other city," he says, "I couldn't be elected dog catcher."
Instead of pursuing a career in music, Dr. Minyard went to medical school at Louisiana State University. He did not pick up a trumpet again until his late 30's, when he was guest on a radio talk show answering medical questions and his mother called to say she was having his old horn refurbished for his 12-year-old son.
His mother was unaware that their conversation was being broadcast, and it led to an invitation for Dr. Minyard to come back and play.
The recital was not a critical success.
"Pete Fountain called in and said, 'If that's music, I'm going to shoot myself because I don't want to be associated with it,"' Dr. Minyard said.
However inexpert his playing, Dr. Minyard became devoted to jazz, and soon he was sitting in with the venerated Olympia Brass Band and hiring musicians as morgue assistants to help them make ends meet. In his first year as coroner, he was arrested while playing in the French Quarter to protest a crackdown on street musicians.
As he likes to tell it, the judge told him to do something constructive with his trumpet, so he started Jazz Roots, an annual concert featuring the city's musical royalty that has raised $800,000 for city charities over the past 30 years. It is advertised on the coroner's Web site, along with a sample of Dr. Minyard's trumpet playing.
"In 31 years I've had nothing but happiness in a job that deals with unhappiness," Dr. Minyard said over a truck-stop lunch near the morgue. He has dined with Fats Domino and played the trumpet for Mike Wallace. Once, on the airport tarmac, Pope John Paul II blessed his trumpet.
But lately, things have been grim. When the flooding began, Dr. Minyard tried to swim to his office, and ended up marooned there four days. The process of identifying Hurricane Katrina's victims may take more than a year to complete. And though his own property and family were largely spared by the storm, the vast majority of Louisiana's 1,035 dead are what he calls "my people."
A few weeks ago, when he had a moment alone, the coroner took out his trumpet and played a tune he had played hundreds of times before. "Do you know what it means," his horn sang, "to miss New Orleans?"
This time, he said, the song made him cry.
The Chicago White Sox and the Houston Astros weren't popular enough to stop the housewives and surgeons on Sunday night. ABC's "Desperate Housewives" (24.86 million) and "Grey's Anatomy" (18.41 million) pulled up the network's prime-time average in Nielsen's estimates, lifting its ratings above Fox's broadcast of Game 2 of the World Series (approximately 15.51 million). ABC has won every Sunday of the fall season so far among all viewers and among adults 18 to 49. A year ago, it was a different story: the Boston Red Sox-St. Louis Cardinals game drew nearly 10 million more viewers than this Sunday's matchup, and Fox carried the night. For NBC, "The West Wing" (7.77 million) continued to have ratings troubles, as its White House leak story line came to a head. (Toby, played by Richard Schiff, did it.) Formerly top-rated, "The West Wing" finished fourth among both total viewers and 18- to 49-year-olds, as did NBC over all on Sunday. CBS was third. KATE AURTHUR
Reaching into a core constituency of his opponent, Fernando Ferrer, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg attended an East Harlem rally of cheering Latino supporters yesterday and said that he had received the endorsement of Jorge Santini-Padilla, the mayor of San Juan, Puerto Rico.
Mr. Bloomberg's display of Latino support came on a day when Mr. Ferrer, who is of Puerto Rican descent, struggled to shore up his campaign in the final days before Tuesday's election.
Mr. Ferrer, who has been overwhelmingly outspent by the mayor, got a financial boost yesterday when the Campaign Finance Board, in a final payment of matching funds, awarded him $1,007,176.
Mr. Ferrer spent much of the day campaigning in Manhattan, with appearances before a group of adult students at Hartley House on West 46th Street and before low-income people at the Second Providence Baptist Church on West 116th Street, where he focused on rising poverty among city residents.
Separately, the Democratic State Committee, which has repeatedly accused Mr. Bloomberg of being in denial of his Republican Party affiliation, sought to draw Gov. George E. Pataki into its line of attack. In a news release, it said the mayor "is running away from George Pataki" and cited as evidence the mayor's absence from the governor's side yesterday when Mr. Pataki campaigned in the city with a City Council candidate.
"Republican Michael Bloomberg was proud to support George Pataki when it benefited him politically, so why won't he stand with his good friend today?" said the state committee's chairman, Herman D. Farrell Jr., a Manhattan assemblyman.
Stu Loeser, a campaign spokesman for the mayor, denied that Mr. Bloomberg was avoiding the governor and said that the possibility of a joint appearance had not been discussed. Mr. Pataki maintains an office in Manhattan and visits the city frequently for appearances that do not include the mayor.
Governor Pataki, asked yesterday to comment on the mayoral race, said Mr. Bloomberg was right to concentrate on his own campaign. "He is focused on being with the grass-roots people in every neighborhood," the governor said. "That's the right thing to do."
Mr. Bloomberg's appearance late yesterday at the rally of Latino voters, conducted at Patsy's Pizzeria in East Harlem, followed a morning appearance at City College. There, he delivered a speech in which he sought to distill his first-term accomplishments and proposals into a structured mayoral agenda.
He was introduced at the morning appearance by the Rev. Calvin O. Butts 3rd of the Abyssinian Baptist Church in Harlem, who has been a vocal advocate of Mr. Bloomberg's re-election. Mr. Butts said that Mr. Bloomberg had risen above party politics in his first term, dealt effectively with the entire city, and "set a new paradigm for what politics might be like in the 21st century."
But Mr. Bloomberg's City College speech, in which he claimed to have laid out "100 new ideas to continue to move our city forward" in a second term, was not entirely above traditional stump politics. While never mentioning Mr. Ferrer by name, the mayor returned to themes he had pushed aggressively in their debate on Tuesday, when he suggested that Mr. Ferrer was a complainer who is unprepared to solve the city's ills.
"It's easy to point out problems," Mr. Bloomberg said yesterday. "I focus on solutions." He added, "Real leadership doesn't waver and complaints don't drive down crime, create jobs or fix schools."
Besides Mr. Santini-Padilla, Mr. Bloomberg was endorsed yesterday by three members of Puerto Rico's House of Representatives, who attended the East Harlem rally, and by Roberto Clemente Jr., a real estate broker, radio personality and the son of the revered major-league outfielder.
Mr. Santini-Padilla, who did not attend the rally, was quoted in a news release prepared by the mayor's campaign as saying that many Puerto Ricans admired Mr. Bloomberg's record during his first term.
"The Hispanic communities, especially the many generations of Puerto Ricans who live in the city and whose families are my constituents, recognize your work," Mr. Santini-Padilla said.
Campaign advisers to Mr. Ferrer responded by saying that he maintained a broad base of support among Latinos, including the governor of Puerto Rico, Aníbal Acevedo-Vilá, who has visited New York to campaign with Mr. Ferrer.
"Freddy Ferrer is proud to have the support of literally dozens of Latino leaders," said Jen Bluestein, his chief spokeswoman.
WHITE PLAINS, Nov. 8 - Donald Trump became a few million dollars richer on Tuesday when he won a lawsuit against a construction company he accused of overcharging him for work at a golf course.
Mr. Trump had sued Columbus Construction Corporation of Mount Vernon, N.Y., claiming it billed him for $1.5 million more than he owed for excavation work during construction of the Trump National Golf Club and homes in Briarcliff Manor, N.Y.He claimed damages for workers having left the job site, failing to complete the work and causing losses in golf course revenue and residential sales.
In a decision released on Tuesday, Justice Kenneth Rudolph of State Supreme Court awarded $2.1 million in damages, 9 percent interest over four years, and legal fees that are still to be determined. Mr. Scharf said it would total about $4 million.
Vanessa Haydon, a daughter of Bonnie Kay Haydon of New York and the late Charles Haydon, was married yesterday to Donald J. Trump Jr., a son of Ivana M. Trump and Donald J. Trump, both of New York. Judge Maryanne Trump Barry of the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit, an aunt of the bridegroom, officiated at Mar-a-Lago in Palm Beach, Fla., where the bridegroom's family has a home.
Mrs. Trump, 27, is a fashion model at Next Model Management in New York. She has appeared in television commercials and had a role in the movie "Something's Gotta Give." She is studying for a bachelor's degree in psychology at Marymount College in New York. Her father was a lawyer in New York.
Mr. Trump, also 27, graduated from the University of Pennsylvania. He is the vice president for development and acquisitions at the Trump Organization, in New York, where his father is the chairman and president. The bridegroom's mother founded two companies in New York: Ivana Inc., which handles her speaking engagements, books and other commercial ventures; and Ivana Haute Couture, which sells jewelry, sunglasses and clothing on cable television.
The bridegroom is a stepson of Melania Trump.

For a funny guy, Jon Stewart is starting to collect some serious prizes. Stewart, David Javerbaum and Ben Karlin won the 2005 Thurber Prize for American Humor for their book, "The Daily Show With Jon Stewart Presents America (The Book): A Citizen's Guide to Democracy Inaction." The runners-up were Andy Borowitz for "The Borowitz Report: The Big Book of Shockers" and Firoozeh Dumas for "Funny in Farsi: A Memoir of Growing up Iranian in America." The award, considered the nation's top award for humor writing, is named for James Thurber, an author, humorist and New Yorker magazine cartoonist who delighted readers for decades with his sharp wit and literary flair before his death in 1961. Stewart is the host of Comedy Central's "The Daily Show With Jon Stewart," which has earned seven Emmys and a George Foster Peabody Award. (AP)
Lewis Lapham, the editor of Harper's Magazine for nearly 30 years, has announced that he will retire as editor in the spring. Lapham, who is 70, said he would take on the title of editor emeritus and would continue to write his "Notebook" column on a regular basis. He is under contract to write a book about President William Howard Taft. He said in an interview that he might also write at least two other books, one about the second half of the 20th century and the other about his family, which arrived on American shores from Britain in the 1630s. He said he expected a new editor would be named within a month and that the person would retain the character of Harper's, a 155-year-old monthly. (AP)
Kazakhstan's Foreign Ministry has threatened "legal action" against the British comedian Sacha Baron Cohen, who wins laughs by portraying the Central Asian state as a country populated by drunks who enjoy cow-punching as a sport. Baron Cohen, who portrays a fictitious Kazakh television host, Borat, in his "Da Ali G Show," has won fame ridiculing Kazakhstan. Baron Cohen appears to have drawn official Kazakh ire after he served as host of the annual MTV Europe Music Awards show in Lisbon earlier this month, when Borat arrived aboard an "Air Kazakh" propeller plane controlled by a one-eyed pilot clutching a vodka bottle. "We do not rule out that Mr. Cohen is serving someone's political order designed to present Kazakhstan and its people in a derogatory way," a Kazakh Foreign Ministry spokesman, Yerzhan Ashykbayev, said at a news briefing. "We reserve the right to any legal action to prevent new pranks of the kind." He declined to elaborate.(Reuters)
NBC television executives have acknowledged that the network would not produce any further editions of the Martha Stewart version of "The Apprentice," reality show but said it had never intended to do so, so that did not mean the show was canceled. The American show, which has five episodes left to run, has posted mainly meager ratings. Mark Burnett, the executive producer of Stewart's "Apprentice" show and her daily show as well as the popular reality show "Survivor," said that he and NBC had agreed before the "The Apprentice" show started that Stewart "could not possibly do another prime-time show" because of her other television commitments and her other businesses. "The 'Apprentice' deal was made to reintroduce Martha to the television landscape," he said. The original "Apprentice," starring Donald Trump, will continue to air. (NYT)
Madonna was scheduled to play a live set Tuesday night at the London club where she first appeared in Britain 22 years ago. The American singer, now 47 and married to the British film director Guy Ritchie, planned to perform five songs at the Koko Club - formerly the Camden Palace - where she gave her first live British performance in 1983. The performance was designed to promote her new album "Confessions on a Dance Floor," which critics are calling a return to the singer's disco roots. The invited audience was expected to include 1,500 fans, made up mainly of competition winners. (BBC)

The Fall North American Bridge Championships begin this afternoon in the Adam's Mark hotel in Denver and run through Nov. 27. The premier event is the Reisinger Board-a-Match Teams, the defending champions being Nick Nickell, Dick Freeman, Bob Hamman, Paul Soloway, Jeff Meckstroth and Eric Rodwell. Full details can be found at www.acbl.org.
Alan Truscott, the late bridge columnist for this newspaper, was the declarer on the diagramed deal from last year's Fall Nationals, as they are commonly called, in Orlando. He was the victim of a good defensive play by Mike Shuman, sitting West.
South's takeout double is a minimum, and it would be preferable if the heart ace were the diamond ace. Usually it is better to have honors in your long suits, not in your short suits. West pre-empted with three hearts. If he had had the values for a game-invitational limit raise, he would have responded two no-trump, a bid invented by Truscott. (Over a takeout double, two no-trump is not needed in a natural sense. With a balanced hand, fewer than four hearts and 10-plus points, West would start with redouble.) North cue-bid four hearts to show a strong hand and at least two places to play. He hoped that if South did not have four spades, five diamonds would be all right. (Three no-trump can be made, but it requires X-ray vision.)
West led a heart. Declarer won with his ace, played a trump to dummy, and discarded two of his diamond losers on the king-queen of hearts. Now came a diamond to East's queen. He continued with the diamond king, which South ruffed. Declarer ran the club jack, losing to East's queen and giving this position:
East led the club ace. Notice what happens if he wins the trick. He must exit with a heart or a club and declarer can take the rest of the tricks. He scores either five spade tricks (if permitted a ruff with dummy's spade three) or four spades and the club ten (if West ruffs in to stop the spade three from scoring). But Shuman, seeing what was threatened and breaking a cardinal rule of bridge, ruffed his partner's ace and returned a trump. This left Truscott a trick short, but he had a good story that he gave to the editors of the daily bulletins at the tournament.
Just before the lights dimmed in the Rose Theater on Thursday night, a voice announced that while the use of cellphones was prohibited, hand-clapping, foot-stomping and cries of "Aw, yeah!" were all welcome forms of audience participation. It was a hokier introduction than one might have expected from a concert called "Wynton With Strings." But in a way, it suited both subject and setting.
Wynton Marsalis has built his legend on the premise of an elevated yet approachable music -- America's Classical Music, let's say, but also an incorrigibly down-home gumbo. His primary instrument, aside from the trumpet, has been the apparatus of Jazz at Lincoln Center, which employs him as artistic director in much the same way that Apple employs Steve Jobs as chief executive. "Wynton With Strings" arrived several days after the organization's fall gala, a black-tie affair that celebrated Mr. Marsalis's 25-year solo career, and reportedly raised nearly $2 million.
There's a certain middlebrow pleasure in the soloist-plus-strings equation, which most famously yielded recordings by Charlie Parker and Clifford Brown. Mr. Marsalis's Columbia albums in this vein -- "Hot House Flowers" in 1984 and "Standard Time, Vol. 5: The Midnight Blues" in 1998 -- self-consciously strove for a more harmonious marriage of orchestration and improvisation. The arrangements from those albums, by Robert Freedman, were the chief substance of the concert, which featured Mr. Marsalis with his quintet and a string orchestra conducted by Robert Sadin.
At best, the music fulfilled its implicit promise of romance. "For All We Know" and "Spring Will Be a Little Late This Year," which both came in the stronger second half, provided Mr. Marsalis with vehicles for wistful Technicolor balladry, and he indulged without going overboard. "Stardust," with its darkly tremulous arrangement, was even more powerful, and it elicited Mr. Marsalis's most unassumingly virtuosic performance -- though he was nearly eclipsed by the tenor saxophonist Walter Blanding Jr., who used Ben Webster's crooning tone as a touchstone in the evening's most gallant entreaty.
During other moments, an identity crisis appeared to take hold. "Guess I'll Hang My Tears Out to Dry" was a hodgepodge, alternating between a chromatic pedal point and a strangely unrelated slow swing section. "Django" began with appealing grandeur but gave way to a basic blues. The orchestra and the quintet never felt like a single entity, despite the fact that Mr. Sadin, when he wasn't sculpturing air with his hands, often turned to the band to stomp his feet (he'd heard the announcement) or approvingly grimace and grunt.
Such jubilation felt warranted on a pair of small-group pieces: Mr. Marsalis's recent ditties "Free to Be" and "Big Fat Hen." But several blasts from his past -- "Caravan," "Just Friends" and "Cherokee" -- featured the strings in dimensionless arrangements that merely overlaid the quintet. Mr. Marsalis sounded as crisp and confident as ever; the bright young talent in his band seemed hampered by all the fuss.
"Wynton With Strings" repeats tonight at 8 at Rose Theater, Frederick P. Rose Hall, 60th Street and Broadway, (212) 751-6500.
Barbara Corcoran, below left, who founded the Corcoran Group, one of the city's best-known real estate firms, sued Donald J. Trump yesterday for nearly $1.3 million in commissions related to the developer's West Side project, once known as Riverside South or Trump Place. Ms. Corcoran and two brokers say Mr. Trump agreed to pay them a $4 million commission in 1994 for finding a group of Hong Kong investors to invest in his project. But Richard C. Seltzer, a lawyer for Ms. Corcoran, said Mr. Trump had paid only $2.7 million, despite the sale of the project this year for $1.76 billion. Mr. Trump, who is now suing his Hong Kong partners, called the suit a "ridiculous" publicity ploy by Ms. Corcoran, "who no one cares about."
CHARLES V. BAGLI (NYT)
You open with one heart or one spade, your left-hand opponent makes a takeout double and your partner jumps to two no-trump. What does that response mean? Does it have a name?
In Thursday's column, I mentioned that Stayman was devised independently by Jack Marx of London and George Rapée of New York, not by Sam Stayman.
Takeout doubles were also conceived by two different players: Bryant McCampbell of St. Louis and Maj. Charles Patton of New York.
The auction mentioned at the beginning is wrongly called Jordan in some quarters. It is correctly known as Truscott in other areas because it was first recommended by Alan Truscott, my predecessor on this column for 41 years.
If the responder has a natural two-no-trump response, showing a balanced hand, he would always start with a redouble over the opponent's takeout double. This frees two no-trump for an alternate interpretation, and Truscott had the admirable idea that it should show a game-invitational raise of partner's major suit with at least four-card support. The responder says that he would have made a limit raise over a pass -- for example, one heart/pass/three hearts. So he will probably have 9 to 11 high-card points.
Why is it called Jordan? Because Robert Jordan read about it, liked it and made it popular. Since Truscott was still living in England at that time, Americans assumed it was Jordan's invention, although he has always explained that this was not so.
What do you do with a game-forcing raise and four-card-or-better support? By partnership agreement, you can respond three no-trump, or bid two no-trump, planning to raise to game if partner signs off in three of your suit.
This artificial use of two no-trump has a secondary advantage in that a jump raise over a double -- for example, one spade/double/three spades -- may be made with a weak hand containing four-card support but fewer values than are needed for a limit raise. (Responder will usually have 4 to 8 high-card points.)
What does the responder do opposite a minor-suit opening bid? Tune in on Monday.
In the diagramed deal, North responds two no-trump over West's double to show his limit raise of spades. South takes a shot at game. What should happen in four spades with best play on both sides?
With an unattractive lead, West selects a trump. This almost certainly marks him with the heart ace, since without that card, he probably would have led a heart. If that is the case and East ever gets on lead to push through a heart, South will lose two hearts, one diamond and one club. If East can be kept off play, though, South has 10 potential tricks in five spades, two diamonds and three clubs.
South draws trumps and leads a diamond. West wins with his ace and exits with a diamond. Declarer takes his second diamond trick, plays a club to his ace, and leads another club. When West plays low, South must rise with dummy's club queen and lead another club, establishing the last club on the board and endplaying West.
But if West started with four clubs to the king-jack, declarer would have to put in dummy's club ten, return to hand with a trump, and lead his remaining club through West toward dummy's queen.
With that defense, West gave declarer a guess. But West has a no-cost attempt to defeat the contract. He should throw the club king under South's ace. Here, that is successful. East must get in with his club jack and can make the killing heart shift.
WINDSOR, England, Dec. 21 - If there were any demonstrators in the crowd, either pro- or anti-gay, they were being unusually quiet. No one was screaming religious slogans, carrying angry placards, wearing in-your-face outfits or loudly forecasting the end of civilization as we know it.
The most striking thing, in fact, about the people gathered along the streets here on Wednesday for Sir Elton John's civil partnership ceremony with his boyfriend, David Furnish, was how little they appeared to care, one way or the other, about the couple's sexuality.
"They're all doing it now, aren't they?" said 55-year-old Margaret Gray, who described herself as a fan of Sir Elton, particularly his song "Candle in the Wind."
"I think he's been open about everything, bless him, and I'm pleased for him."
Down the street, Rita Divico, 59, said of homosexuality that "it's not something that's in my nature." But each to his own, she added.
"If that's what they want to do, it's up to them," said Mrs. Divico, who was born in Italy and is a Roman Catholic. "If it makes them happy, carry on." She herself has been married for 42 years, she said, "too long."
Sir Elton, 58, and Mr. Furnish, 43, have lived together since 1994, after meeting at a mutual friend's dinner party, but they have been legally prevented from making honest men of each other. That changed on Wednesday, when Britain's new civil partnership law took effect in England, allowing gay couples to legalize their relationships.
The law was passed in 2004 and has been taking effect in different parts of Britain this week, starting in Northern Ireland on Monday. The government said that 687 gay couples had registered their intention to make their partnerships official on Wednesday, and that as many as 22,000 couples might take advantage of the new law in the next five years.
Although it stops short of calling the new arrangement marriage, unlike in the Netherlands, Canada, Spain and Belgium, the legislation gives gay couples legal rights similar to those of married people in areas like inheritance, immigration and pensions, as well as responsibilities in areas like child-rearing.
Sir Elton, long one of British show business's best-loved figures, is not known for his low-key approach to anything, and, after an early and unsuccessful marriage to a woman, he has never made a secret of his homosexuality. In concert, he wears enormous kooky sunglasses, platform shoes, glitter and, on one occasion, a chicken costume; he once admitted to spending £290,000 (about $512,000 at current rates) on flowers in an 18-month period.
He has a decidedly common touch that he solidified when he sang "Candle in the Wind" at the funeral of Diana, the Princess of Wales. But Sir Elton is also a celebrity's celebrity, offering counseling and refuge in his many homes to famous friends who are addicted to drugs or other substances, unhappy in love or, in the case of Elizabeth Hurley, eager to lose the weight they gained while pregnant. He is a darling of celebrity magazines and reportedly turned down a multimillion-pound offer for the media rights to the event.
On Wednesday, he kept it dignified, arriving for the service at the Guildhall, in the shadow of Windsor Castle, wearing a dark suit and a diamond pin. Mr. Furnish, who is Canadian and makes films, also wore a dark suit.
The Guildhall is the same place, as it happens, where Prince Charles and Camilla Parker Bowles were married last spring. But while the royal couple went on to have a blessing in church and a reception at the castle sponsored by Queen Elizabeth, the nonroyals skipped the church (Church of England clergy members are not allowed to perform gay partnership ceremonies, anyway) and prepared for a big party, without the queen but probably with better food, at their house in Old Windsor.
Only a select few guests attended the Guildhall ceremony. Among those present were Mr. Furnish's black-and-white spaniel, Arthur, and the photographer Sam Taylor-Wood, who later described the ceremony as "beautiful" and "very emotional." Guests said the 20-minute service ended with a kiss.
The parents of both grooms were also there. Mr. Furnish's mother, Gladys, told reporters afterward that she was "very proud." His father, Fred, said it was "one of the happiest days of my life."
Mr. Furnish and Sir Elton emerged from the Guildhall beaming, to cheers from onlookers. Although they did not kiss outside, robbing the tabloid photographers of the photograph of the day, they blew kisses at the crowd before sweeping into a black car and driving off. Sir Elton mouthed the words "I love you" in the general direction of the well-wishers.
At his monthly news conference at Downing Street, Prime Minister Tony Blair sent his congratulations.
"I wish him and David well, and all the other people exercising their rights under the civil partnerships law," Mr. Blair said. "I think it is a modern, progressive step for the country, and I am proud we did it."
Not everyone feels that way.
Stephen Green, national director of Christian Voice, a group that wants to put religion at the forefront of politics and whose Web site displays the phrase "the enemies of God are all having their say," told The Press Association that "ordinary people will be revolted by the sight of these couples embracing."
He continued, speaking of the new legislation, "The recognition in our law of what the Bible describes as an abomination and vile affection will bring judgment on our land from the same Almighty God who destroyed Sodom and Gomorrah."
Outside the Guildhall, Gloria Pugh and her husband, John, were not thinking about Sodom or Gomorrah. They just wanted to see Sir Elton, and any other celebrity who happened to be in the neighborhood.
"As long as they don't bother me, I'm not bothered," Mr. Pugh, 61, said of gay couples.
In fact, he added, Mrs. Pugh has a gay uncle who has been with his own partner for many years. Because of the new law, the family is wondering whether the couple will make it legal.
Miles Davis "The Cellar Door Sessions, 1970" (Sony Legacy)
Except to the few jazz experts who have looked at it aerially and mapped it out, Miles Davis's first electric period, from 1969 to 1975, feels like a dark labyrinth, or a frustration dream. He worked hard, and created a body of recorded work that was caustic, unrecognizable, spooky. In spots, the passageways become tiny and dark; waves of musicians, hired for an hour or a month or a year, fade in and out, all subsumed by rhythm. The sound balloons, growing dense and disjunctive and bluntly repetitive, and then winnows down to an ominous rustle.
But "The Cellar Door Sessions, 1970," a new six-CD box set full of live Miles Davis music, represents a stretch when Davis was making organic, linear music. It is six musicians in a working band, making sense of a new paradigm on a nightclub stage in Washington, from a Wednesday to a Saturday. Along with Davis on trumpet, they are the keyboardist Keith Jarrett, the saxophonist Gary Bartz, the bassist Michael Henderson, the drummer Jack DeJohnette and the percussionist Airto Moreira. By the end of the week, joined by the guitarist John McLaughlin, the band grows to seven.
About 80 minutes of this music was used on the 1971 album "Live-Evil," and the rest appears here for the first time. The performances follow the principles of jazz as we all know it, with rigorous collective improvisation building up arcs of tension. But the sounds and the rhythms connote another discipline altogether: electric funk, shocked and altered through wah-wah and distortion pedals.
One of the assumptions that Davis was stepping on -- with help from his producer, Teo Macero -- was that there needed to be a stratified difference between performance and studio recordings. Columbia, his label, was already in the practice of recording many of his gigs. But the trumpeter and the producer didn't want to just make live albums: they became wickedly creative with the editing razor, making collages with completely different songs from live tapes and even studio jams. Some of the final products could be wrenching, discontinuous, provocative. But they were only emphasizing the provocations already there.
By the time of "Cellar Door," Davis was scraping off the outer levels of the sound that made him famous, masking and distorting his instrument. It wasn't just that he wouldn't play "Bye Bye Blackbird" anymore; suddenly he wasn't making the trumpet sound like a trumpet. At times, on "Cellar Door," the electric guitar sounds like a keyboard, which sounds like a trumpet, which sounds like a percussion instrument -- specifically, the cuíca, the Brazilian friction drum that whines and sighs as it changes pitch. As much as Davis alters himself, you hear his phrases, and even his tone, at the core of that changed sound. It's still him.
In everyday terms, this box set is too much music. One of these discs alone, perhaps the second or the sixth, can be nearly overwhelming; each demands concentration. But for now that's beside the point. It's filling a hole in general knowledge, and it establishes better than before that there was, in fact, a third great Miles Davis group beyond the quintets of the 1950's and 60's.
Through each complete live set, the members of the band are listening rigorously to one other and Davis is working to build something coherent for his audience. In "Honky Tonk," he pulls that coherence across a slow, tense ooze; in "Directions" and "What I Say," the band plays fast and athletically, with Mr. DeJohnette coming on the second and fourth beat, and Mr. Henderson leaving space between short, wriggling bass figures. Jimi Hendrix had died three months before these shows, and sometimes Davis seems to be trying to keep pace with the sound of Hendrix's Band of Gypsies. (Several bass lines refer directly to a few Hendrix songs that were not even a year old.)
Mr. Bartz keeps the music earthy, with blues-tonality phrases. Mr. McLaughlin, with his bright, slashing fusillades, shows up on the two final discs, and "Live-Evil" tilted toward his presence. Yet he wasn't strictly necessary. The central force in the band, beneath Davis's imposing gestures, is Mr. Jarrett, battling with two Fender keyboards: an electric piano and an organ.
As Mr. Jarrett writes in the box set's liner notes, he abominated both instruments, but asked to play one or the other, he decided to play them simultaneously, and through effects pedals, to sound as unkeyboardlike as he could. His performances are stunning: he pulls the music taut, elaborates in long, aggressive sweeps on the short written motives and the harmonies, tirelessly explores the instruments' porridgey noises, making notes splat and shriek and tinkle. He doesn't let up. He has four discrete solo improvisations on the set, but you can drop in nearly anywhere and see for yourself: he's thinking orchestrally, making a great deal happen at once. BEN RATLIFF

SHANGHAI — There are only 10 known billionaires in China, and he is one of them. His name is Xu Rongmao, and he is no Donald Trump. He is bigger.
Xu, who is the chairman of the Shimao Group, controls much more land than any private developer in the United States and builds luxury real estate projects that put Trump to shame for their sheer scale and flamboyance.
But unlikeTrump, who is never at a loss for words and who goes out of his way to attract photographers, Xu almost never grants interviews and is highly secretive about his operations.
But for all his reserve, Xu, a former textile factory worker, is one of China's wealthiest entrepreneurs and a prime example of the mainland's first generation of real estate tycoons.
"I don't know much about Xu, but Shimao has this uncanny ability to find the right projects at the right time," said Michael Hart, director of research in Shanghai at Jones Lang Lasalle. "Their north Bund project has one of the best views in all of Shanghai."
In a country that started allowing people to buy homes only in the 1980s, developers like Xu (pronounced "Shew") found a way to acquire rights to prime land in the country's biggest cities. Now they are reaping huge profits by building large residential projects, often mixed with hotels and other commercial buildings.
An industry that emerged only a decade ago suddenly has annual sales of $130 billion, making real estate one of the biggest engines in the Chinese economy.
The growth has helped propel Xu to No. 9 on Forbes's list of the richest people in China. With $1 billion in assets, he runs two publicly listed real estate companies and a collection of private, offshore companies and is now overseeing $9 billion in projects. Shimao Group is expected to complete building about 13.5 million square meters, or 145 million square feet, of property by 2010.
By all accounts, Xu - who is also known as Hui Wing Mau, the Cantonese rendering of his name - is a pioneer, willing to take big gambles. Through Shimao, he created one of the country's first luxury real estate brands. He bought prime land in Shanghai in the late 1990s when others, fearing that the city was becoming overbuilt, were fleeing the market.
Now, with housing prices rising, the Shimao Group is so profitable that Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley are negotiating to take the company public in 2006.
Several of China's other real estate tycoons share Xu's rags-to-riches saga. The developer of Shanghai's stylish new Citigroup building, for example, was once a truck driver from impoverished Jiangxi Province.
Little is known about Xu, 55, particularly about how he earned his early fortune and developed his network of powerful political allies, who include several high-ranking Communist Party officials.He turned down repeated requests for an interview for this article, as did many other major Chinese developers. Some acknowledged that they simply did not want publicity and scrutiny in a country that is still officially communist and uneasy about the creation of individual wealth.
"The nail that sticks up gets hammered," said Jack J.T. Huang, chairman of Asia for the law firm Jones Day, citing a common Chinese saying that is also popular in Japan and elsewhere in Asia. "No one wants to be that nail and talk about this kind of business."
Perhaps for good reason. The Chinese real estate industry has been dogged by scandal, with tales of illegal land grabs, corruption, government bribery, shoddy construction and the forced relocation of millions of peasants and urban poor.
Yet almost everyone with means in China these days seems to want to play the real estate game. Of the 50 richest Chinese, according to Forbes's rankings in 2005, half rely on real estate as one of their primary businesses.
People who have worked with Xu, a sprightly looking man with well-groomed black hair, say that he leaped to the top after he bought a collection of distressed properties in Shanghai in the late 1990s and began developing a massive riverfront development in the Pudong district, where some apartments now sell for more than $4 million.

 CUTE, GOOD-LOOKING STAFF
When your boutique hotel is as gorgeous as a supermodel, the last thing you want is to muck it up with employees who aren't runway material. Or at least that was the thinking behind the chic hotels that materialized during the go-go 1990's. Who cared if the doorman couldn't be bothered to open the door, or the bathroom attendant was too busy checking herself in the mirror to hand you a towel? What mattered was that the staff could complement the hip dÃ©cor like creatures from a Calvin Klein ad. 
The textbook example of this approach was Ian Schrager, the nightclub impresario turned hotelier, who staffed his lobbies like Paris runways. In 1999, the federal Equal Employment Opportunity Commission sued Mr. Schrager for replacing nine bellmen at the Mondrian Hotel in West Hollywood with white Adonises who had been handpicked by Hollywood agents. The case was settled in 2000 for $1.08 million. 
 COMPETENT STAFF
Being attractive still won't get you fired, but not knowing the checkout time might. Guests now demand good service, said Bjorn Hansen, a hotel consultant with PricewaterhouseCoopers. In the 90's, "consumers wanted something extravagant and frivolous," he said. "Today, the focus is on productivity and convenience."
Take the Setai in South Beach, which combines minimalist design with white-glove service. "Our core staff is of largely Asian heritage who have gone to Swiss hotel schools," said Manvinder Puri, the manager of the Setai, which is owned by GHM, a sister company to Amanresorts. "Appearance is important, but it's in the grooming, not in God's will."
 Tim Miller, who spent 16 years as Mr. Schrager's brand manager, is following suit. He recently launched his own anti-boutique chain called Alden Hotels that is everything the Mondrian is not: friendly and attitude-free. 
The tide may have turned when W Hotels introduced the boutique concept to the mass market. Instead of "model types who pose," W staffed its front desk with young, peppy people who might or might not have had headshots, said Ross Klein, president of W Hotels Worldwide. 
"There's a linear definition of strikingly gorgeous and an inclusive one," Mr. Klein said. "Someone who is extremely confident and personally engaging can be considered strikingly gorgeous." 
The major event at the Greater New York Bridge Association's Edgar Kaplan Winter Regional held last week at the Roosevelt Hotel in Manhattan was the Open Board-a-Match Teams. It ended on Friday afternoon with victory for Glenn Milgrim of Forest Hills, Queens; Michael Rosenberg of New Rochelle, N.Y.; Richard Schwartz of East Elmhurst, Queens; and Aaron Silverstein and Chris Willenken of New York. They finished ahead of Franco Baseggio, Martin Fleisher, John Fout, Michael Kopera and Andrew Stark of New York and William Ehlers of West Orange, N.J. Third were Richard Baumer of Holbrook, N.Y.; John Boyer of Hastings-on-Hudson, N.Y.; Robert Kuhnreich of New York; and Robert Stayman of New Rochelle.
In a board-a-match event, when your two pairs compare scores, if you have a net plus on a board, whether it is 10 points or 1,000, you receive one point. If the scores are identical, you get half a point. A loss is worthless.
On the diagramed deal from the final, South for the team that finished fourth ended in two no-trump and went down one. For the winners, Rosenberg was in three no-trump after the given auction. His sequence, a takeout double followed by a minimum rebid in no-trump, showed 19-21 high-card points. North, Willenken, made an aggressive raise to game, expecting his partner accurately to place the missing cards from the revealing bidding.
A diamond lead would have beaten the contract by two tricks, assuming that if declarer plays low from the board, East puts in the nine. But understandably West, Bjorn Fallenius, led the heart seven. Declarer correctly ducked the first trick and took the second heart trick with his ace. South cashed the club ace, dropping East's queen, and continued with the club jack, which West ducked to try to restrict declarer's winners in that suit.
South could have continued with a third club because East, Susan Schnelwar, comes under pressure in three suits. But declarer took a different route. He led the diamond king from his hand. East ducked that to stop South from having a second dummy entry to use to lead spades through East.
Declarer, though, played a heart to dummy's king, led a spade to the jack and king, and exited with a diamond to give this position:
East cashed her two heart tricks, declarer discarding a diamond and a club and dummy releasing two clubs. Now East carefully led the spade nine to hold declarer to three spades, two hearts, one diamond and two clubs for down one and half a point.
Here is a third deal from the WorldWinner Bridge (www.worldwinner.com) online pair game in which I competed on Dec. 28. Sevens are supposed to be lucky, and two of them combined for a pretty ending in the diagramed deal, which was declared by my partner from Israel, Anda Enciu.
South had an automatic weak two-heart opening, and I had an equally automatic raise to game. It was unlikely that we had a slam, and making an inquiry bid of two no-trump would only help the defenders.
West must lead a trump to hold South to 11 tricks. That is not an impossible start, but there is a natural tendency to make an active, not a passive, opening lead. The club queen is feasible, but our opponent led his lowest spade.
My partner could have worked on diamonds, eventually establishing North's queen. But that works only because both red suits split favorably. Instead, after winning the first trick with the dummy's spade queen, she ducked a club, East taking the trick with his eight and shifting to a trump to stop two club ruffs on the board.
Declarer won in the dummy, played a club to her ace, ruffed a club, cashed the spade ace, trumped a spade and ran the hearts. With one round to go, this was the position:
Look at those symmetric sevens applying pressure to the opponents. When South cashed her last heart, West had to throw a diamond to stop dummy's spade seven from becoming a trick. That seven could now be discarded. Then it was East who felt the pinch. He had to keep his club king to cover declarer's seven, so he also gave up a diamond.
South played a diamond to dummy's ace, confident that the king would appear. Plus 480 gave us a 98 percent score.
Two pairs reached six hearts, one going down one after the club-jack lead and the other finishing down three after the spade-deuce lead.
"Feels like home," the trumpeter Ingrid Jensen observed at one point on Thursday night at the 55 Bar. She was referring not only to the setting, a frequent haunt since her arrival in New York more than 15 years ago, but also to the occasion: she was celebrating the release of "At Sea" (ArtistShare), an album inspired in part by her recent honeymoon in Alaska. Her husband, Jon Wikan, produced the album, and he was close at hand; he also happens to be her drummer. 
Intimacy isn't always a hallmark of Ms. Jensen's music. As a soloist, she favors rhythmic assertiveness and chromatic tension, a combination suggestive of post-bop trumpet heroes like Woody Shaw. "At Sea" gestures toward a gentler sensibility at times, beginning with the yearning and ethereal title track. 
Thursday's first set was sequenced like the album, and so it opened hazily, with a wash of cymbals and indeterminate chords. Ms. Jensen played the melody with a muted horn, deploying electronic echoes for good measure. Her solid band - Mr. Wikan with Geoffrey Keezer on Fender Rhodes keyboard, Matt Clohesy on bass and Lage Lund on guitar - briefly savored the abstraction before shifting into gear.
They hit full stride on the next tune, Mr. Keezer's bright Latin-bop entry "Capt'n Jon." (There's a theme at work here.) Ms. Jensen and Mr. Lund doubled the soaring melody over a bubbling bass ostinato; they both soloed, too, though Mr. Keezer's choruses were the more engagingly high-spirited. 
Ms. Jensen spent roughly half the set courting melancholy with her fluegelhorn, on which she has a warm and shadowy tone. But she sounded better when she was blazing. Her closing piece, "Swotterings," provided the perfect opportunity, progressing from a second-line groove to a breakneck modal swing. Ms. Jensen's solo came across as impetuous yet soundly structured, as she interspersed staccato eighth-note bursts with clarifying pauses. 
Those high-flying exertions felt every bit as personal as the set's more introspective moments, perhaps because they captured Ms. Jensen's voice. Digging in with her supportive group, she seemed not at sea, but at home. 
Donald J. Trump, the real estate investor, said yesterday that he had filed a lawsuit against Timothy L. O'Brien, who wrote "TrumpNation: The Art of Being the Donald," and the book's publisher, Warner Books, for making what Mr. Trump called "egregiously false and malicious statements." Mr. O'Brien is also a reporter for The New York Times.
At issue is Mr. Trump's net worth, which Mr. O'Brien reported was $150 million to $250 million, citing three people with direct knowledge of Mr. Trump's finances. Mr. Trump contends that his net worth is at least $2.7 billion.
"TrumpNation" was published in October 2005 and excerpted in the Sunday Business section of The New York Times. A spokeswoman for The Times, Catherine J. Mathis, declined to comment on the lawsuit. The Times is not a party to the lawsuit, which seeks $5 billion.
In a statement, a spokesman for Warner Books, Rob Nissen, said: "Mr. O'Brien is an award-winning, veteran business reporter with The New York Times and his work, as does his book, 'TrumpNation,' speak for themselves. Mr. O'Brien has not seen nor has he been served with the court papers to which Mr. Trump is referring. But Mr. O'Brien welcomes the opportunity to meet with Mr. Trump personally at any time and in any forum to discuss the merits of 'TrumpNation,' a book in which Mr. Trump participated extensively and willingly."
The brain drain started after World War II. Top professionals in their fields moved to the United States, where the rewards were greatest and the standard of living the best. No government official contemplated bridge players joining this migration, but many foreign stars have made their home in the United States. To name but a few: Benito Garozzo, Boris Koytchou, Sam Lev, Peter Leventritt, Jacek Pszczola, Barry Rigal and Alan Truscott.
Michael Rosenberg of New Rochelle, N.Y., sort of fits on that list because he learned bridge in Scotland. But he was born in the United States, moved to Scotland with his family when he was 6 months old and returned in 1978, shortly before his 24th birthday. He is one of the very best players, in particular proving his card-play skill by winning the World Par Contest in 1998.
He was the declarer on the diagramed deal, which occurred during the Sunday Flight A/X Swiss Teams on Jan. 15 in the Hilton Rye Town hotel. It was submitted by East, Jerry Goldberg of Yonkers. He commented that they were doing poorly and were surprised to discover that in the last round they were drawn against the strong team including Rosenberg.
North was Bruce Rogoff of Upper Grandview, N.Y. His three-spade response was Minor-Suit Stayman. And since three no-trump denied interest in the minors, North's four-no-trump quantitative raise was aggressive. With three fitting minor-suit honors, South jumped to six no-trump.
At the other table, South made three no-trump with two overtricks, so a lot of points were riding on the result of this poor slam.
West, Jane Dillenberg of New York City, led the heart jack. Declarer won with the dummy's heart ace and took a spade finesse. When it held, he analyzed the situation at length. Clearly, if diamonds were 3-3, the contract would almost certainly make. But in case the diamond split was bad, Rosenberg wondered about an extra chance via a squeeze or an endplay. Finally he decided that finding an opponent with the doubleton club jack was the only realistic hope. At Trick 3 South led the club queen from his hand.
West chose to duck this, so declarer cashed the club ace and played a third club. A moment later Rosenberg claimed, taking three tricks in each suit and gaining 13 international match points.
Afterward Rosenberg made some interesting points. If West had taken the club queen with her king and returned the heart ten, declarer would have had the option of trying the diamonds (discarding a heart from his hand), then running the club ten. This works when East has K-10-x of spades and the club jack. Alternatively, declarer could have cashed the third high heart (discarding a club from the dummy), then tried the diamonds. When they do not divide 3-3, South would lead dummy's club ten. If East started with the spade king, club jack and 5-2-4-2 or 4-3-4-2 distribution, he would be squeezed between spades and diamonds on the third club to dummy's nine. Similarly, if East were 4-2-4-3 with the club jack, he would have been squeezed by the third heart. But, Rosenberg concluded, it is probably best simply to win the second heart in his hand and to cash the club ace, playing for the jack to drop.
Rosenberg also believes that whenever declarer has a "good" play available, a defender may be able to counter with his own "good" play. He pointed out that West would have found a brilliant duck at Trick 3 if she had begun with K-J-x-x of clubs and three diamonds.
Although Rosenberg's team failed to place in this event, he won the most master points during the District 3 Tri-State Regional, with 82.69, ahead of Richard DeMartino of Riverside, Conn., with 56.08, and William Ehlers of West Orange, N.J., with 55.77.

FOOL millions, make millions. Fool Oprah, lord help you.
James Frey, the author of "A Million Little Pieces" -- which could yet become the first book ever to lead both the fiction and nonfiction best-seller lists -- reported to the set of "Oprah" on Thursday to complete his public abasement. Ms. Winfrey turned on him with calculated efficiency, using him to mop up the floor and clean up her reputation at the same time.
She did not stop there, going on to lecture Nan A. Talese, the head of Doubleday, about the need for the book industry to be more careful in choosing what to stand behind -- good advice, from someone who should know. Her show was a tutorial in how to take responsibility and deflect it to others at the same time; by the end, the truth and Ms. Winfrey were aggrieved in equal measure.
But the battle cry to reform the book industry was really just an effort to repair the specific damage to Ms. Winfrey's own lustrous brand. Last year, Ms. Winfrey had put some Oprah's Book Club lightning on "A Million Little Pieces" and it ended up selling 3.5 million copies. Even after the Smoking Gun (www.thesmokinggun.com) blew giant holes in Mr. Frey's version of his life, Mr. Winfrey continued to defend him -- calling in during "Larry King Live" in his defense -- until it was clear that it was not just his reputation that was taking a pounding.
How was it that "A Million Little Pieces" came to pose an asymmetric threat to both the book industry and Ms. Winfrey? The book never seemed to be a big issue among people I talked to who were recovering from addictions -- most of them thought he was full of beans. But for a broader aspirational audience, his triumph over addiction was both unbelievable and totally believable.
And no one knows the cycle of triumph, abasement and rehabilitation better than Ms. Winfrey, who embodies bootstrap excellence. Perhaps that may be part of the reason she fell so hard for James Frey, who threw off his chains without, as Newsweek pointed out, any of those "wussy 12-step programs."
ALTHOUGH Mr. Frey, unlike Ms. Winfrey, was a child of privilege who had to walk a long way to find trouble and inflict it on himself, his book's underlying message about the strength of individual will and stubbornness -- he seemed to sober up out of spite more than anything else -- was too compelling to put down for Ms. Winfrey, who had been told that she was doing it the wrong way ever since she started to build her media empire.
But, in her own way, in her own time, she came to understand that she had been had by Mr. Frey. Thursday, she opened the show by looking directly into the camera and saying, "I made a mistake and I left the impression that the truth does not matter. And I am deeply sorry about that, because that is not is what I believe."
But what started as a mea culpa soon turned into j'accuse. Both Mr. Frey and Ms. Talese were snapped in two like dry winter twigs. A Greek chorus of media types (including from The New York Times), ostensibly on hand to provide third-party context to examine Ms. Winfrey's enthrallment with a con, mostly fell into step as well. Richard Cohen, the Washington Post columnist who had written that Ms. Winfrey was "deluded," was beaming and describing her as "mensch of the year."
By the time the program was over, she was surrounded by carnage, but she did not have a hair out of place. "I believe the truth matters," she concluded to thunderous applause.
And so it does. With network news crippled and major newspapers suspect, Ms. Winfrey is regarded as a bulwark of veracity. But as this episode proves, she can be had when a narrative bends to her belief system or touches on her sense of moral outrage.
Just last September, she visited New Orleans after the flood and spoke with Mayor C. Ray Nagin and Chief Edwin P. Compass III about life inside the Superdome. "We had little babies in there, some of the little babies getting raped," the mayor said. "They have people standing out there, have been in that frickin' Superdome for five days watching dead bodies, watching hooligans killing people, raping people."
Not much of that was true either, but there was no well-considered corrective, no royal summons for the mayor and police chief to come to Chicago and explain themselves. In that case, the damage done was to the reputation of a flooded city, not the Brand Called Oprah.
How strong is that brand? Consider that Ms. Winfrey is about to set new standards and principles for an industry that she does not belong to. "The book industry has been deeply embarrassed and I think that her show pointed up the disconnect between publishing and the real world," said Sara Nelson, editor in chief of Publishers Weekly.
If Mr. Frey is the pathogen, then Ms. Winfrey will be the catalyst. Look for a great deal of noise about fact-checking and the book industry's sacred trust with the reader.
"I think whether it is going to be a fig leaf or an honest attempt to make sure we are a bastion of accuracy, something is going to happen," said David Hirshey, executive editor of HarperCollins (a subsidiary of the News Corporation).
But Ms. Winfrey will not fix the book business any more than she fixed television when she dumped the tabloid elements of her show years ago. She is a cultural Dustbuster, someone who cleans up messes by living her values and focusing on what is good and right. Her willingness to put both her wealth and her mouth on the line has improved lives in South Africa, raised much-needed money for New Orleans and made any number of afflictions household names.
She is also a force for good because she reminds people staring at the television that there is a big wide world of words out there. Sales of "Night," Elie Wiesel's holocaust memoir, are already beginning to soar as her next book club selection, demonstrating that her taste and title-making abilities are undiminished.
But she won't repair the book business by a wag of the finger. The most important thing that Ms. Winfrey can do for publishing is pick better books.
David Carr Correction: February 1, 2006, Wednesday A David Carr column in Business Day on Monday, about Oprah Winfrey's response to inaccuracies in the book, "A Million Little Pieces" by James Frey, misstated the post held by Nan A. Talese, the book's publisher. She leads a division within Doubleday, she is not the head of it.
WASHINGTON, Feb. 14 - The Senate has never been a bastion of managerial efficiency. But as the campaign season gets into full swing, lawmakers say things are clearly getting worse.
Four cabinet secretaries, including Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, an Army general and the secretary of the Army were supposed to testify Tuesday morning at hearings on matters including Hurricane Katrina and the Bush administration's proposed budget for foreign affairs.
But their invitations were rescinded and the hearings canceled when the Senate majority leader, Bill Frist of Tennessee, scheduled a marathon series of 16 votes on amendments to a pending tax bill -- all of them, both parties agree, intended more to score political points than to make policy.
Ultimately, most of those votes were canceled.
They could have been held Monday night, but that did not work for Mr. Frist. He was holding a fund-raiser at his Washington home, with President Bush as the featured guest and some of his Republican colleagues on the guest list, including the Senate whip, Mitch McConnell of Kentucky. The event raised $3.5 million for Republican Senate candidates.
So Mr. Frist put the votes off until Tuesday. Half of them were to be on amendments offered by Democrats.
As Jim Manley, a spokesman for the Democratic leader, Senator Harry Reid of Nevada, explained, "They were designed to show that Republicans were favoring tax cuts for the wealthy instead of tax breaks for the middle class."
Republicans had responded with what Senator Trent Lott of Mississippi, the former Republican leader, called eight of "our own blatantly political amendments."
By Tuesday morning cooler heads prevailed, and the number of votes was pared back to three. By that time, though, all of the scheduled hearings had been canceled, leaving a lot of miffed and sheepish senators.
"I look around," Mr. Lott said, "and think, 'Am I the only one who thinks this is stupid?' "
Senator Ted Stevens, Republican of Alaska, said, "It's sort of arrogant of us, isn't it, scheduling them and then not keeping our appointments?"
Stupid, perhaps. Arrogant, maybe. But not entirely out of character for the Senate, where roll-call votes are frequently held late into the night and schedules can change at a moment's notice. Still, some said the organizational chaos was worse than usual, and this being Washington in an election year, many fingers were being pointed.
Mr. Lott, who prided himself on keeping the trains on time when he was majority leader and who might try to return to a leadership spot if he is re-elected in November, said both sides were at fault.
"The Senate continues to fiddle while Rome burns," he said in a long speech on Monday afternoon on the Senate floor. He complained that the Senate had previously voted on similar Democratic amendments and urged Republican leaders to "get a grip on this situation."
Some Democrats, meanwhile, suggested that Republicans had let their fund-raising efforts pre-empt Senate business.
"When you have a Senate that is dictated by airline schedules and fund-raising events, we don't have as many days to work," said Senator Richard J. Durbin, Democrat of Illinois. "That's why I'm supporting public financing" for campaigns, he added.
Mr. Frist's chief of staff, Eric Ueland, shot back that the Democrats were the ones practicing the politics of delay.
"It is not Bill Frist who is slowing down the process for obstruction's sake," Mr. Ueland said. "It is Harry Reid who is responsible for this inanity."
But Mr. Reid, a former boxer, defended himself, saying his eight amendments were a show of restraint. "We could have filed 80 or 800," he said.
In the end, most of the hearing appearances were rescheduled. The Army secretary, Francis J. Harvey, and the general, Peter J. Schoomaker, who is the Army chief of staff, testified on Tuesday afternoon.
Secretary Rice and Michael Chertoff, the homeland security secretary, are expected to appear Wednesday morning. Jim Nicholson, the secretary of veterans affairs, is scheduled to testify Thursday. But an appearance by John W. Snow, the treasury secretary, had not been rescheduled.
Mr. Snow was making his second effort to fulfill a Senate obligation; he was initially to appear last week, but the session was canceled because it conflicted with the funeral for Coretta Scott King.
Mr. Snow's spokesman, Tony Fratto, said the secretary did not mind being invited, uninvited, reinvited and uninvited again. "We try to be understanding about it," Mr. Fratto said. "There aren't any hard feelings."
Still, the changes created confusion. Mr. Reid was asked if a business could be run like the Senate is. "Yeah," he replied, "but not very well."
Arguably the most enjoyable one-day event on the calendar of the Greater New York Bridge Association is the Betty Kaplan Teams. This was contested last Saturday at the New York Helmsley Hotel in Midtown Manhattan. Every team consisted of four players. There were six nine-board matches, and each participant had to play two of these matches with each of her or his teammates.
The teams of Sandrea Friedman, Michael Rosen, David Rosenberg and Philip Silverstein of New York; and Mark Dean of Jersey City and Kevin Casey, David Moss and Daniel Wilderman of New York tied for first place.
In the diagramed deal Casey earned his team a slam swing despite the 5-0 trump break. North's two-club response was natural and game-forcing. After South bid diamonds twice, describing his 5-5 distribution, North used Roman Key Card Blackwood. South showed two key cards (one ace and the trump king or, as here, two aces) but denied the diamond queen. North, Wilderman, settled his partner into six diamonds.
West started with the heart eight. Since this was declarer's first-bid suit, the lead was highly likely to be a singleton. Declarer won the first trick with his heart queen, ruffed a heart on the board (West threw a spade) and ran the diamond queen to West's king. West shifted to the spade jack. South won with the dummy's ace, cashed the diamond ten, played a spade to his king, drew trumps and claimed 12 tricks: two spades, two hearts, one heart ruff, four diamonds, and three clubs.
At the other table, the contract was three no-trump, made with two overtricks. So the Casey team gained 12 international match points.

TURIN, Italy - IF Bode Miller is the bane of the United States Olympic team for not taking the privilege of competing here seriously, how can Shani Davis be the selfish one for making one race his all-consuming priority?
If Lindsey Jacobellis symbolizes Generation X Games, the dudes and dudettes more interested in styling than winning, how could Davis be criticized for never losing focus on what he has wanted to win for all of his skating life?
If Chad Hedrick had the opportunity to crash a significant social barrier, would he have taken a circuitous path to the finish line or made a mad dash for the history book?
A rhetorical question, that last one, because Hedrick is not Davis and couldn't possibly imagine what it was like to be inside his skates last night, when Davis became the first black athlete to claim an individual gold medal at the Winter Olympics by winning the men's speedskating 1,000 meters.
"Shani skated fast today, that's about all I have to say," Hedrick said after finishing sixth and continuing to wrap himself in a red, white and blue team concept that doesn't really exist.
Davis has been a solitary figure in this all-white sport from the day he started, and ugly e-mail reminders of that get sent to his Web site all the time, he said last night. And Hedrick thinks he's the victim?
Forget the five gold medals Hedrick supposedly had a chance for here at the 2006 Winter Games. He said last night that "you never heard a quote from me" about it, and that he never expected to win the 1,000, a distance he rarely competes in and one dominated all season by Davis.
Hedrick was the leader on the board for much of the race, until Davis bettered him by almost a second in his winning time of 1 minute 8.89 seconds.
"You skate eight laps, three times," Hedrick said of Thursday's team pursuit, the relay Davis skipped to concentrate on the 1,000, making him, in Hedrick's mind, a disloyal teammate, a lousy patriot. "Do you think it's going to help or hurt you?"
Good point, only Davis made it better after rising to the challenge he had magnified, the pressure he had intensified, by passing on the relay the Americans failed to win a medal in without him.
"If the shoe was on the other foot, would he have skated the team pursuit?" Davis said of Hedrick. "We'll never know, but people do what's best for them."
A gold medalist, Davis is also an astute judge of human nature. It's the Olympics, not the Final Four. At the highest levels, these athletes are hoping for a career-affirming achievement, personal validation of more practice hours than they can remember.
Cherie Davis, the maternal muscle behind the man, didn't put her Shani on skates at the age of 6, in a sport posting prohibitive odds for a black kid from Chicago, so he could dream of sharing a medal. Four years ago in Salt Lake City, Davis was a 19-year-old short-track skater who was left off the relay team, who marched in the opening ceremony and went home. Based on that experience, he said he was loath to bump another skater, an explanation, credible or not, that he didn't owe anyone.
"I don't know what the pursuit would have done to him," said Casey FitzRandolph, the American who finished ninth last night. "But it's hard to argue with his decision not to do it. For the most part, this is an individual sport."
If Davis's presence in the team pursuit would have secured gold -- a questionable assumption in any Winter Olympics event -- wouldn't that have been the safe play, the sure medal for his mantle? Davis apparently expected more of himself, and good for him.
Hedrick already had a gold medal after winning the 5,000 meters on the first day of the Games. He is a contender in the 1,500- and 10,000-meter races to come. For Davis, who had won his last six 1,000-meter races, setting a world record along the way, last night was the Super Bowl, his Wimbledon final.
In other settings, we salute premier athletes who approach their work with single-minded purpose. Derek Jeter comes to mind. Tiger Woods. Hideki Matsui says he wants to win a World Series so much that he won't play for Japan in the World Baseball Classic.
Only an opponent with an ax to grind, a grudge to hold, could fail to understand that Davis might never get a gold-medal opportunity this good. "There's always people coming," he said after sweating out heats that produced the silver medalist, the American Joey Cheek, and the bronze winner, Erben Wennemars of the Netherlands.
In a candid, freewheeling news conference that should have disarmed remaining critics, Davis likened himself to a child waiting at a vending machine for a candy bar to drop as Cheek and others pushed Hedrick off the board. Davis circled the oval, inside the track. Hearty, knowledgeable Dutch fans cheered Davis, a popular skater in the Netherlands and the subject of a documentary there.
One scene captured Cherie Davis addressing her son after he failed to make the Olympic short-track team this winter, saying, "Someone's going to see what a loser you are." Not last night, and maybe never again. Davis won the race that always suited him best, the one he predicted he would win when he was just a kid talking, playing, dreaming.
He made it come true. He deserves credit, admiration, not scorn.

Donald Trump and Martha Stewart have rekindled their battle. The two pop-culture icons have been in a back and forth tempest over the television reality show "The Apprentice." In a biting letter, Trump wrote that Stewart's version of "The Apprentice" was "a mistake for everybody - especially NBC." The real-estate mogul was responding to Stewart's comments in Newsweek that "Martha Stewart: The Apprentice" floundered in autumn - canceled after one cycle - because Trump would not take his competing show off the schedule. Her show was supposed to be the only "Apprentice" and was meant to start out with her firing Trump on the air, she said. Trump's response asks Stewart to take responsibility for her "failed show." "Essentially, you made this firing up, just as you made up your sell order of ImClone," said Trump, who claimed NBC did not intend to fire him on Stewart's show. In a statement, Stewart, who lost an appeal last month that ended her criminal case for lying about a stock sale that sent her to jail, said she was bewildered by Trump's comments and tone.Trump fired back on CNBC, saying repeatedly that he was upset because he was "her number one advocate," adding, "and what does she do? She blames me for her show's failure." (AP)
E.L. Doctorow has beennamed the winner of the PEN/ Faulkner Award for fiction. The winning work was "The March," his best-selling novel about General William Tecumseh Sherman's devastating march through the Confederate South. Each of the four runners- up will receive $5,000. They are Karen Fisher for "A Sudden Country," William Henry Lewis for "I Got Somebody in Staunton," James Salter for "Last Night" and Bruce Wagner for "The Chrysanthemum Palace." (NYT)
The two iconic shirts from the final scene of "Brokeback Mountain," which was nominated for eight Academy Awards, sold for a staggering $101,100.51 to a Hollywood collector after an auction on eBay. In the Ang Lee film and the Annie Proulx short story on which it is based, the shirts symbolize the thwarted love of the ranch hands Jake and Ennis. They were dirty from sweat and blood and tucked one inside the other. The Los Angeles collector Tom Gregory won the bidding, which quickly reached the tens of thousands of dollars from an initial price of $9.99. "It's a great prop; it's the ruby slippers of our time," Gregory said in an interview. The proceeds from the auction will benefit a children's charity auction. (NYT)

Lindsay Lohan says she wants to be considered a serious actress. She told Allure in its March issue, "I hate it when people call me a teen queen." The actress, star of family- friendly movies like "Freaky Friday" and "Herbie: Fully Loaded," has recently graduated to more grown-up roles, acting opposite Meryl Streep, Lily Tomlin and Tommy Lee Jones in Robert Altman's "A Prairie Home Companion," due in U.S. theaters in June.

Miles Davis is considerably more than a touchstone for the trumpeter Wallace Roney. Through most of the 1980's, the endorsement and close guidance of Davis reinforced Mr. Roney's reputation as one of the blazing talents of a new generation. And in 1991, the legend brought his protégé onstage as backup at the Montreux Jazz Festival, passing the torch in an almost literal sense. It's a chicken-and-egg question as to how the relationship affected Mr. Roney's trumpet style, but there's no mistaking the basic connection: in terms of color, timbre, articulation and vocabulary, what you hear points unmistakably to Miles.
Mr. Roney, now 45, has inveighed against lingering comparisons to his mentor, but he has also kept stirring the embers of his emulation. At the Village Vanguard on Tuesday, he took to the stage in a gold-embroidered jacket and wraparound shades -- sartorial choices suggestive of Davis at the dawn of the 70's -- and led his ensemble in a matching style. His wife, Geri Allen, conjured a Herbie Hancock sound on acoustic and electric pianos; his brother, Antoine Roney, more flagrantly adopted the early-fusion tenor and soprano saxophone scrawl of Wayne Shorter. The drummer, Eric Allen, thrashed intensely in a Tony Williams vein, and the bassist, Charnett Moffett, evoked Ron Carter.
The ensemble's sound suggested the moment of transition between Davis's exalted 1960's quintet (Hancock-Shorter-Williams-Carter) and his more porous fusion bands; it was as if the 1968 Columbia/Legacy album "Filles de Kilimanjaro" had produced a direct line of descent instead of signaling the end of an era. The presence of a D.J., Val Jeanty, added only a dash of contemporary flavor: after interspersing a spoken-word sample in the opening number, Ms. Jeanty functioned strictly as an auxiliary percussionist whose instrument happened to be the turntable.
Yet that spoken-word sample was instructive: "I am mesmerized by the essence of all this beauty," purred a female voice in an appropriately rapturous tone, adding knowingly, "There is a black messiah coming." The band backed both sentiments with full commitment, maintaining a sinuous, insistent groove.
The cohesion of Mr. Roney's band was a double-edged sword; its fervent collective focus often swallowed individual improvisations. Ms. Allen provided the abiding exception, along with the set's best solos. It was during her texture-minded excursions -- sometimes with one hand on the club's Steinway and the other on her Fender Rhodes -- that the rhythm section opened up and breathed.
Mr. Roney, whose playing exhibited the pinched trills, chromatic tension and fluid aggression of you-know-who, led the group with forceful authority, steering the music toward the sound he had in mind. At times he hit upon it exactly, and responded with the most distinctively un-Milesian gesture of the evening: a big, beaming smile.
The Wallace Roney Sextet continues through Sunday (March 12) at the Village Vanguard, 178 Seventh Avenue South, at 11th Street, West Village, (212) 255-4037.
Antidepressants work better than psychotherapy in preventing relapses in elderly men and women who have recovered from depression, a new study suggests.
The government-financed study, published today in The New England Journal of Medicine, found that a combination of drugs and therapy was the best way to restore well-being in seriously depressed patients 70 and older. Once the patients had recovered, however, drug treatment was more effective over the next two years than once-a-month psychotherapy.
Experts said the results underscored the challenges of treating depression in people past retirement age who are buffeted by anxieties -- about dying, losing friends, declining physical health -- that are different from those of younger adult patients.
The report also suggests that an orchestrated combination of psychotherapy, medication and careful case management followed by continued drug treatment can keep more than 40 percent of elderly people well for at least two years.
Past studies have found that antidepressants alone are no better than placebos in relieving depression in people over 70, who tend to be more vulnerable to the drugs' side effects, including dizziness. But most of the estimated six million elderly Americans who suffer from depression receive little more than a prescription for an antidepressant if they receive treatment at all, psychiatrists say.
"What this study shows is how well we can do when people get the state-of-the-art treatment, from some of the best people in the field, but it's very rarely done this way," said Dr. Gary Kennedy, chief of geriatric psychiatry at the Montefiore Medical Center in the Bronx.
Dr. Charles Reynolds, a psychiatry professor at the University of Pittsburgh, led the study of 195 people 70 and older in a program that included daily doses of the antidepressant Paxil and 12 to 15 weekly, hourlong therapy sessions. The therapy taught people how to manage relations with family members and friends, a common source of distress. The patients continued to see a nurse, social worker or psychologist at least once a month during the study.
After 16 weeks, 116 of the participants had improved significantly. The researchers continued to treat about half of them with medication and case management, and the other half with a placebo. Two years later, 37 percent of those who had continued on medication but did not receive psychotherapy had a recurrence, while 68 percent of those who had only psychotherapy relapsed. When drugs were combined with therapy, 35 percent had a recurrence -- a result not significantly different from that achieved by medication alone.
Dr. Reynolds and members of his team have received research support from GlaxoSmithKline, the maker of Paxil.
"This is an illness that keeps coming back again and again, and with each succeeding episode it gets tougher to treat," said Dr. Reynolds. "What this study shows, and what I tell patients, is we have a good insurance policy.
"You may make a good recovery and want to stop medication and hope the depression doesn't come back, and that's fine. But you have another option."

Donald Trump has a new apprentice. Trump's wife, Melania Knauss Trump, gave birth to a boy, the billionaire developer announced. "Everyone's perfect," Trump said in a telephone interview on MSNBC's "Imus in the Morning," about 20 minutes after the arrival of his fifth child. The boy has been named Barron William Trump, said Knauss Trump's spokeswoman."I continue to stay young, right? I produce children, I stay young," said Trump, 59. The baby is Trump's fifth child and the first for his wife, who is 35. The tycoon's first wife, Ivana Trump, is the mother of Donald Jr., Ivanka and Eric, who are all in their 20s. Tiffany, 12, is the daughter of Trump's second wife, Marla Maples. (AP)
British detectives have begun to investigate reports that members of the police have been selling close-up pictures of naked people who took part in a huge group photograph taken last year by an American artist, Reuters reported. About 1,700 volunteers stripped last July in Newcastle, in northeastern England, for Spencer Tunick, who has staged mass nude shoots since 1992 in New York, London, Jerusalem, Vienna and elsewhere. (On Sunday, he gathered more than 1,500 naked Venezuelans in front of a statue of Simón Bolívar in Caracas, The Associated Press reported.) The police said pictures taken of the shoot by closed circuit television cameras were now being offered for sale in the area. "We've spoken to a number of officers and police staff and as a result two (civilian) members of police staff have been suspended," the Northumbria Police said in a statement.(NYT)
Al Pacino will star as King Herod in a Los Angeles stage production of Oscar Wilde's "Salomé." The one-act biblical drama is scheduled to run from April 14 to May 14 at the Wadsworth Theatre. Pacino will play the king who lusts after his wife's daughter, Salomé, played by Jessica Chastaine. Kevin Anderson plays John the Baptist, Salomé's object of affection and later revenge. Pacino, 65, worked with the director Estelle Parsons for two years developing the 2003 Broadway version of the play. Parsons will also direct the Los Angeles production. Tickets go on sale March 26.

Pamela Anderson has bought a condo at a $1 billion luxury high-rise under construction just west of the Las Vegas Strip, its developer said. The former "Baywatch" star purchased a 2-bedroom penthouse unit with more than 2,000 square feet, or 185 square meters, and views of the Strip facing north, south and east, said Laurence Hallier, chairman of Hallier Properties, which is developing Panorama Towers. Similar units sell for more than $2 million, he said. The actors Tobey Maguire and Leonardo DiCaprio also are reported to have bought into the development, the first tower of which is expected to be complete by midsummer. Anderson, who visits Las Vegas about six to eight times a year, bought a unit in Tower 4, which won't be ready until late 2008, Hallier said.(AP)
A federal judge has ordered a halt of sales of the debut album of the rap star Notorious B.I.G., who died in 1997. A jury determined that the title song of the album, "Ready to Die" (1994), included an unauthorized snippet of an Ohio Players tune. The move by the U.S. District Court in Nashville would freeze sales of one of rap's seminal albums - it has sold about 3.3 million copies since its release - though it was not clear when the ban would take effect. The decision came as a jury awarded $4.2 million in damages to the two companies that control the Ohio Players' recordings, Bridgeport Music and Westbound Records. The jury found that the Notorious B.I.G.'s label, Bad Boy Entertainment, improperly used a portion of the song "Singing in the Morning." Bridgeport and Westbound have filed hundreds of lawsuits to collect royalties over unauthorized samples.(NYT)
An exhibition of drawings by Michelangelo has broken the British Museum's record for advance sales, with more than 10,000 tickets sold, the BBC reported. "Michelangelo Drawings: Closer to the Master," which opens on Thursday and has 90 drawings from the Ashmolean Museum in Oxford, the Teylers Museum in the Netherlands and the British Museum's own collection, includes black-and-white chalk studies for "The Last Judgment" on the altar wall of the Sistine Chapel, and images of the Crucifixion, along with drawings Michelangelo used for teaching students.(NYT)

All no-trump contracts are basically the same. When declarer first gets on play, he immediately attacks the suit(s) from which he must establish the tricks he needs for his contract. In my library, I have only two tomes devoted to no-trump, but I have numerous books on suit play. The introduction of a trump suit produces a great upsurge in complexity and possibility.
The simple question of when to draw trumps is a conundrum. Should it be done immediately, or after a few tricks, or never? Yes! Each deal must be taken on its own merits. But when you have lots of trumps, especially with the top honors, you will normally draw trumps sooner rather than later. And if you have only, say, eight trumps and they are splitting badly -- 4-1 or 5-0 -- often you will do better not to touch the suit.
When a defender has the trump ace, he usually exercises some control over the course that the play will take. If a defender has a trump that has become a winner, when he plays that card may be vital. Even timing the use of a losing trump can prove critical -- as in the diagramed deal, which arose during a duplicate at Honors Bridge Club in Manhattan.
Against four hearts, West led his singleton spade, declarer winning with his ace. After drawing one round of trumps, playing a club to the board's king and taking the club ace (on which declarer discarded his spade loser), South could have got home in several ways, each involving an endplay on East. But it looked normal to duck a diamond to West, which declarer did, his nine losing to West's ten. That produced this end position:
If West leads a club, declarer ruffs, cashes the heart ace and plays the diamond ace. East may ruff at this trick or overruff the dummy on the next trick, but when he leads the spade king, South discards a diamond. East must continue with a spade to dummy's queen, and declarer has 10 tricks: two spades, five hearts, one diamond and two clubs.
West defended correctly, returning a trump. But when South led the diamond ace, East ruffed, grasping his opportunity to score an "impossible" trump trick. East played the club queen, but declarer discarded a diamond. Now came the spade king. South trumped, ruffed a diamond on the board and threw another diamond on the spade queen to make his contract.
East should have counted South's hand. Declarer was known to have started with 2-5-5-1 distribution, and when his diamond nine lost to West's ten, it should have been clear to East that South's diamonds were not strong. If East discards a spade on the diamond ace, declarer is doomed. If South draws East's trump, West collects three more diamond tricks. And if declarer ruffs a diamond, East overruffs and has two winners to lead: the spade king and the club queen. Whatever South does, he loses four tricks.
If a capable declarer unnecessarily gives you a chance to win an "impossible" trump trick, be extremely suspicious. Ruffing is probably what declarer -- a card-carrying member of the Greek gifts club -- wishes you to do.
Jazz keeps slowly widening, and the young trumpeters Shane Endsley and Jonathan Finlayson are working calmly and effectively at the perimeter. For a double bill at Tonic on Monday night, each brought his own band. Mr. Endsley's, too new to have a name, offered carefully plotted hummingbird music, full of evidence of a keen understanding of pop as well as of jazz, full of textures and stacked rhythms. Mr. Finlayson's, a brass-heavy group called Common Thread, was more solemn, and, at isolated moments, more explosive.
Neither are the trumpeters hyper-expressive, nor do they have huge sounds. Mr. Finlayson played straight, streamlined phrases without much ornamentation, and Mr. Endsley did something similar, with a number of different mutes. They are both fascinated with composition, and they work in the service of their writing, as well as of their bands.
Mr. Endsley has become known over the last few years for his work with Kneebody, a bubbling jazz quintet that uses a lot of electronics. This was different -- an acoustic bass instead of electric, a piano instead of electric keyboards and less backbeats. But the drive to mash different sounds together and do it with coordination was still there. The band included the pianist Erik Deutsch, the vibraphonist Matt Moran, the bassist Matt Clohesy, the guitarist Mike Gamble, and the drummer John Hollenbeck. All those chordal instruments could layer powerful drone textures, but nothing was ever monolithic. The music kept changing.
Mr. Gamble altered his style of playing every few bars: finger-tapping, heavy chords, quiet rhythm-and-blues licks, deep-reverb amplifier sounds. Constant change is part of Mr. Hollenbeck's style, too. He put objects on his snare drum to alter the sound when he hit it, or produced a small thumb-piano to play in counterpoint with Mr. Deutsch, or gradually built up a different rhythm with each limb. He is orchestral within himself, and a major asset to this group, where many little designs fit into one big one.
In Mr. Finlayson's band, there was a brass front-line: he and Mr. Endsley on trumpet, and Tim Albright on trombone, in front of Mr. Clohesy on bass again and the drummer Tyshawn Sorey. The music sounded choralelike, or sometimes marchlike, and owed a little to Henry Threadgill, as odd or long meters jostled against familiar elements that sounded as if they came from either parades or churches.
In "Folk Song," the set opener, the horns carried a long melody in staggered sections, and stayed solemn and tight while Mr. Sorey, a powerfully imaginative drummer of fractured, funky rhythms, was required to play quietly.
But later, Mr. Sorey broke loose, putting on a conceptual sideshow. In the third song, after simultaneous trumpet solos, he bent forward over his snare drum, blowing on its surface; he then picked it up, turned it around, and held it in front of his face, making percussive sounds with the metal wires. Then he turned to his floor tom and wrestled it a little, scraping its legs on the floor. (He looked about to transform the instrument's purpose, as if he would next use it to take a photograph or water a plant.) He turned the tom over, so that its legs stuck up in the air, while still shaking and shoving it. He wasn't playing the drum in the usual sense; he wasn't hitting it with sticks. But his motions were part of his solo, and this required no explanation.
Stocks rose yesterday as anticipation of better-than-expected earnings from technology companies tempered concern about higher interest rates and rising prices for oil and other commodities.
The Dow Jones industrial average gained 7.68 points, or less than 0.1 percent, to 11,137.65. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose 1 point, also less than 0.1 percent, to 1,289.12. The Nasdaq composite index advanced 11.43 points, or 0.49 percent, to 2,326.11. And the Russell 2000 index of smaller-capitalization companies gained 3.34 points, or 0.45 percent, closing at 751.11.
On the New York Stock Exchange, 11 stocks declined for each 9 that rose. Some 1.24 billion shares changed hands, the slowest trading day this year, as some investors took off early for Passover and Easter.
Concern about higher interest rates and bond yields has pushed the S.& P. 500 down from an almost five-year high reached last week.
The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note rose to 5.04 percent by late in the day yesterday, from 4.98 percent on Wednesday. It was the first time the yield had exceeded 5 percent since June 2002. The price of the 10-year note, which moves in the opposite direction from the yield, fell 16/32, to 95 26/32.
"When interest rates go up," said Ned Riley, chief investment officer at Riley Asset Management, "the stock market usually goes nowhere or goes down because of more competition from higher yields in bonds."
And remarks by a Federal Reserve governor, Donald L. Kohn, fueled new concern that the Fed would continue raising rates to restrain growth. "A further spurt in energy and commodity prices," he said, could be passed through into core inflation to a greater extent" than has occurred recently.
Crude oil for May delivery increased 1 percent, to settle at $69.32 a barrel in New York, the highest since Sept. 1, on speculation that the impasse over Iran's nuclear program would escalate and threaten some supplies.
A gauge of real estate investment trusts fell 1.4 percent, the biggest decline among the S.& P. 500's 24 industry groups. A gauge of utilities lost 0.5 percent as the rise in bond yields made the group's dividend payouts less attractive.
Boston Properties, a real estate firm founded by Mortimer B. Zuckerman, slid for a sixth day, down $1.01, to $85.99. Higher interest rates also spurred concern about a slowdown in the property market.
An S.& P. gauge of 16 home builders slid for a sixth day, losing 0.9 percent amid the rising interest rates. Hovnanian Enterprises, a large New Jersey-based home builder, fell 94 cents, to $41.39.
Among technology companies, I.B.M. added $1.23, to $81.98, after an analyst at Lehman Brothers said it would meet or exceed his earnings estimates. The company is to report quarterly results on Tuesday.
The advance of I.B.M., a bellwether stock, helped push a gauge of technology shares up 0.4 percent. I.B.M. is among more than 20 technology companies expected to report next week. Intel, Google and Apple Computer will also release revenue and earnings figures.
Advanced Micro Devices, which makes chips for personal computers, fell $3.62, or more than 10 percent, to $31.80, the worst performance in the S.&. P. 500, after it rose $1.07 on Wednesday. A.M.D. said sales this quarter would be "flat to seasonally down" from the $1.33 billion in the quarter just reported. Analysts had expected revenue of $1.35 billion, according to a Thomson Financial survey.
Intel, the leading computer chip maker, gained 33 cents, to close at $19.45. Some analysts say Intel is using price cuts to regain market share lost to from Advanced Micro.
Applied Materials, the largest maker of semiconductor equipment, rose 69 cents, to $18.11. Purchase orders from Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing, the world's largest made-to-order chip supplier, are beginning to accelerate, according to Michael O'Brien of Bear, Stearns.
Heart device makers, including Boston Scientific, fell on the prospect of cuts in Medicare reimbursement for hospital procedures. Boston Scientific, the top maker of cardiac stents in the United States market, declined 61 cents, to $21.55. Medtronic, the biggest maker of electronic heart devices, lost $1.11, to $49.93.
SanDisk, the largest maker of flash memory cards for electronics, rose $2.43, to $61.90. Standard & Poor's said SanDisk would replace Chiron in the S.& P. 500 after the markets close next Wednesday.
Donald J. Trump is scheduled to announce the donation of 400 acres of pristine hills and woods to the state at a news conference scheduled for today. Gov. George E. Pataki is to join Mr. Trump at the site on Indian Hill Road, along the edge of the Taconic State Parkway on the border of Westchester and Putnam Counties, for the announcement. The state plans to turn the land into a public park. Mr. Trump intended to build an 18-hole championship golf course and country club on the property, which he bought for $2 million in the early 1990's, but scrapped the project in the face of intense opposition from surrounding communities. FERNANDA SANTOS (NYT)
Gov. George E. Pataki and Donald Trump yesterday announced the creation of the Donald J. Trump State Park in two areas along the Taconic State Parkway. Mr. Trump donated the 436 acres of woodland in Putnam and Westchester Counties to the state. State Parks Commissioner Bernadette Castro said the park would open after wildlife was inventoried and trails were cut.

NEW YORK — Donald Trump handpicks apprentices on his popular U.S. television series, but the true apprentices - the ones destined to lead the Trump Organization - have much closer ties to the boardroom.
They are Donald Trump Jr., 28, and Ivanka Trump, 24, and they are slowly carving out a role in their famous father's real estate business while fashioning their own identities.
In cramped offices on the 26th floor of Trump's Fifth Avenue headquarters, Ivanka and Donald Jr. have been learning the art of the deal from their father.
"They are very formidable, very smart," Trump said. "They will promulgate the brand throughout the world. I have no doubt about it."
The siblings are positioning themselves to run the company one day, hoping to build on their father's successes, avoid his failures and bolster the company's fortunes.
"That's the intention," Ivanka said. "Ultimately, it's a family business."
But it has not been the straightest of paths to the family business for Donald Jr. and Ivanka.
Donald Jr. graduated from the prestigious Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania but spent time as a ski bum in Colorado prior to joining his father about five years ago. His father wanted him to focus on his profession, not the slopes.
"He was not happy about it," Donald Jr. recalled.
Ivanka, too, decided to do something a little different after attending Wharton. She worked for the New Jersey Nets owner, Bruce Ratner, on a large retail development.
Ivanka, who studied real estate and finance, took the suggestion of Peter Linneman, a Wharton professor she respected, to go out and prove she could succeed on her own merits.
About a year ago, Ivanka left Ratner. Her father's towering condo-hotel in Chicago beckoned.
Today, she travels the country, inspecting property and sifting through business pitches.At night, she takes classes in construction management at New York University. Paperwork containing potential deals clutters her desk alongside a pamphlet: "A Pocket Guide to Trump: How to Get Rich."
Her title is vice president of development, but she plays it down.
"We're not so big on roles around here," she said. "It's pretty much my father and the rest of the company."
But do not typecast Ivanka Trump, a former model.
"Ivanka was one of the smarter, better students," Linneman said. "She worked hard, did her fair share and then some. She's well-grounded and very genuine. She was not a limelight grabber."
Apparently she and her brother have bought into their father's philosophy that they need to earn their keep.
"If he didn't think we were doing a good job, he would fire us without hesitation," Ivanka said.
Donald Jr. put it more bluntly: "In my father's own words, he would fire us like dogs."
Donald Jr. has been with the Trump Organization longer than his sister, starting in 2001. Two years later, he began renovating a building, eventually overseeing the project.
The condos are almost sold, and he is still with the company as Trump's executive vice president of development and acquisitions.
At the moment, Donald Jr. is running his father's biggest developments in Las Vegas and Chicago, projects worth about $2.2 billion, currently under construction.
His most important moment since taking a job with his father - other than his recent marriage - came when he formed Trump Mortgage LLC.
This was the first deal the son had brought to the company from start to finish. Getting his father to sign off was not easy.
"You had to have every answer worked out," Donald Jr. said. "The second you start stammering in front of him, he's got you."
Trump, who is not known for lavishing anyone with praise, singled out his son in front of hundreds of people at a news conference earlier this month.
People who have spent time with Trump say he trusts his children and their judgment.
Despite the pressures of being Trump progeny, Ivanka and Donald Jr. say there are advantages in having the same last name as the boss. When people negotiate with them, they know they are negotiating with a principal. They know the children have Trump's attention.
"They have my ear," Trump says. "I respect them."
They can also challenge their father forcefully at times. They respect him,but they're not intimidated by his outsized personality.
"There's an openness we can have with him," Ivanka said.
If their father makes a decision and the children disagree, they can step behind closed doors and make their case again. Sometimes Trump changes his mind; other times he does not.
But if Trump takes the advice and it is wrong, "you'll never hear the end of it," Donald Jr. says with a smile.
Soon, another Trump will join the family business. In the fall, Eric, 21, a senior at Georgetown University, will arrive in New York.
Donald Jr. says all three siblings have type A personalities, and all three are ambitious. And all three have the same mother, Ivana, from their father's first marriage. Trump has two other children - Tiffany and Barron William - from his other two marriages. Tiffany is12 years old and Barron William was born in March.
Like Ivanka, Donald Jr. was diplomatic when asked to say who would take the helm when the boss stepped down.
He played down a sibling rivalry as did Ivanka, who described her relationship with Donald Jr. as more camaraderie than competition.
That is probably true. But they are also Trumps.
"When we want something, we go for it," Donald Jr. said.

Correction Appended
ATLANTA, April 28 - The Mets and the Braves play each other 18 or 19 times a season, depending on the schedule, but that by no means provides automatic grounds for rivalry status. After all, when one team (Braves) dominates the other (Mets) every year, word starts to spread around the National League.
"After hearing it, it seemed like we haven't won a game here in 10 years," said Billy Wagner, a former Astro and Phillie.
"I read the papers every once in a while," said Paul Lo Duca, a former Dodger and Marlin. "I know what's going on."
This year's team -- with Wagner, Lo Duca and a whole bunch of other new folks -- is proving, however, that, at least through 22 games, it is well equipped to withstand the Braves' charge. The Mets are in first place for a reason, and they followed their blueprint for success to the letter Friday night.
Take outstanding starting pitching (Pedro Martínez), a dynamic relief effort (Duaner Sánchez and Wagner) and clutch hitting (David Wright's two home runs, a crucial caught-stealing courtesy of Lo Duca), and what emerged was a 5-2 victory at Turner Field.
The Braves, per custom, made the Mets earn it. They loaded the bases with two outs in the ninth, and it took Wagner's called strikeout of Todd Pratt to put many of the 45,389 fans who stuck around for the postgame fireworks in a foul mood. "That was 1-2-3 with a couple of extras," Wagner said.
No matter. Martínez is 5-0. The Mets are 15-7, and they equaled last season's victory total here. Their lead over the Braves (9-13) and the Phillies is six games and, for a change, the Mets are putting pressure on the teams chasing them in the National League East. They have won three consecutive games. The Braves have lost four in a row, the Phillies two, and the schedule calls for five more games against the Braves in the next nine days.
Fortunately for the Braves, they will probably miss Martínez when they play at Shea Stadium next weekend. He outdueled John Smoltz in their fifth matchup in 13 months. Each starting pitcher lasted seven innings, but despite striking out 10, Smoltz made more mistakes than Martínez did. Smoltz allowed runs in the first, fourth and fifth innings to fall behind, 3-0. Martínez allowed four hits, including a two-run homer by Chipper Jones, the Braves' official Mets tormentor, that cut the Mets' lead to 3-2.
Manager Willie Randolph would not feel comfortable holding a six-game lead over the Braves unless there were five games remaining.
"It's like the Yankees series," Randolph said before the game. "We play the Yankees -- of course we want to win those games. But is it the end of the world? Is it going to make a big difference in the scheme of things? If it's September or late August, yeah, it's a little different. Right now, what does it mean?"
Martínez, who pitched in many a Red Sox-Yankees grudge match, called the Mets-Braves games "the kind that fills up a schedule." But he also views them through the prism of an opposing pitcher, and he knows Smoltz well. They faced each other four times last season, and each time they tried to outdo each other. Last April 10 here, Smoltz had 15 strikeouts and Martínez threw a two-hitter. On Sept. 6, Smoltz allowed one run in seven innings in a Braves victory. On Sept. 16, Martínez pitched a 10-strikeout, complete-game shutout.
"I wish I could match up against you," Martínez told a reporter when asked if he enjoyed the challenge of facing Smoltz.
Martínez said afterward that he felt stiff and "out of whack," but he retired the first seven hitters as if he were pitching a side session. He struck out Édgar Rentería on a 79-mile-an-hour changeup. He struck out Adam LaRoche on a 90-mile-an-hour fastball. Even when Martínez made a bad pitch -- like the flat cutter he threw to Jones in the fourth -- he still got a strikeout.
But Jones has 35 home runs and 104 runs batted in in 155 games against the Mets, and he was due to strike. In the sixth, he tagged Martínez's 0-2 cutter over the center-field fence.
The Braves tried to rally against Martínez in the seventh with Jeff Francoeur on first with one out. He tried to steal second on a 1-1 pitch, but Lo Duca, who had thrown out only 2 of 19 potential base stealers entering Friday, made a perfect throw to shortstop José Reyes.
Francoeur jogged back to the dugout. Martínez pumped his fist on the mound, leaving a couple of new Mets -- Sánchez and Wagner -- to finish off the victory with a flourish.
Afterward, as Lo Duca tied his shoes discussing what he knew about the Mets' miseries here, someone showed him paint chipping on the sides of his locker.
"Must have been from the last time they were here," Lo Duca said with a chuckle.
The last time they were here. Not this time.
INSIDE PITCH
The Mets placed Brian Bannister on the 15-day disabled list, retroactive to Thursday, and recalled Víctor DÍaz from Class AAA Norfolk. Bannister, who strained his right hamstring while running the bases Wednesday in San Francisco, flew to New York on Friday morning to be evaluated further by team doctors.
BASEBALL Correction: May 1, 2006, Monday A sports article on Saturday about the Mets' 5-2 victory over the Atlanta Braves referred incorrectly in some copies to details about the game. For Atlanta, Chipper Jones hit a home run in the sixth inning, not the seventh, and Jeff Francoeur, not Pete Orr, was thrown out trying to steal second base in the seventh inning. Mets pitcher Pedro Martínez retired the first seven hitters he faced, not the first eight.

Willie Randolph called Joe Torre a few days ago, one New York manager reaching out to another. Randolph was trying to congratulate Torre on his 1,000th victory with the Yankees, but Torre admitted he had not called back.
"It's my fault," Torre said yesterday, "because he certainly made the call, and I owe him one."
Every time he has thought of calling Randolph, Torre said, the Mets have been playing. Torre has been busy at other times, and it is hard to blame him for that. The Yankees are not exactly in a crisis, but their injury report takes a lot longer to read these days.
The Yankees lost to the Texas Rangers yesterday, 6-2, and they hobbled into Shea Stadium for the first of three games with the Mets tonight. Two All-Star outfielders  Hideki Matsui and Gary Sheffield  are on the disabled list, and one of their replacements may be headed there, too.
Bubba Crosby, who is 5 for 15 since Matsui broke his wrist last Thursday, strained his right hamstring while diving for a single by Kevin Mench in the fifth yesterday.
Crosby smoked a ball to the right-field corner in his next at-bat, but he was too hurt to try for a double and left the game. If the Yankees put him on the disabled list, they will probably promote Kevin Thompson, who did not start for Class AAA Columbus at Richmond last night.
"It feels like an epidemic," Crosby said. "Sheff goes down, and four or five days later, Hideki goes down. It's just kind of like, 'What's going on with our outfield?' "
The most likely alignment at Shea tonight will have Bernie Williams in left, Johnny Damon in center and Melky Cabrera in right. All three players are limited.
Williams has one start in left field since 1992. Damon is playing with a cracked bone in his right foot. Cabrera made two impressive catches in right field yesterday, but his defense is so shaky that Torre said he would rather not use him in left anymore.
Torre started Damon at designated hitter yesterday because he had already decided he would need him in the field all weekend. Under National League rules, the lineups will not include a designated hitter.
"I've been in that trainer's room a minimum of an hour a day since spring training, and they're doing a good job taking care of everything that comes up ailing," Damon said. "They're going to continue to do that and I'm going to continue to take the field in good times and bad. I know they can count on me."
Damon was 1 for 5 yesterday, striking out three times. He was the last out of the game as Akinori Otsuka struck out the side in the ninth inning.
The game was scoreless through six, with the Yankees' Jaret Wright matching the Rangers' Vicente Padilla. Wright retired the first eight hitters of the game and allowed just four singles through six innings.
But the seventh was uncharted territory for Wright, who had not pitched that deep into a game since last September. After Mench's leadoff single, Brad Wilkerson lifted a sinker into the first row of seats in the right-field upper deck.
"I looked at it, and I don't think it was that bad a pitch," Wright said. "I thought he did a good job of hitting it. You're not going to throw every ball exactly where you want to."
Wright left after hitting the next batter with a pitch, and the inning devolved from there.
Scott Erickson walked his first hitter, and after a sacrifice bunt, Gary Matthews Jr. hit a grounder to second baseman Robinson Canó with the infield in.
Canó picked the ball off the grass but then bobbled it, and his throw home was high, bouncing off Kelly Stinnett's glove for an error. Two runs scored to make it 4-0, and Francisco Cordero worked out of jams in the seventh and eighth, preserving the Rangers' lead.
Torre liked what he saw from Wright, who walked none over six innings and had his fourth solid start in a row. Wright, who barely pitched in April because of off days, has a chance to solidify his spot in the rotation with Carl Pavano's comeback now in doubt.
"I try to just focus on what I have to do to get ready for my next start," Wright said. "But we're definitely going in the right direction. If I can stay healthy and pitch like that, I'll take it."
Wright missed almost four months last season with a shoulder injury, but he said he had no problems now. "As far as you know," he said, smiling.
Wright was joking, but around the Yankees these days, you never can tell. They look across town with envy at the Mets, a team with its lineup intact.
"They did a good job this year of getting some really big, key players," Jason Giambi said. "But the biggest thing is they've all stayed healthy."
Willie Randolph called Joe Torre a few days ago, one New York manager reaching out to another. Randolph was trying to congratulate Torre on his 1,000th victory with the Yankees, but Torre admitted he had not called back.
"It's my fault," Torre said yesterday, "because he certainly made the call, and I owe him one."
Every time he has thought of calling Randolph, Torre said, the Mets have been playing. Torre has been busy at other times, and it is hard to blame him for that. The Yankees are not exactly in a crisis, but their injury report takes a lot longer to read these days.
The Yankees lost to the Texas Rangers yesterday, 6-2, and they hobbled into Shea Stadium for the first of three games with the Mets tonight. Two All-Star outfielders -- Hideki Matsui and Gary Sheffield -- are on the disabled list, and one of their replacements may be headed there, too.
Bubba Crosby, who is 5 for 15 since Matsui broke his wrist last Thursday, strained his right hamstring while diving for a single by Kevin Mench in the fifth yesterday.
Crosby smoked a ball to the right-field corner in his next at-bat, but he was too hurt to try for a double and left the game. If the Yankees put him on the disabled list, they will probably promote Kevin Thompson, who did not start for Class AAA Columbus at Richmond last night.
"It feels like an epidemic," Crosby said. "Sheff goes down, and four or five days later, Hideki goes down. It's just kind of like, 'What's going on with our outfield?' "
The most likely alignment at Shea tonight will have Bernie Williams in left, Johnny Damon in center and Melky Cabrera in right. All three players are limited.
Williams has one start in left field since 1992. Damon is playing with a cracked bone in his right foot. Cabrera made two impressive catches in right field yesterday, but his defense is so shaky that Torre said he would rather not use him in left anymore.
Torre started Damon at designated hitter yesterday because he had already decided he would need him in the field all weekend. Under National League rules, the lineups will not include a designated hitter.
"I've been in that trainer's room a minimum of an hour a day since spring training, and they're doing a good job taking care of everything that comes up ailing," Damon said. "They're going to continue to do that and I'm going to continue to take the field in good times and bad. I know they can count on me."
Damon was 1 for 5 yesterday, striking out three times. He was the last out of the game as Akinori Otsuka struck out the side in the ninth inning.
The game was scoreless through six, with the Yankees' Jaret Wright matching the Rangers' Vicente Padilla. Wright retired the first eight hitters of the game and allowed just four singles through six innings.
But the seventh was uncharted territory for Wright, who had not pitched that deep into a game since last September. After Mench's leadoff single, Brad Wilkerson lifted a sinker into the first row of seats in the right-field upper deck.
"I looked at it, and I don't think it was that bad a pitch," Wright said. "I thought he did a good job of hitting it. You're not going to throw every ball exactly where you want to."
Wright left after hitting the next batter with a pitch, and the inning devolved from there.
Scott Erickson walked his first hitter, and after a sacrifice bunt, Gary Matthews Jr. hit a grounder to second baseman Robinson Canó with the infield in.
Canó picked the ball off the grass but then bobbled it, and his throw home was high, bouncing off Kelly Stinnett's glove for an error. Two runs scored to make it 4-0, and Francisco Cordero worked out of jams in the seventh and eighth, preserving the Rangers' lead.
Torre liked what he saw from Wright, who walked none over six innings and had his fourth solid start in a row. Wright, who barely pitched in April because of off days, has a chance to solidify his spot in the rotation with Carl Pavano's comeback now in doubt.

IN the mid-1900's, Eugene I. Meyer Jr., financier, federal government official and later the owner of The Washington Post, entertained in grand style at his Georgian-style mansion overlooking Byram Lake in northern Westchester.
The stately home, where Katharine Graham, Meyer's daughter, the longtime publisher of The Post, was raised, was renowned for its orangery -- a separate glass and stone building where the family grew citrus fruit in the winter and held parties -- and a bowling alley in the basement.
Now, Donald J. Trump, the latest owner of the 213-acre Seven Springs estate, which sits on a high point reaching into the towns of Bedford, North Castle and New Castle, plans to use the glass and stone conservatory and the 39,000-square-foot mansion for himself and his family.
Meyer commissioned Charles Platt, an artist turned architect and prominent landscape gardener, to design the estate, and it was built in 1919 from native sandstone quarried on the property. The mansion features an indoor pool encased in white marble on the first floor, with 13 bedrooms, 12 baths and a playroom on the second and third floors.
"That will be my home with Melania and Barron," Mr. Trump said last week, referring to his wife and newborn son.
The mansion was built for $2 million in 1919 and sold to Mr. Trump for $7.5 million in 1995. Since then, Mr. Trump noted, "the housing market's gone through the roof."
Frustrated in his original plans for a golf course at Seven Springs -- which faced opposition in all three municipalities -- and now saying that he has decided against competing with his own Trump National Golf Club in Briarcliff Manor, Mr. Trump plans to build 15 luxury estate homes on the property and renovate two of the historic residences there, including the Meyer mansion.
Some residents of Mount Kisco opposed the golf club because they were worried that chemical runoff from the course would imperil the Byram Lake reservoir, a source of their drinking water.
After undergoing arduous environmental reviews but before any decisions had been handed down, the developer also jettisoned plans for two other golf courses, in Yorktown and Putnam Valley.
Instead, Mr. Trump put those properties up for sale several years ago, but no deals were completed, and last month, he announced that he was donating the properties -- 436 undeveloped acres -- to New York State for the new Donald J. Trump State Park on two sites. About 45 miles north of Manhattan, one parcel, known as Indian Hill, is on 282 acres straddling the border of Westchester and Putnam; the other, called French Hill, consists of 154 acres in Yorktown.
At Seven Springs, the homes will cover 12,000 to 16,000 square feet on lots of at least 10 acres and sell for about $25 million. Each of the homes, according to Mr. Trump's plans, would also have a pool and tennis court.
Mr. Trump, who recently built the 35-story Trump Tower at City Center, a luxury condo residence in White Plains, and is building another in New Rochelle, has described the county as "the toughest place in the world to build" because of its onerous process of gaining approval from planning boards that must deal with environmentally conscious citizenry.
Some local officials say they were turned off by Mr. Trump's aggressive manner. Linda Cooper, Yorktown's supervisor, said Mr. Trump "wanted to be treated differently" when he applied to build a golf course there.
In Briarcliff, Mr. Trump similarly irritated officials in the manner he presented plans for a golf course on 147 acres. Keith Austin, Briarcliff Manor's mayor at the time, observed then that especially in northern Westchester, where communities are proud of their independence, a superior attitude was not welcomed.
Mr. Trump, who in the mid-1990's, also considered building a condominium complex and later a 47-mansion millionaires' retreat on Davids Island, just off the coast of New Rochelle, said he is not deterred by local resistance.
In particular, he said, community opposition was not a factor in his decision to build houses at Seven Springs instead of a golf course.
Rather, he said, he did not want to draw players away from Trump National Golf Club in Briarcliff Manor, famed for its 13th hole, which features a 101-foot black granite waterfall. That club, which was designed by Tom Fazio and costs $275,000 to join, has 260 members and a capacity for 40 more, said Mr. Trump, who bought the course in 1996. "If I did another golf course at Seven Springs," he said, "I could possibly hurt the other."
In addition to restoring the main mansion, Mr. Trump plans to keep other structures on the property, including the formal garden pavilion, the orangery, an imposing fountain in front of the home, and a Tudor-style residence with a courtyard, known as Nonesuch.
Other structures that will be retained on the site include a root cellar, stone water tower, greenhouse and many stone walls. A number of other structures, mainly farm buildings, are being evaluated and may be demolished.
In addition, 46 acres, about 22 percent of the property, would remain undeveloped as permanent green space.
When completed, Seven Springs is expected to generate about $5 million annually in property tax revenue; for a long time, the estate produced no property taxes because it was owned by a nonprofit institution, which used it as a conference center. Bedford would receive about $2.4 million and North Castle about $2.6 million annually, with most of that money going to the Byram Hills and Bedford school districts.
But before any invitations are sent out for Trump parties at the former Meyer estate, the developer must still win over local officials.
An environmental review that is being conducted jointly by Bedford and North Castle should be completed within the next six months. "This is a much simpler application," than the earlier plans for a golf course, said Donald J. Coe, chairman of the Bedford Planning Board. "We won't have to cut down as many trees."
Hungry for gold, committed to converting savages and seeking a shortcut to the Orient, on May 14, 1607, settlers landed on a marshy peninsula they christened Jamestown.
According to an official account, they came ashore "never to leave." Except for one thing. By the end of the 17th century, after creating a legacy that included slavery and profiteering from tobacco, the Jamestown settlement had all but vanished. Jamestown, Va.'s permanent population today? Two — an archaeologist and his wife. 
Jamestown has been billed as the nation's birthplace, the first permanent English colony, and has already begun an extended celebration of the site of America's 400th anniversary. 
While plenty of other locations stake a claim, some New Yorkers maintain that if any place deserves to be known as the nation's birthplace, it is New York, population 8.2 million. And a real birthday is almost here. 
Perhaps it slipped your mind, but 2009 is the 400th anniversary of the voyage of Hudson up the river that would within a few years bear his name. It's also 400 years since Champlain sailed down his lake upstate. The 200th anniversary of Robert Fulton's inaugural steamboat voyage up the Hudson in 1807 is also being marked in 2009. 
Kenneth T. Jackson, the Columbia University historian and editor of the Encyclopedia of New York City, doesn't begrudge Jamestown its celebration. It's not that Jamestown wasn't important, he says. Just that the contrast with New York couldn't be greater.
"In Jamestown, they discover a town that disappears into the mud," Professor Jackson said. "New York becomes the greatest city in the world. The Hudson becomes the river west, the river of empire."
Not surprising, Barbara C. Fratianni, executive director of the state's Hudson Fulton Champlain Quadricentennial Commission, agrees. "New York has never been given the credit that it's due," she said. "They went to Jamestown but never stayed there. New York was the entryway." 
So far, though, plans and resources for New York's celebration pale in comparison with Virginia's, where scholars, archaeologists, civic boosters and the tourism industry have diligently joined forces to mount an 18-month celebration. Just last week, a new exhibition center opened there. 
"Every American should visit here," said Elizabeth Kostelny, executive director of the Association for the Preservation of Virginia Antiquities. "This is where our nation began."
But Kent Barwick, the president of the Municipal Art Society in New York, described Jamestown, half-jokingly, as "a swamp" and said its "place in history, the present and the future is not comparable" to New York's. The Hudson celebration, he said, "gives us an opportunity to reclaim the river." 
Ms. Fratianni's commission began a Web site on the anniversary this month (www.exploreny400.com). Plans for a federal commission are being drafted. Separately, a joint American-Dutch group called Henry Hudson 400 is planning commemorations in Amsterdam and New York to evoke the legacy of New Netherlands, which, once permanent settlers began arriving in 1624, has included Dutch names sprinkled throughout gazetteers and street signs, cole slaw, bowling and the ethnic and racial diversity that distinguished New York from most other New World settlements.
 The New York State Library and the Holland Society of New York have been sponsoring the research of Charles T. Gehring, who has been translating Dutch colonial records for the New Netherland Project. 
In 1909, less than two decades after Chicago stole New York's thunder with the Columbian Exposition, the 300th anniversary of Hudson's voyage up the river was an extravaganza that lasted two weeks. Six years after his first flight, Wilbur Wright flew up the Hudson from Governors Island to Grant's Tomb and back. Hundreds of vessels paraded up the river, including a replica of Hudson's ship, the Half Moon, which, unfortunately, sailed smack into the facsimile of Fulton's Clermont. 
In "The New World," Terence Malik's recent film about Jamestown, the role of the colonists' lead ship was actually played by a new Half Moon replica, which, captained by William T. Reynolds, director of the New Netherland Museum in Albany, normally plies the Hudson.
In 1909, Americans looked back 300 years, to when the Half Moon's mate wrote that the first New Yorkers weren't all that different from today's — at least on one count: "They desire clothes," the journal said, "and are very civil." 
They also looked ahead, to 2009. Stephen Chalmers, a New York Times reporter turned novelist, drolly predicted the obsolescence of the automobile and the triumph of pedestrians, and a race by air to Chicago and back by competing pilots from Hoboken and from Mars. 
The chief controversy then was whether Hudson, who was English but was commissioned on this voyage by the Dutch East India Company, should be referred to as Hendrik or Henry. 
This time, there's no such controversy — "we call him Henry," Ms. Fratianni said — although there might be some confusion again over a name, since the Hudson Fulton Champlain initials evoke not so much the state's rich heritage as the Household Finance Corporation. "It's important that we celebrate New York's place in history," Ms. Fratianni said. "Life in America started right here in New York City."

Pedro Luis Ferrer
The Cuban singer-songwriter Pedro Luis Ferrer makes his music from a remarkably broad position: his poetry reorders language and emotions, and his composing, half of it in an invented hybrid style he calls Changüisa, combines traditional song forms from different parts of Cuba. "Natural" (Escondido) is the latest astonishment from his home studio in Havana, with Mr. Ferrer leading a tight little acoustic band on the guitar and tres, and Lena Ferrer, his daughter, singing with him in close harmony. (Anyone slightly curious needs to hear her voice: it is like oxygen.) Known in the past for a slight edge of protest — for which he has been partly censored by his country's government — Mr. Ferrer records songs that are consistently too smart for dogma. One deals with a party where young women turn into Martians, one deals comically with the idea of a cold wife, one with the cliché of history repeating itself, one with the agony of accepting one's fate. All are both more and less than they seem. 
Leron Thomas
"Dirty Draws Vol. 1" (A.D.D. Music), rawly self-produced, seems as if it started as a jazz musician's way to channel his artistic frustrations. Leron Thomas is a young trumpeter in New York, originally from Houston, who like everyone else is having a hard time trying to figure out where jazz is going next and who wants to listen. (Lately he's been heard in some of Roy Hargrove's and Charles Tolliver's large ensembles.) But he turned his frustrations into something new. Instead of spraying considerable trumpet-playing skills all over yet another basic post-bop jazz quartet record, Mr. Thomas took a hard left turn. Many of the tracks here are minimalist voice-and-bass daydreams with jazz changes, raps, a country song, a vocal ballad with bass and piano but no drums (he's a so-so singer but with musical smarts), scabrous jokes about sex and race (some involving a character he names Token) and scandalous put-downs of neo-soul singers he lambastes as trying to impress "a father they never had" (Marvin Gaye or whoever). The serious jazz stuff finally arrives on the last few tracks, with a quintet that includes the saxophonist Marcus Strickland and the drummer Eric Harland along with Mr. Thomas on trumpet. All in all, Mr. Thomas seems to have no fear. It's intelligent, casual, a little nuts and completely entertaining. (Available at cdbaby.com.)
Ignacio Berroa
If you want to understand the new Latin jazz — which is one of the almost measurably vital things going on now in jazz — you might as well start with the drummers. This makes Ignacio Berroa quite important. Mr. Berroa left Cuba for the United States in 1980, finding work with Dizzy Gillespie, Tito Puente and many others. His impressive new record, "Codes" (Blue Note), with a distinct arrangement idea on every track, lays out different kinds of rhythmic feel along a vast spectrum. It features the pianist Gonzalo Rubalcaba — he is also the producer — and some of the music proceeds in ways you might associate with him: slow and nearly classical, or hard-slapping, metrically tricky funk. But what makes Mr. Berroa stand out among other Cuban drummers is how deeply he has also mastered the looser feel of American jazz drumming. He proves it with his playing on "Realidad y Fantasia," a remarkable type of generous ballad-swing, made with brushes, that may be a dying art.
Tony Allen
The drummer from Fela Kuti's bands in the 1960's and 1970's and the key to what came to be called Afrobeat, Tony Allen became masterly at a light approach, neatly chopped up among polyrhythms, both hands delivering constant beats. Some of his recent albums produced in Europe, like "Black Voices" and "Homecooking," added guests from British and American pop, expanding instrumentation and using producers to renovate the sound. The new one, "Lagos No Shaking" (Honest Jon's), begins and ends with the band itself. It was produced in Lagos, Nigeria, Mr. Allen's hometown, and if you like the old Fela records, you'll be happy. The arrangements are similar: intermittent brass charts through the mesmerizing vamps, vocal chants and all. But there are differences too. Bass lines didn't feel this liquid and channel-flooding in the 1970's, and Yinka Davies, the Nigerian soul singer featured on some tracks, has more recent American R&B touches in her voice.
Nancy King
Nancy King, who started her career in the early 1960's in San Francisco and has lived and worked in the Pacific Northwest for much of the time since, has the resources a lot of freshly minted jazz singers are looking for. Still, on "Live at Jazz Standard With Fred Hersch" (MaxJazz), a heavily improvised duet record, she has the nerve to subtract about half of her vocal projection. She is a musician who sounds like an instrument, and she can bring to mind Betty Carter, who pushed scat singing into a really personal area, turning eccentricity into hard-practiced style. For his part, Mr. Hersch has long established that he can be wizardly on ballads and standards. The two musicians just concentrate through the music, setting each other up for new roads of harmony and rhythm. It's music of high achievement, and very personal.

STAMFORD
PROLIFERATING condominium developments routinely jam the agendas of Stamford's planning and zoning boards, but few attract as much attention as the Trump Parc tower, now approaching the end of the approval process. 
By the weight of its name alone, this proposed tower has generated both intense enthusiasm and sour skepticism about its effect on the city's downtown core. Even more consequential than Donald J. Trump's emergence on the Stamford skyline, however, is the project's proposed height. 
The developers — Thomas Rich of Stamford and Louis Cappelli, of White Plains — want to amend Stamford's downtown zoning regulations to allow this residential tower to be built 70 feet taller than the city's current limit of 330 feet. A slender high-rise designed by Costas Kondylis, the architect for Trump World Tower near the United Nations in Manhattan, Trump Parc would sit on a half-acre of now-vacant land next to a Target store at the corner of Washington Boulevard and Broad Street. 
Currently, Stamford's tallest structure is Landmark Tower, a commercial building measuring 270 feet. At 400 feet above the sidewalk, Trump Parc would be within the range of two major Trump developments over the New York border in Westchester County: the 350-foot Trump Tower in White Plains and the 435-foot Trump Plaza under construction in downtown New Rochelle. 
Yet in downtown Stamford, less ambitious high-rise residential projects have proved notoriously risky. The Classic and the Biltmore apartment buildings were financial flops when they first opened in the late 1980's, noted Richard Redniss, a longtime Stamford land-use consultant and an adviser on the Trump Parc project. Both have been converted to condominiums. 
More recently, soaring construction costs have contributed to delays in development of the 18-story Highgrove condominium project on Forest Street. Progress on City Place, a 100-unit building on Washington Boulevard, has also been slow.
Trump Parc's backers are banking on the combination of local expertise with a powerful brand name to enable the project to flourish. The F. D. Rich Company has developed much of downtown Stamford over the last three decades, while Cappelli Enterprises is a partner with Mr. Trump on the White Plains and New Rochelle towers.
 The Trump organization will aid in design and marketing. "I don't think it would work without my name," Mr. Trump said. "My name has become so synonymous with great buildings that I sell with people not even seeing what they're buying." 
Marketing potential aside, however, city planning officials say they are less impressed with the Trump name than with the building's design. "We're very excited about the architecture of the building," said Robin Stein, chief of the city's land use bureau. "We think it's superb." 
Though the Planning Board, downtown merchants and economic development groups have also been effusive, the Zoning Board has been proved more of a hurdle for the project. Members are mulling not whether Stamford is ready for a higher high-rise, but whether the developers have chosen the right spot. 
"I'm not against high-rise development," said one member, Harry Parson Jr., who has lived in Stamford for 33 years. "But we have to pick and choose where it's going to be. If it's in the right place, great." 
The half-acre Trump Parc site is part of a 2.7-acre parcel that the Rich company owns jointly with Target. The property is landscaped with grass, ornamental trees and park benches, but Mr. Rich said his intent was always to develop the site. Plans call for 185 units, most with one or two bedrooms, averaging about 1,500 square feet. 
Bernard Simpkin, a 20-year resident of Stamford who moved from the Upper West Side of Manhattan, said the proposed tower "would look ridiculous" looming over Target and, across the street, the smaller building housing a satellite campus of the University of Connecticut. Mr. Simpkin is among a handful of residents who have complained about the project in letters to the local newspaper, The Advocate. The newspaper's editorial page has urged the Zoning Board to ensure that the project fits the city, "not the other way around." 
Mr. Rich says such comments fail to appreciate the project's potential positive contribution to the city. Seven additional stories is a minor tradeoff for the litany of benefits, he said. Aside from a $3.5 million contribution to the city's affordable housing fund and $1 million a year in additional property tax revenue, Trump Parc will bring badly needed housing to a growing downtown, he said. 
Building housing downtown will help to relieve the congestion on Connecticut highways by putting commuters within walking distance of the train station, Mr. Rich said. 
Growth in the city's financial services industries is also fueling demand for high-quality housing downtown. GE Capital and UBS will soon be joined by the Royal Bank of Scotland, which is expected to bring some 3,000 jobs to Stamford when it completes its North American headquarters on Washington Boulevard.
"The only solution for our desire to nurture and grow and stabilize our commercial base is to provide housing downtown," Mr. Rich said. 
Compared with a number of other high-end condominium projects on the drawing boards for downtown, Trump Parc will have a broader market reach, Mr. Rich asserts, because many of its units will be comparatively smaller. Though the average price at Trump Parc is expected to be just under $1 million, some units will be priced as low as $550,000. In contrast, the average price of a home or condo in Stamford exceeds $700,000. 
"I don't understand how anybody could be opposed to this," he said.
Still, Mr. Stein, the land use chief, hears the "so-called buzz" on the streets. "Some people think it's a gorgeous building in the wrong place," he said. "Some don't like Trump; some don't want tall buildings period." 
Without the extra floors at Trump Parc, the project becomes marginal, Mr. Rich said, because profits from higher-priced units at the top help cover costs. 
As for the Zoning Board, members are readying for some long meetings. "There will be some knock-down, drag-out discussions about whether to go ahead with this project," Mr. Parson said. 
STAMFORD - PROLIFERATING condominium developments routinely jam the agendas of Stamford's planning and zoning boards, but few attract as much attention as the Trump Parc tower, now approaching the end of the approval process.
By the weight of its name alone, this proposed tower has generated both intense enthusiasm and sour skepticism about its effect on the city's downtown core. Even more consequential than Donald J. Trump's emergence on the Stamford skyline, however, is the project's proposed height.
The developers -- Thomas Rich of Stamford and Louis Cappelli, of White Plains -- want to amend Stamford's downtown zoning regulations to allow this residential tower to be built 70 feet taller than the city's current limit of 330 feet. A slender high-rise designed by Costas Kondylis, the architect for Trump World Tower near the United Nations in Manhattan, Trump Parc would sit on a half-acre of now-vacant land next to a Target store at the corner of Washington Boulevard and Broad Street.
Currently, Stamford's tallest structure is Landmark Tower, a commercial building measuring 270 feet. At 400 feet above the sidewalk, Trump Parc would be within the range of two major Trump developments over the New York border in Westchester County: the 350-foot Trump Tower in White Plains and the 435-foot Trump Plaza under construction in downtown New Rochelle.
Yet in downtown Stamford, less ambitious high-rise residential projects have proved notoriously risky. The Classic and the Biltmore apartment buildings were financial flops when they first opened in the late 1980's, noted Richard Redniss, a longtime Stamford land-use consultant and an adviser on the Trump Parc project. Both have been converted to condominiums.
More recently, soaring construction costs have contributed to delays in development of the 18-story Highgrove condominium project on Forest Street. Progress on City Place, a 100-unit building on Washington Boulevard, has also been slow.
Trump Parc's backers are banking on the combination of local expertise with a powerful brand name to enable the project to flourish. The F. D. Rich Company has developed much of downtown Stamford over the last three decades, while Cappelli Enterprises is a partner with Mr. Trump on the White Plains and New Rochelle towers.

JERUSALEM — Donald Trump has completed buying property in Ramat Gan, Israel, and plans to build a 70-story luxury-housing tower to be the nation's tallest building.
The $300 million Trump Tower proj-ect will be the billionaire property de-veloper's first project in Israel, Trump said in an e-mailed statement June 25. The structure is planned in part-nership with U.S.-based Crescent Heights Investments on the site of the old Elite chocolate factory, adjacent to the Israel Diamond Exchange.
"I am confident that Israel's future can only go one direction, and that is up," Trump said in the statement, adding that he had negotiated for the site for more than a year. "We are devel-oping a signature landmark property so impressive that it will set a new stan-dard for luxury condominium living in Israel."
Rising demand and a lack of supply have resulted in increasing real estate prices in Israel, HSBC Holdings Plc said in a recent report. The upper end of the market and properties in the sought-after central portion of the country, in cities like Ramat Gan, are the main beneficiaries of this trend, ac-cording to the report.
Strauss-Elite, Israel's second-largest foodmaker, agreed in March to sell the site to Trump for $44 million.
Crescent Heights, established 25 years ago, has built luxury housing projects in major U.S. cities including New York, Los Angeles and Chicago. N.S. Tito Architects represents Cres-cent Heights in Israel.
A nation of television watchers, we adore our remote controls and only wish they were simpler yet more powerful. Why is Adam Sandler trying to talk us out of that? His new film, "Click," wants to be "It's a Wonderful Life" for the age of TIVO. Even the film's trailer gives away its slow-down-and-savor-the-moment message. Mr. Sandler plays a workaholic dad whose magical remote lets him fast-forward through fights with his wife or mute, dreary family dinners, only to discover that the gadget — symbolizing with a bludgeon all the evils of our high-tech, faster-than-fast life — zooms too quickly through precious years with his children. 
Nothing could be more bogus; as if anyone in Hollywood really wants to slow down. The true message — wouldn't it be great to have that remote? — shines through anyway. And it's not just the filmmakers who are in on the sham. "Click" is the kind of film that relies on an unspoken compact between the movie and its audience (like viewers who made "Click" the top film at the box office last weekend). We all pretend, with a giant wink, to embrace an inspirational message we think we ought to accept, while actually reveling in the satisfying fantasy of the very thing that's supposed to be bad. The Sandler character stops time, hits his boss in the head, and no one can even see him; that's what the trailer sells. The wailing about those lost childhood moments is secondary. 
Saying one thing but selling another has always been most blatant in anti-violence films that glory in bloody action scenes. Last year the Nicolas Cage film "Lord of War" cloaked its anti-gun-running message in a stream of fast-paced shootouts. 
But more and more comedies are punishing their characters' ambition and success even when that successful life is portrayed as desirable. A long way from the 1980's and more ambivalent films like "Wall Street," which preached humility in the end but left room to admire a character who said, "Greed is good," these new movies speak to a cultural moment that has Enron executives as villains. 
 "The Devil Wears Prada" (opening on Friday), hoping to lure an audience of would-be fashionistas, immerses viewers in the behind-the-scenes glamour of a high-gloss magazine resembling Vogue in everything except its name. Why does the magazine's editor (Meryl Streep, purring her whim-of-iron commands) have to be so venal that her put-upon assistant (Anne Hathaway) fears becoming like her? 
Anyone who's seen the promos knows that the assistant doesn't need a simpler life; she needs a better boss. And what the Sandler character really wants is a remote he can control, instead of one with a mind of its own. The films' fraudulent messages, though, suggest that audiences should and probably do feel guilty for indulging in such selfish fantasies. 
In "Click" Mr. Sandler follows the pattern of some of Jim Carrey's biggest hits. In fact, Mr. Carrey's career offers a template of how the bogus-message genre works. In "Liar Liar" (1997) he plays a workaholic (like the father in "Click"), whose 5-year-old wishes his dad would tell the truth for one day. The father, a lawyer who lives by lying, ostensibly learns to value honesty and his son, but the selling point is that being honest puts him in a string of outrageous comic situations. Learning to value honesty is simply a way to wrap things up. 
The megahit "Bruce Almighty" (2003) makes Mr. Carrey an ambitious television reporter who is passed over for the anchorman's job and decides that God is out to get him. When God (Morgan Freeman) turns over his powers to Bruce (Mr. Carrey), he trains his dog to use the toilet, gives his girlfriend bigger breasts, gets the anchor job. Well, who wouldn't start by exacting revenge on the nincompoop who got the job with his name on it? Naturally, Bruce learns that he should use his powers selflessly. When God extols such daily miracles as "a teenager who says no to drugs and yes to education," the slapstick Carrey movie begins to sound like a public-service ad, but that turn comes so late that it hardly matters. 
It's not surprising that the writers of "Click," Steve Koren and Mark O'Keefe, also wrote "Bruce" (along with Steve Oedekerk). They are obviously revisiting the scene of their success, giving another hero supernatural powers only to have him appreciate being human. But "Click" doesn't wait for the end to tack on its preachy message. Three-quarters of the way through, the Sandler character has fast-forwarded into darker, sadder terrain, where he faces illness and death. The movie changes from an Adam Sandler comedy to a time-traveling film about loss. It even pushes the audience's emotional buttons more effectively than this season's other time-traveling melodrama, "The Lake House." The last stretch of "Click" is suited to the "Lake House" audience, but if viewers hungry for a goofy Sandler comedy suddenly morph into people who buy the sentimental part, that really will be magic. 
The be-careful-what-you-wish-for film works best when there is no phony message. Oddly, Mr. Carrey can point the way there, too. In Michel Gondry's sweet "Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind" (2004), Mr. Carrey's character and Kate Winslet's erase the painful memories of their romance, using some new-fangled science. But Charlie Kaufman's script doesn't wag its finger at their desire to avoid pain, or offer a cautionary message about the evil fallout of technology. Instead, the characters are profoundly sad for reasons they can't remember, and the film's endless loop of a plot suggests that they are fated to be together, surmounting whatever the high-tech world throws their way. 
"Eternal Sunshine" is a far more sophisticated film than "Click," of course, and its entire United States run didn't match the $40 million "Click" made on its opening weekend. So far, the complicity between audience and movie has held up for "Click." The real test may come this weekend, the movie's second, after word has gotten out that the entire last section tries to make you cry. That may be a twist the knowing wink was never meant to cover.

 The World Computer-Bridge Championship has been organized by Al Levy of Commack, N.Y., since its inception in 1997. Also a member of the World Bridge Federation executive council, Levy declared four hearts in the diagramed deal during the Imp Pairs at Verona, Italy, last month. His partner was George Retek of Montreal, a vice president of the federation's executive council.
 Four hearts was the final contract at 28 of the 71 tables in play, twice being doubled. One declarer made an overtrick (maybe an opponent reneged), 5 got home, and 22 went down.
 Levy doubled East's weak-two opening because he had a strong hand that was playable in two suits. (Eight pairs failed in six clubs.) North's jump to three no-trump expressed his values, although he would have liked a spade bolster like the ten. (Three diamonds would have promised no points.) Passing over three no-trump works fine here, but South converted to four hearts, and North, with a singleton heart, had no incentive to move higher.
 Declarer won the first trick on the board with the spade king and played a trump to the jack, king and ace. West continued with his second spade, South winning in his hand and cashing the heart queen to get the bad news. With the 7-6-4-2 of hearts left, sitting under West's 10-9-5, declarer realized that he would need an endplay to avoid three more heart losers. This required reducing his trump length by one, making it the same as West's.
 South took his three top clubs, played a diamond to dummy's king, cashed the diamond ace, discarding his last club, and ruffed a diamond in his hand. It was now Trick 11. Levy led his heart seven, endplaying West. He won with his nine and cashed the ten, but South's six beat West's five for the final trick.
 Note that it does not help West to duck the first round of hearts. Declarer would immediately continue with a low heart from his hand, then play in similar fashion to produce an endplay where he would lead low from the Q-7-6 of hearts into West's A-10-9.

To the Editor:
Re "He Wasn't Thinking Straight. So How Do You Get Through?" (Cases, July 11): Dr. Sandeep Jauhar writes that his "patient did not meet the standards for having the ability to make decisions."
I am not sure what "standards" he had in mind. As far as I can tell, he thought the patient ought to have angioplasty, and his otherwise normal and sane patient did not want it. In other words, the patient could not think straight because he disagreed with the doctor. Oy!
My good dentist recently recommended a root canal. I had a layman's intuition that the trouble did not require such a drastic measure. I declined the treatment. Fortunately, my dentist didn't call security to restrain me.
As it turned out, I was right about the tooth and my dentist wrong. But even if it had been the other way around, my decision about my body surely should trump the doctor's.

CHICAGO, July 18 (AP)  Malachi Thompson, a trumpeter who was a leading figure on Chicago’s experimental jazz scene, died on Sunday at his home on the South Side of Chicago. He was 56.
His death followed a long battle with cancer, Bob Koester, founder of Thompson’s record label, Delmark, said.
Doctors told Mr. Thompson in 1989 that he had a year to live after he was found to have T-cell lymphoma. He later said the diagnosis transformed his music and inspired him to record “Lift Every Voice,” a 1993 album that explored the roots of black musical culture.
“I’d have to say it was because of my cancer that I realized I had to start doing things before it was too late,” he told The Chicago Tribune in 1993. “People don’t really think about their mortality when they’re in their 30’s, but I had to.”
Mr. Thompson was born in Princeton, Ky., and moved to Chicago with his family when he was a child. When he was 11, his mother took him to hear Count Basie’s band at the Regal Theater. 
“Those screaming trumpets shook me,” he said. “I never had heard a sound like that, and I decided right then that I had to get a trumpet.”
He apprenticed in Chicago nightclubs and joined the influential Association for the Advancement of Creative Musicians there in 1968. In the 1970’s he moved to New York, where he performed with Joe Henderson, Jackie McLean and Lester Bowie. His band, Brass Proud, worked frequently in Europe.
Mr. Thompson had been scheduled to appear at this year’s Chicago Jazz Festival.
He is survived by a son, a daughter and two sisters.

THE one positive thing about the power failure in Queens is that no other areas of the interconnected electric grid were affected by it. Still, it’s the grid’s reliability that’s in most danger today. Whatever improvements are needed at the distribution level, the reliability of the grid is deteriorating, and a blackout like the one in August 2003 will surely be replicated. 
The reasons are many, but all come back to a mismanaged attempt to deregulate electric power supply.
Federal agencies and industry groups, whose mantra is “the market,” have taken control. Policy decisions promote commercial interests, not customer reliability. There’s even a major push to lower reliability standards to allow greater commercial use of the grid. 
The Energy Policy Act that Congress passed last year in an effort to expand energy production will do nothing for reliability. Its touted requirement for mandatory standards for reliability is meaningless; standards have been mandatory in most parts of North America (including New York) for years. 
When the laws of economics and the laws of physics collide, physics always wins.

BOSTON — One dreams of returning to the university. The tree-shadowed walkways. The shared goals of learning. The sexual and somatic adventuring. Ah, the student life.
In early May, I received an unsolicited invitation to join Trump University, which sounds like the kind of institution you might find parodied on the comics page. (In fact, it has been mocked in "Doonesbury.")
This wasn't like the letters my sons received when they were in high school, inviting them to apply to universities. This was an acceptance letter, a "personal invite" from Donald Trump, contingent on my coughing up $40. Which I did.
You probably think I've been kicking back at my summer job bagging groceries while classes were out of session, but Trump U doesn't slow down.
"Focus is very important, and momentum," TU chairman Donald tells us in one of his many communications. TU is about learning, 24/7, with no shortage of face time with Himself. If you call watching little streaming video clips of Donald pontificating face time. Which, in a sense, it is.
His face. Your time. Your money.
Here's what you get for the initial buy-in at TU: video Trumptalks on subjects like "Dealing With Failure," "Creating a Great Brand," "Career Advice," and "Salesmanship." Sample pabulum: "There's nothing like a great salesperson. I put them up with the greatest people in the world."
You also receive a subscription to "Inside the Trump Tower," a newsletter chock full of windy little essays.
I especially enjoyed the moronic outing, "The End of the MBA is Nigh!" by business guru and self-promoter extraordinaire Tom Peters. It's a quick piece of nothing fluff that never mentions the author's own MBA from Stanford University.
All over the Web site - because that's all TU is, a Web site (www.trumpuniversity.com) - Chairman Trump rattles on about the value of extramural "education" like TU.
To recycle the slur often directed at President George W. Bush, Trump is a man who was born on third base who later made much of hitting a home run; his father was a successful New York real estate magnate and Donald has a graduate degree from the Wharton School.
Inevitably, he blogs: "Britney Spears has seen better days. She performed four or five years ago at the Trump Taj Mahal and she was great. Now it seems as if everything's slipping away from her. Britney, don't let that happen. Don't let it slip away. Keep your head on straight." Can you imagine Larry Summers, the former president of Harvard University, bloviating about Madonna? Maybe he should have.
And, of course, Trump's favorite subject is ... Trump. In one of his homilies, he celebrates the Top Ten Books on Entrepreneurship. The first six books were authored by, yes, Donald Trump.
Another "benefit" of matriculating at Trump U is receiving a near-constant stream of e-mails and occasional phone calls from TU staffers trying to sell you more courses.
Shortly after I enrolled, the TU president, Michael Sexton, invited me "to purchase a remarkable audio/video course available exclusively from Trump University. For the first time ever, Donald Trump has created a complete eight-week course on how to get rich." I continue to receive invitations to enroll at TU, even though I am already a student. A slip-up at the dean's office, I guess.
I called Sexton, and he picked up on the first ring. From his office at the Trump Building on 40 Wall Street, Sexton semi-apologized for the blizzard of come-ons I'd been receiving.
"We want to get people to take the first step and enroll for a course," he explained. He said TU had "perhaps been a little overexuberant" in hyping its exciting new products. "We've had feedback that we should be cutting down on the touch points," which I am guessing is businesspeak for "people have been complaining about the spam."
"We don't spam anybody," he insisted.
Just hours after he said this, I received yet another spam invitation for me to join Trump University. I forwarded the e-mail to him, with the comment, "Michael, if this isn't spam, what is?" I have yet to hear back from him, but I know how busy university presidents are these days.

CAIRO
SHE grew up in Cairo with the privileges that go to the daughter of a military officer, attended a university and landed a job in marketing. He grew up in a poor village of dusty unpaved roads, where young men work long hours in a brick factory while dreaming of getting a government job that would pay $90 a month.
 But Jihan Mahmoud, 24, from the middle-class neighborhood of Heliopolis, and Madah Ali Muhammad, 23, from a village in the Nile Delta, have come to the exact same conclusion about what they and their country need: a strong Islamic political movement. 
“I have more faith in Islam than in my state; I have more faith in Allah than in Hosni Mubarak,” Ms. Mahmoud said, referring to the president of Egypt. “That is why I am proud to be a Muslim.”
The war in Lebanon, and the widespread conviction among Arabs that Hezbollah won that war by bloodying Israel, has fostered and validated those kinds of feelings across Egypt and the region. In interviews on streets and in newspaper commentaries circulated around the Middle East, the prevailing view is that where Arab nations failed to stand up to Israel and the United States, an Islamic movement succeeded.
 “The victory that Hezbollah achieved in Lebanon will have earthshaking regional consequences that will have an impact much beyond the borders of Lebanon itself,” Yasser Abuhilalah of Al Ghad, a Jordanian daily, wrote in Tuesday’s issue.
“The resistance celebrates the victory,” read the front-page headline in Al Wafd, an opposition daily in Egypt.
 Hezbollah’s perceived triumph has propelled, and been propelled by, a wave already washing over the region. Political Islam was widely seen as the antidote to the failures of Arab nationalism, Communism, socialism and, most recently, what is seen as the false promise of American-style democracy. It was that wave that helped the banned but tolerated Muslim Brotherhood win 88 seats in Egypt’s Parliament last December despite the government’s violent efforts to stop voters from getting to the polls. It was that wave that swept Hamas into power in the Palestinian government in January, shocking Hamas itself.
“We need an umbrella,” said Mona Mahmoud, 40, Jihan’s older sister. “In the 60’s, Arabism was the umbrella. We had a cause. Now we lack an umbrella. We feel lost in space. We need to be affiliated to something. Usually in our part of the world, because of what religion means to us, we immediately resort to it.”
The lesson learned by many Arabs from the war in Lebanon is that an Islamic movement, in this case Hezbollah, restored dignity and honor to a bruised and battered identity. People in Egypt still talk painfully about the loss to Israel in 1967, a loss that was the beginning of the end of pan-Arabism as an ideology to unite the region and define its people.
Hezbollah’s perceived victory has highlighted, and to many people here validated, the rise of another unifying ideology, a kind of Arab-Islamic nationalism. On the street it has even seemed to erase divisions between Islamic sects, like Sunni and Shiite. At the moment, the Hezbollah leader, Sheik Hassan Nasrallah, is widely viewed as a pan-Arab Islamic hero.
 “The losers are going to be the Arab regimes, U.S.A. and Israel,” said Dr. Fares Braizat of the Center for Strategic Studies at the University of Jordan. “The secular resistance movements are gone. Now there are the Islamists coming in. So the new nationalism is going to be religious nationalism, and one of the main reasons is dignity. People want their dignity back.”
The terms Islamic nationalism and pan-Islamism have a negative connotation in the West, where they are associated with fundamentalism and terrorism. But that is increasingly not the case in Egypt. Under the dual pressures of foreign military attacks in the region and a government widely viewed as corrupt and illegitimate, Islamic groups are seen by many people as incorruptible, disciplined, efficient and caring. A victory for Hezbollah in Lebanon is by extension a victory for the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt.
“People will say Hezbollah achieved a very good thing, so why should we mistrust the Muslim Brotherhood,” said Hassan Naffa, a professor of political science at Cairo University.
There is a wide diversity of views and agendas under the pan-Islamic-Arab umbrella. But as is often the case in politically aligned movements, those differences are easily papered over when that movement is in the opposition.
 “Hezbollah is a resistance movement that has given us a solution,” said Yomana Samaha, a radio talk-show host in Cairo who identified herself as secular and a supporter of separating religion and government. But when asked if she would vote for a Muslim Brotherhood candidate in Egypt, she said “Yeah, why not?”
It was an answer she seemed reluctant — but relieved — to state.
“If they have a solution,” she repeated, “why not?”
A solution to what? 
“Loss of dignity,” said Mona Mahmoud, who is her friend.
 Concepts of individual and collective identity are fluid here. During the British occupation of Egypt, a rise in Egyptian nationalism helped lead to independence in the early 1900’s. After the revolution of 1952, Gamal Abdel Nasser led the country and the region to seek unity under the banner of Arabism. That was a theme trumpeted by leaders from Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi in Libya to Hafez al-Assad in Syria to Saddam Hussein in Iraq.
 But according to many political scientists and intellectuals, the glue of pan-Arabism began to weaken in Egypt after defeat in the Arab-Israel War of 1967, a decline that quickened through the 1970’s and into the 1980’s. 
 “People think that this defeat was a punishment from God because we drifted far from the teachings of Islam,” said Gamal Badawi, an Egyptian historian.
Since then there has been a steady and visible change in many Egyptians’ relationship to political Islam. It is not that Egyptians are suddenly more religious, political analysts said. This has always been a religious country. It is that they are more apt to define themselves by their faith. On the streets, that is most evident in the number of women — an overwhelming majority — who cover their heads with Islamic headscarves, a sign not just of individual conviction but also of peer pressure. 
“The failure of pan-Arabism, the lack of democracy, and corruption — this drives people to an extent of despair where they start to find the solution in religion,” said Gamal el-Ghitany, editor of Akhbar al-Adab, a literary magazine distributed in Egypt. 
Echoing that view, Diaa Rashwan, an expert in Islamic movements and analyst with the government-financed Center for Political and Strategic Studies in Cairo, said, “People have come to identify themselves more as Muslims during the last five years in response to the U.S.-led ‘war on terrorism’ which Egyptians frequently feel is a discriminatory campaign targeting Muslims and Islam worldwide.” 
 But it is not just outside pressures that have pressed so many people of this nation, and this region, toward that view. The events that helped shape Mr. Muhammad’s world view from his Delta village illustrate the way the government of Egypt also plays a role.
Last December Mr. Muhammad’s uncle, Mustafa Abdel Salam, 61, was shot in the head and killed by the Egyptian police as he was going to pray at a mosque, according to witnesses, including Mr. Muhammad and other villagers. The killing occurred on the last day of voting in Egypt’s parliamentary elections, a months-long process that was marred by police officers who were ordered to block voters from getting to the polls in many districts. The government grew concerned after candidates affiliated with the Muslim Brotherhood began winning in record numbers. While the brotherhood is banned, candidates affiliated with the organization ran as independents.
The government says that the police did not fire live ammunition at citizens, but many people were killed and doctors and witnesses — including Western diplomats — said that the police did fire live rounds into people trying to vote. After the election was over and Mr. Abdel Salam was buried, the brotherhood-affiliated candidate visited the family to offer his condolences and help. The winning candidate, from the governing National Democratic Party, did not visit.
Mr. Muhammad said that the whole experience strengthened his conviction that “Islam is the solution” — a phrase that is the slogan of the Muslim Brotherhood. “Our voice is not heard,” said Mr. Muhammad. “It is only the authorities who have a say. The smallest thing, like we go to vote, and we get beaten. So I will hold on to my religion, and that’s it.”

Having a high body mass index increases the risk of disease, health authorities agree. But in people over 75, the proportion of height-to-weight appears to be less important than the waist-to-hip ratio as a predictor of mortality, British researchers report.
They recorded the height, weight, and waist and hip measurements of almost 15,000 people over 75 and assessed their health. Then they followed them for an average of six years, during which 6,649 died. 
After adjusting for other factors, they found that a high body mass index, or B.M.I., was not associated with death from circulatory disease, cancer, respiratory disease or all causes considered together. 
In fact, men with a B.M.I. below 23 and women below 22.3 were the most likely to die during the course of the study. (In younger people, an index reading over 25 is believed to put them at risk.) 
In the older group, a high waist-to-hip ratio — waist measurement divided by hip measurement — was a more accurate predictor of disease risk. Those with the highest waist-to-hip ratio (closer to 1) were 40 percent more likely to die from cardiovascular disease than those with the lowest (about 0.8). 
The study was published in the August issue of The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition.
Astrid E. Fletcher, the senior author of the study, said the findings suggested a need for fresh thinking. 
 “A low B.M.I. is not desirable in older people because it may indicate risk factors such as loss of muscle or poor nutrition,” said Dr. Fletcher, a professor of epidemiology at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine. “Waist-to-hip ratio more accurately reflects excess body fat.”

Maynard Ferguson, whose soaring trumpeting reached the instrument's highest ranges and propelled a musical career of more than 60 years, died Wednesday in Ventura, Calif. He was 78.
The cause was kidney and liver failure, said his personal manager, Steve Schankman.
Mr. Ferguson had a stratospheric style all his own. He possessed "a tremendous breadth of sound and an incomparable tone," said Lew Soloff, a prominent trumpeter who started out with Mr. Ferguson in the mid-1960's. The writer Frank Conroy once noted, "He soared above everything, past high C, into the next octave and a half, where his tone and timbre became unique" -- sometimes reaching, as Mr. Schankman said, "notes so high that only dogs could hear them."
He pleased far more crowds than critics. John S. Wilson, reviewing Mr. Ferguson's big band at the 1959 Newport Jazz Festival for The New York Times, called it "screaming" and "strident." Yet that same year the readers of Down Beat magazine voted the band the world's second-best, outranked only by Count Basie's.
Today, record collectors pay hundreds of dollars for rare Fergusons. "Very few rock superstars can command that kind of prices for used CD's or records," said John Himes, who runs the Maynard Ferguson Album Emporium in Cypress, Calif.
Mr. Ferguson's bands toured ceaselessly, across Asia, Europe and the United States, stopping often at high schools and colleges, where he served as both entertainer and educator. At his last stand -- a six-night booking at the Blue Note in New York, which ended July 23 -- every show sold out. The next week, he completed the last of his roughly 100 recordings; it is to be released this fall.
Walter Maynard Ferguson was born on May 4, 1928, in Verdun, Canada, now part of the city of Montreal. Both his parents were teachers and school administrators. His mother, a former concert violinist, taught him to play at an early age. His father stored school orchestra instruments in the basement, and Mr. Ferguson schooled himself on woodwinds and brass. By 15, he was out of school and into nightclubs, seven days a week.
He came to national attention in 1950 with a four-minute televised cavalcade on "The Ed Sullivan Show," backed by Stan Kenton's big band. After three years with the brass-heavy Kenton band, he did studio work and then, in 1956, formed his own band, which he led for a decade.
After a trip or two to Timothy Leary's consciousness-altering community in Millbrook, N.Y., Mr. Ferguson dissolved his band in 1967 and moved to India for a year. He began a new band in London in 1969, fusing rock and pop into its repertory. His stock with jazz purists fell as he played his versions of hits by the Beatles and Stevie Wonder. But his popularity skyrocketed.
Mr. Ferguson's performance of Leoncavallo's "Pagliacci," an operatic warhorse turned into a disco anthem, was heard at the closing ceremony of the 1976 Olympic Games in Montreal and seen by millions of television viewers. His version of "Gonna Fly Now," the indelible theme from the movie "Rocky," was nominated for a Grammy in 1977.
Mr. Ferguson won his homeland's highest civilian honor, the Order of Canada, in 2005. His wife of 53 years, Flo Ferguson, died that year. He is survived by four daughters, Kim, Lisa, Corby and Wilder, and two grandchildren.
Unlike many bandleaders, Mr. Ferguson rode a bus from stage to stage with his musicians. His tour manager, Ed Sargent, said that he preferred to travel in "a million-dollar rock 'n' roll coach" with his sidemen.
Mr. Schankman, his manager, said that Mr. Ferguson had a cross-country tour set to begin in a few weeks, and pleaded from his deathbed for the shows to go on.
Suburbs pride themselves on using zoning laws to smooth and polish their appearance. Usually they succeed. But two recent cases show how a desire for uniformity can produce a theater of the absurd. 
In Cromwell, a sign advertising the business of Joe Cadieux so vexed one zoning enforcement officer that he ordered it taken down. Mr. Cadieux is 13. The offending hand-lettered sign, advertising “Nite Crawlers,” brought the young entrepreneur about $10 a month in the sale of worms.
 The sign violated local zoning; the order banishing it violated common sense. An appeal, the Cadieux family discovered, would cost more than $100. Fortunately, in protest, other signs popped up in town, saying, for example, “Hug a Worm,” and, our favorite, “Live Worm or Die.” The Planning and Zoning Commission rescinded the order. 
In Westbrook, meanwhile, the first selectman ordered a sign advertising a blood drive removed from Boston Post Road. This time, both the zoning enforcement officer and public works director refused to take down the sign, earning them a few written reprimands and the admiration of nearly everyone else.
Restored to its rightful place, the sign (and the controversy surrounding it) attracted more blood donors than the town had seen in months. 
These episodes were not big deals. But they renew one’s faith in people’s ability to reject rules that violate a basic sense of right and wrong — and to keep a reflexive bureaucracy from having the last word. 
When the village of Briarcliff Manor gave Donald J. Trump permits to renovate and expand the old Briar Hall Country Club in 2000, it imposed a few conditions. Chief among them was the prohibition of golf events that would draw big crowds.
Now Mr. Trump is asking the village to allow an annual women's professional golf tournament at the site, now called the Trump National Golf Club, beginning next summer. The HSBC Women's World Match Play Championship, with a top prize of $500,000, would take place in July or August.
But there are a few sand traps to clear. Michael S. Blau, the village manager, said Briarcliff Manor lawyers were determining whether a tournament would be "appropriate, or even legal," given the restrictions that had been placed on the club.
There is also the matter of neighborhood opposition. Angela Robins, 49, a lawyer who lives on Dalmeny Road on the western edge of the course, said the club had been inattentive to residents' concerns about the broken windows and car dents caused by stray golf balls.
Given that history, Ms. Robins said, she does not have faith in the club's ability to handle the traffic and crowds of a major event. "It's not the worst thing in the world to have a golf tournament," she said. "But you have to manage it."
Carolyn Kepcher, the golf club's chief operating officer, said the club was taking steps to address neighbors' concerns. The tournament, she added, would have a minimal impact on the village.
"We think it's a perfect fit for the community," she said.
The club, which filed an application with village officials to amend its six-year-old special permit on Aug. 10, has pledged to limit attendance to 5,000 spectators per day.
Westchester Community College, about eight miles south of the club in Valhalla, has tentatively agreed to provide parking space for the tournament, said Patrick Hennessey, a college spokesman, with shuttle buses carrying staff and spectators to and from the course.
Stephen E. Cohen, a spokesman for HSBC, the London-based bank that is the sponsor of the tournament, would not confirm that it was considering holding the event at Trump National. He said the bank was still evaluating where it would be played next year. DAVID SCHARFENBERG
Suburbs pride themselves on using zoning laws to smooth and polish their appearance. Usually they succeed. But two recent cases show how a desire for uniformity can produce a theater of the absurd.
In Cromwell, a sign advertising the business of Joe Cadieux so vexed one zoning enforcement officer that he ordered it taken down. Mr. Cadieux is 13. The offending hand-lettered sign, advertising "Nite Crawlers," brought the young entrepreneur about $10 a month in the sale of worms.
The sign violated local zoning; the order banishing it violated common sense. An appeal, the Cadieux family discovered, would cost more than $100. Fortunately, in protest, other signs popped up in town, saying, for example, "Hug a Worm," and, our favorite, "Live Worm or Die." The Planning and Zoning Commission rescinded the order.
In Westbrook, meanwhile, the first selectman ordered a sign advertising a blood drive removed from Boston Post Road. This time, both the zoning enforcement officer and public works director refused to take down the sign, earning them a few written reprimands and the admiration of nearly everyone else.
Restored to its rightful place, the sign (and the controversy surrounding it) attracted more blood donors than the town had seen in months.
These episodes were not big deals. But they renew one's faith in people's ability to reject rules that violate a basic sense of right and wrong -- and to keep a reflexive bureaucracy from having the last word.
 The semifinals of the United States Bridge Federation’s trial to select the U.S.A.-1 team for next year’s Bermuda Bowl ended on Aug. 26. The diagramed deal was Board 108 of 120 in the match between George Jacobs, Steve Garner, Ralph Katz, Zia Mahmood, Michael Rosenberg and Howard Weinstein; and Nick Nickell, Dick Freeman, Bob Hamman, Jeff Meckstroth, Eric Rodwell and Paul Soloway.
 In the Closed Room, Garner had failed in three no-trump after Hamman (East) carefully did not cash his two heart winners for fear of squeezing his partner in the minors.
 In the Open Room, where Zia (West) and Rosenberg took on Meckstroth (North) and Rodwell, the straightforward Stayman auction led to Rodwell’s being the declarer in three no-trump.
 The killing defense is a spade start, East shifting to a heart when in with his ace. But that was impossible for Zia to find. Instead he led his fourth-highest club, South taking East’s eight with his queen.
 Obviously, if declarer had played on clubs, he would have got home, his six beating West’s five on the fourth round of the suit. But naturally Rodwell led the spade jack from his hand. To guarantee defeating the contract West had to play low, letting his partner take the trick and switch to a heart. But Zia went in with his king and continued with his second spade. After East won with his ace, he shifted to the heart deuce, South’s queen losing to West’s king and a second heart going to declarer’s ace. Declarer overtook his spade ten with the board’s queen and cashed the spade nine to give this end position:




 NORTH —  8 7 A Q 8 2 —



 WEST —  —  J 10 7 6 K 5

 EAST —  J 10 9 3 10 9



 SOUTH —  —  K 5 4 A J 6




 Notice that West has been squeezed out of his remaining heart to keep four diamonds and the guarded club king. South led the diamond deuce to his king and cashed the club ace, going down one.
 It was a pity that declarer did not play four rounds of diamonds, trying to endplay West to lead away from his club king into South’s ace-jack tenace. Would Zia have seen the necessity to unblock in diamonds, throwing the ten and jack and keeping the six or seven to underplay the board’s eight on the fourth round? If so, East would have taken the last two tricks with his high hearts for down one. But if Rodwell had intended to take this line of play, presumably he would have led the diamond eight to his king, keeping dummy’s deuce as the throw-in card.
 So the board was flat, but if Rodwell had guessed how to make three no-trump, the Nickell team would have gained 12 international match points and won by 2.





 NORTH Q 9 5 4 8 7 6 3 A Q 8 2 7



 WEST(D) K 2 K 5 4 J 10 7 6 K 5 3 2

 EAST A 7 6 3 J 10 9 2 9 3 10 9 8



 SOUTH J 10 8 A Q K 5 4 A Q J 6 4




 North and South were vulnerable. The bidding:

It’s little wonder that ABC’s mini-series “The Path to 9/11” drew stinging criticism earlier this month for its invented scenes, fabricated dialogue and unsubstantiated accounts of how the Clinton and Bush administrations conducted themselves in the years encompassing the World Trade Center attacks of 1993 and 2001.
A more puzzling question is why ABC spent $30 million on what, since it lacked commercials, amounted to a five-hour public service announcement. 
While the two-night docudrama was shown without a sponsor, ABC did not always intend it to be so. As recently as July, ABC was discussing the possibility of running the program with limited commercials from one or two major sponsors.
The network also saw a potential market in schools. It hired Scholastic Inc., the educational publisher, to create a study guide for high school teachers to go along with the mini-series, a move that implied the network saw a future in DVD sales of the mini-series to schools.
In the end, however, Scholastic scrapped its original study guide and no sponsors stepped up to help ABC defray the cost of the program. While the network did sell foreign rights to the show in a few markets, including Britain, Australia and New Zealand, it was left to shoulder nearly all of the cost by itself. 
Once it became clear that it would have to go without sponsors, ABC began to promote the mini-series as a public service. That decision left the network open to a weighty question: Is it truly a public service if it alienates a significant part of the audience? 
The mini-series drew respectable ratings, coming in second to a football game on NBC on its first night and winning the night on Sept. 11, its second night. But despite drawing an estimated 12 million to 13 million viewers each night, ABC was unable to capitalize on its large audience. 
Typically, big productions like “The Path to 9/11” serve as vehicles for networks to promote their new fall lineup. But by excluding not only commercials but also promotional spots during the broadcast, ABC essentially gave away five hours of network time. 
ABC has repeatedly declined to make its top executives available for interviews in the last two weeks. Asked specifically last week about the business decisions that went into the mini-series, ABC offered a statement on Friday. 
“Throughout the history of the broadcast business, programming decisions have been made based not only on their commercial nature, but also on their relevance and potential public interest,” the statement said. “In greenlighting ‘The Path to 9/11,’ our commercial expectations very much took into account the nature of the movie. We proceeded with the project because of our belief in the importance of the subject.”
In couching its mini-series as a public service, however, ABC took on a burden that a drama, by its nature, is ill equipped to shoulder, according to one critic. 
“Saying it is a public service is the same as claiming ideological ownership,” said Robert J. Thompson, director of the Center for the Study of Popular Television at Syracuse University. “If it is being packaged as a way to expose people to the contents of the 9/11 Commission report, and you’re encouraging it to be used in schools, then you do have to present it as factual. It doesn’t do a good job of that.”
After former Clinton administration officials began to complain that the invented scenes and made-up dialogue presented an inaccurate picture and showed them as being less than vigilant in their pursuit of Osama bin Laden, the network added a disclaimer, saying that “for dramatic and narrative purposes, the movie contains fictionalized scenes, composite and representative characters and dialogue, as well as time compression.”
The decision to run the mini-series without commercials and an effort to edit out some of the disputed scenes appear to have been prompted by complaints to Robert A. Iger, the chief executive of the Walt Disney Company, which owns ABC.
Since taking over as chief executive almost a year ago, Mr. Iger has cast himself as a hands-off manager who will let his executive team members run their business. And “Path to 9/11” was well on its way by the time he took over, having been initiated by Stephen McPherson, the president of ABC Entertainment, and gained the approval of Anne Sweeney, the president of the Disney-ABC Television Group. 
But shortly before Labor Day weekend, Mr. Iger received an angry letter about the accuracy of the program from representatives of Bill Clinton. Mr. Iger stepped into the controversy, reviewing the mini-series and ordering changes in advertisements that had marketed the show as “based on” the 9/11 Commission’s factual report, according to people close to the executive. 
The new ads, which began running after Labor Day, portrayed the mini-series as a docudrama based on several sources. ABC also began reviewing the editing of the film, a process that led it to delete some controversial scenes.
Previously the network portrayed the film as in its finished version, so much so that Thomas H. Kean, a former governor of New Jersey and the chairman of the 9/11 commission, told television critics in July that he was “very happy” with it. The network mailed copies to television critics in mid-August. It screened the first half of the film for audiences in Washington and elsewhere, and distributed thousands of copies to journalists, editorial writers, radio and television commentators and others. 
But once the criticism started and ABC executives decided that some changes would have to be made, the network changed course. After Labor Day and Mr. Iger’s intervention, it said that “no one has seen the final version of the film, because the editing process is not yet complete,” and therefore any complaints about the film’s content were “premature and irresponsible.”
Also after Labor Day, Scholastic decided that it did not want to present a factual study guide to accompany a partly fictionalized drama. It withdrew the study guide, already prepared, “because it didn’t focus enough on the difference between documentary and docudrama,” said Kyle Good, a spokeswoman for Scholastic. She said that the company canceled its contract with ABC and that no money changed hands. 
With millions spent on production, including two months of filming in Morocco and the building of more than 300 sets, ABC had little choice but to go forward with the broadcast. 
In doing so, it likened “Path to 9/11” to other dramas that ran with little or no commercial support — “An Early Frost,” an NBC broadcast in 1985 about AIDS, and “The Day After,” an ABC drama in 1983 about the aftermath of a nuclear attack on the United States.
But the economic scale of those efforts was far smaller. An NBC executive estimated at the time that “An Early Frost” lost $500,000 in commercial revenue as advertisers stayed away — barely a fraction of the cost of “Path to 9/11.” 
One person close to the project at ABC who spoke only on the condition of anonymity said the network believed that its 9/11 presentation fulfilled its purpose, and that compromises were necessary to squeeze more than eight years of history into five hours of television.
Mr. Thompson asserted that however that form of entertainment was categorized, it did little teaching about history. “ ‘Richard III’ is one of the greatest plays ever written,” he said, “but it is not very good history.”

Bethpage
SITTING at a table overlooking Bethpage State Park’s vaunted Black Course, Steve Carl, a small man with shoulders permanently frozen in an Ed Sullivan hunch, is not too shy to disclose that he spent $10 million out of his very own pocket to renovate the dilapidated clubhouse that was the pride and joy of Robert Moses when it opened in 1935. Now it is Mr. Carl’s pride and joy. Even if New York State owns the whole spread.
“Public-private partnerships are where it’s at,” he said.
Mr. Carl confesses to being no golfer but considers himself one heck of a caterer. His Carlyle on the Green (yep, his surname brands the product), which operates out of the majestically restored clubhouse at Bethpage, is booked solid on weekends through 2008. 
This East Meadow lad has come a long way since breaking into the event business 14 years ago as Carlyle Kosher Caterers. Now, after winning the bid to work his magic at another Robert Moses gem, Jones Beach, he is expanding in a big way. Too big, in fact, for him to pull off solo. To build a $40 million catering and restaurant establishment in the footprint of the historic and, alas, defunct Boardwalk Restaurant, Mr. Carl needed a partner.
Who to turn to? Call it kismet that his all-time hero, Donald J. Trump, partook of Carlyle on the Green’s amenities in May of last year while accepting an award for being a generous friend to the state’s parks. Mr. Carl mentioned his Jones Beach deal. Mr. Trump revealed that he, too, had fond memories of wading in the surf and prowling the boardwalk there as a kid. So it was a done deal.
 Well, not quite. “He checked me out a hundred ways from Sunday,” Mr. Carl said. Mr. Trump is into details.
Mr. Carl is positively delighted to take responsibility — or the heat, depending on one’s opinion of Mr. Trump’s impact on landscapes — for the Trumpification of Long Island. The new place, a three-story extravaganza with forever views (maybe) of the pristine ocean, will be called Trump on the Ocean and is expected to be operational in time to give the fathers of summertime brides in 2008 a real bang for their buck. 
It represents Mr. Trump’s first venture on Long Island, and with him aboard, mahogany, marble and gold-plating are a given. “There is nothing like it anywhere ,” Mr. Trump said, weighing in by telephone. “It is unprecedented.”
 The location, he added, was too rare to pass up. “There is no such thing as a building with 25-foot windows hovering over the ocean,” he said. “And this is good for Long Island. What was there was in terrible disrepair. It was crummy.” 
As for the costs, estimated at $40 million to build a showplace that belongs to the state, $200,000 annually to the state for the duration of the 40-year lease, as well as a percentage of the profits to the state, “It was a big job for Steve, but it’s not a big job for me,” Mr. Trump said. 
And as for critics who complain that Mr. Trump and Mr. Carl should pay property taxes on a facility they will build from scratch but not own, rules are rules. Concessionaires on state property are exempt from property taxes. 
 Mr. Trump vehemently opposes, and is crusading against, a wind farm of 40 turbines that has been proposed for about three and a half miles offshore. “Even environmentalists are divided: Some like it, some are repulsed, and the ones who are repulsed are right,” he said. “I’m not a big believer in ruining landscapes.” Or in having the views from Trump on the Ocean sullied. 
Not to belabor the obvious, but naming the place Carl on the Ocean was never an option.
Mr. Carl takes the credit. “I told him, ‘I’ve got it, I’ve got the name: Trump on the Ocean.’ And he said, ‘I like it.’ I realize his name has much more clout than mine. I’m very content letting Donald handle the spotlight. It is my pleasure to put his name on Jones Beach. Ten years ago when I was asked who I would most like to emulate, I said Donald Trump, and today I’m his business partner.” Awesome.
The emulation is not confined to business. Mr. Carl, just emerging from his second divorce, notes that Mr. Trump is sailing along on his third marriage: “I haven’t caught up to him yet.” It does not, however, include hair. Mr. Carl’s is mousy brown and generically combed. “I’m not trying to duplicate the hair,” Mr. Carl said, “but I like his style in deals.”
Bernadette Castro, the state parks commissioner, champions the partnership to the point of hyperventilation. “Jones Beach is not your normal beach,” she said. “Donald Trump fits right in. He only knows one way to do something, and that’s five-star, because his name is everything to him, it’s his marketing tool. Jones Beach is Robert Moses’ greatest legacy, and he would embrace the arrival of Donald Trump.” Don’t forget Mr. Carl. 
 The inaugural Warren Buffett Cup, which ended in Ireland on Thursday, was a great success and close until the United States ran away from Europe over the last three rounds.
 In bridge’s answer to the Ryder Cup in golf, Europe and the United States each sent six pairs. After the pair and team events, Europe enjoyed a 9-point lead. And after 7 of the 11 individual rounds, that margin had been maintained. But the United States won all 6 matches in Rounds 8 and 9 to build a 15-point advantage. In the penultimate round the United States, by gaining another 4 points, put the match away, since there were only 12 points available in the last round. In that final session the United States scored a further 4 points to win by 23.
 The members of the winning team were Jill Levin, Jill Meyers, David Berkowitz, Larry Cohen, Fred Gitelman, Bob Hamman, Geoff Hampson, Bobby Levin, Zia Mahmood, Paul Soloway, Steve Weinstein and Roy Welland, with Donna Compton as nonplaying captain.
 The losers were Sabine Auken and Daniela von Arnim from Germany; Norberto Bocchi and Giorgio Duboin from Italy; Jason and Justin Hackett (twins) from England; Tom Hanlon and Hugh McGann from Ireland; Geir Helgemo and Tor Helness from Norway; and Jan Jansma and Louk Verhees from the Netherlands. Paul Hackett was the nonplaying captain, but he had to play on the final day for Verhees, who had learned that his father had fallen ill in Vancouver.
 The diagramed deal, from Round 3 of the team event, featured a brilliant defense by Meyers.
 Levin (West) opened with a weak two diamonds, Jason Hackett (North) and Meyers (East) passed, and Justin Hackett balanced aggressively with two spades. Understandably, North raised to four spades.
 Declarer was destined to lose two spades and one club. If he also conceded a heart trick, he would fail. And a heart opening lead would have made it easy for the defenders. But West selected the diamond ten, declarer covering with the jack from the board and ruffing away East’s ace. South played a heart to the dummy’s ace, then ran the club nine to West’s ace. Back came a heart, won on the board to give this position:



 
 NORTH 6 5 3 2 2 K 8 7 4 
 


 WEST K   Q 9 6 5 3 2 8 7

 EAST A J 4 Q 10   Q 5 4 3


 
 SOUTH Q 10 9 8 J 6   K J 10
 



 When South called for the diamond king, how should East have defended?
 If East had ruffed low, declarer would have overruffed, discarded dummy’s heart loser on the club king and crossruffed home. But Meyers saw what was required. She trumped with her spade ace and cashed the heart queen. Later West scored her spade king to defeat the contract.

To build a $40 million catering and restaurant establishment in the footprint of the historic and, alas, defunct Boardwalk Restaurant, Mr. Carl needed a partner.
Who to turn to? Call it kismet that his all-time hero, Donald J. Trump, partook of Carlyle on the Green's amenities in May of last year while accepting an award for being a generous friend to the state's parks. Mr. Carl mentioned his Jones Beach deal. Mr. Trump revealed that he, too, had fond memories of wading in the surf and prowling the boardwalk there as a kid. So it was a done deal.
Well, not quite. "He checked me out a hundred ways from Sunday," Mr. Carl said. Mr. Trump is into details.
Mr. Carl is positively delighted to take responsibility -- or the heat, depending on one's opinion of Mr. Trump's impact on landscapes -- for the Trumpification of Long Island. The new place, a three-story extravaganza with forever views (maybe) of the pristine ocean, will be called Trump on the Ocean and is expected to be operational in time to give the fathers of summertime brides in 2008 a real bang for their buck.
It represents Mr. Trump's first venture on Long Island, and with him aboard, mahogany, marble and gold-plating are a given. "There is nothing like it anywhere ," Mr. Trump said, weighing in by telephone. "It is unprecedented."
The location, he added, was too rare to pass up. "There is no such thing as a building with 25-foot windows hovering over the ocean," he said. "And this is good for Long Island. What was there was in terrible disrepair. It was crummy."
As for the costs, estimated at $40 million to build a showplace that belongs to the state, $200,000 annually to the state for the duration of the 40-year lease, as well as a percentage of the profits to the state, "It was a big job for Steve, but it's not a big job for me," Mr. Trump said.
And as for critics who complain that Mr. Trump and Mr. Carl should pay property taxes on a facility they will build from scratch but not own, rules are rules. Concessionaires on state property are exempt from property taxes.
Mr. Trump vehemently opposes, and is crusading against, a wind farm of 40 turbines that has been proposed for about three and a half miles offshore. "Even environmentalists are divided: Some like it, some are repulsed, and the ones who are repulsed are right," he said. "I'm not a big believer in ruining landscapes." Or in having the views from Trump on the Ocean sullied.
Not to belabor the obvious, but naming the place Carl on the Ocean was never an option.
Mr. Carl takes the credit. "I told him, 'I've got it, I've got the name: Trump on the Ocean.' And he said, 'I like it.' I realize his name has much more clout than mine. I'm very content letting Donald handle the spotlight. It is my pleasure to put his name on Jones Beach. Ten years ago when I was asked who I would most like to emulate, I said Donald Trump, and today I'm his business partner." Awesome.
The emulation is not confined to business. Mr. Carl, just emerging from his second divorce, notes that Mr. Trump is sailing along on his third marriage: "I haven't caught up to him yet." It does not, however, include hair. Mr. Carl's is mousy brown and generically combed. "I'm not trying to duplicate the hair," Mr. Carl said, "but I like his style in deals."
Bernadette Castro, the state parks commissioner, champions the partnership to the point of hyperventilation. "Jones Beach is not your normal beach," she said. "Donald Trump fits right in. He only knows one way to do something, and that's five-star, because his name is everything to him, it's his marketing tool. Jones Beach is Robert Moses' greatest legacy, and he would embrace the arrival of Donald Trump." Don't forget Mr. Carl.

To the Editor:
Sol Wachtler’s personal account of solitary confinement in a “special housing unit” (“A Cell of One’s Own,” Op-Ed, Sept. 24) graphically describes the sad, neglectful and dangerous handling of our mentally ill offenders in the New York State prison system. It is shameful that Governor Pataki vetoed a bill that would have prevented such treatment.
 There are decades of scientific research that support the need for the implementation and maintenance of integrated systems of mental health care in jails and prisons to prevent suicide as well as to maintain minimum standards of care inherent under constitutional protections. 
 It is also shortsighted and plain wrong for the governor to have said that separate hospital wards would have cost too much. Suicide costs millions in lawsuits and produces an awesome impact on both inmates and staff (correction officers themselves are at high risk for suicide) within a correctional institution.
 This is why police officers, correction officers and mental health advocates all support policies to provide adequate financing for facilities that provide at least minimum standards of care for the mentally ill within our prison system.

Broadwater’s Plan: Be Very Afraid
To the Editor:
Your Sept. 24 editorial “The Coast Guard on Broadwater” says the Coast Guard’s report considers Broadwater Energy’s planned floating natural gas depot in Long Island Sound “an entirely manageable risk.” In fact, the report concludes there are substantial risks associated with this gigantic facility. 
The report specifies a myriad of necessary critical safety controls. The Coast Guard would need additional staff and marine vessels. A security zone of 1.5 square miles surrounding the terminal with constant patrols would be established. L.N.G. tankers would require a security zone of two nautical miles in front, one nautical mile in back and 750 yards on each side and an armed escort. 
A flammable vapor cloud could travel 4.3 miles from a tanker during a severe accident. Such a vapor cloud could affect Fishers Island, Plum Island or the North Fork of Long Island. The report concludes that existing marine firefighting capability is currently inadequate. Taxpayers will be required to help pay for the security measures, and you can bet it’s not going to be cheap. 
The Times may not think this is “scary,” but we do!

Re “On the Ocean, a Trump Deal,” by Robin Finn (The Island column, Sept. 24):
Despite Steve Carl’s near worship of Donald Trump, the glitz of a three-story building called Trump on the Ocean is not in keeping with the vision Robert Moses had when he proposed the creation of Jones Beach. 
Moses’ idea was to provide a respite for cityfolk to relax and enjoy nature without formality or glitter. Note that Moses did not propose his idea be called Moses on the Ocean.
Bernadette Castro, the state parks commissioner, is remiss in having held only one poorly attended public hearing about this controversial project in a New York State public facility.

Re “Look Back Across Time, and See Moses Spinning,” by Peter Applebome (Our Towns column, Sept. 27), about the impact of Robert Moses  and now Donald Trump  on Jones Beach State Park:
Robert Moses understood exactly that glamour and entertainment drew patrons to the renowned beach. We continue that tradition with concerts, firework spectaculars and air shows that draw millions of visitors. 
An oceanfront restaurant, with indoor and outdoor dining and catering facilities, has always existed on the boardwalk, playing a valuable role in enhancing the visitor experience.
The design, materials and vision for the proposed new restaurant reflect both the historic character and the high profile of Jones Beach. We are confident that Mr. Trump’s investment and involvement with Trump on the Ocean will appeal to our longstanding patrons and entice first-time visitors as well. 
This $30 million to $40 million project is indeed consistent with Moses’ vision for attracting patrons, and we are pleased to be able to one-up the master builder himself by having the private sector, not the public sector, pick up the tab.

The Festival of New Trumpet Music does precisely what its name prescribes. Since being founded by the trumpeter Dave Douglas in 2003, it has reveled in newness and yes, trumpets, in rich profusion. And with each new season, it has become more of a festival, spreading out over the map as well as the calendar: this year’s iteration will involve a total of nine spaces by the time it concludes on Oct. 15 with a benefit for music programs in New York City public schools. 
That civic gesture is one indication of this festival’s steady maturation; another would be its nonprofit status, and the concomitant support of several sources of arts funds. They helped underwrite a series of five commissions, which will have their premieres over three nights at Makor. Tuesday was the first installment, with sets by the trumpeters Cuong Vu and Peter Evans.
“The word ‘commission’ is kind of serious,” Mr. Vu said half-jokingly as he introduced his two untitled new compositions, confessing to some nervousness. If he was actually concerned, he needn’t have been: the music was smartly conceived and well executed by his trio. 
In the first piece Mr. Vu and the electric bassist Stomu Takeishi played lines that were carefully entwined. The second found Mr. Takeishi and the drummer Ted Poor antagonistically thrashing as if they were in a metal band. 
Mr. Vu soloed clear-headedly over that combustible churn, with streams of evenly clipped eighth notes and the occasional triplet flurry. This is the brand of soaring confidence that he routinely displays in the Pat Metheny Group, a fact probably not lost on the audience, which included Mr. Metheny. 
In the strongest parts of Mr. Vu’s set he seemed to be playing his trumpet from within the stir rather than above it. On “It’s Mostly Residual,” Mr. Vu and Mr. Takeishi deftly used samplers and processors to construct a layered atmosphere. The sensory effect was enveloping and hypnotic, like standing on the deck of a ship and watching a storm roll in. 
“Expressions of a Neurotic Impulse” took the opposite tack but felt similarly immersive. Mr. Vu began with a melodic tic, not unlike a car alarm, before Mr. Takeishi took an extraordinary open-form solo complete with electronic loops. Mr. Poor matched that protean intensity, while Mr. Vu provided contrast with angelic long tones. Mr. Vu was being stealthily subversive: with one hand he manipulated a sampled chorus of trumpet-generated whooshes, screeches and slurs.
Those sounds, among others, were integral to an earlier set in which Mr. Evans, a serious technician, gave the impression of laboring to avoid producing any sound that could qualify as a note. His quartet, featuring Brandon Seabrook on guitar and banjo, kept up an emphatic din that would have been more likeable with just a hint of a smile. 
PARIS — As international authorities strive to harmonize a myriad of rules for carry-on flight luggage, a Russian-American jazz musician is nursing a broken arm he said he suffered in a struggle with French airport police over his right to board with a prized trumpet.
 The musician, Valery Ponomarev, 63, a former member of Art Blakey’s Jazz Messengers, was preparing to board an Air India flight on Sept. 9 from Paris to New York City, where he lives, when a routine airport ritual erupted into a fierce dispute over his 1961 Connstellation trumpet.
 “If you’ve ever played a musical instrument, then you should know how strong the bond is between the musician and the instrument,” Mr. Ponomarev said. “You wouldn’t give your baby away to anybody, and so you wouldn’t give away your horn.”
 In his case, the ties were so powerful that he simply would not let go of his trumpet case, which also contained a fluegelhorn.
 But the authorities were not sympathetic and maintain that the trumpeter was uncooperative with airport and airline officials in a time of heightened security.
According to Mr. Ponomarev, when he arrived late to board an evening flight, a flustered Air India employee retrieved his trumpet from a luggage belt at a security checkpoint without explanation to place it in the plane’s hold.
Mr. Ponomarev protested vigorously, he said, because he had hand-carried the instrument on an earlier connecting flight and also had noticed that another passenger was carrying aboard a sitar. His angry complaints attracted the notice of an Air India supervisor, who summoned the police.
Four officers came running to take his trumpet case, but Mr. Ponomarev refused to give it to them, and one of them subdued him by wrenching his arm behind his back and, according to the musician, breaking it.
 The airport authorities and the police confirm that the episode took place as Mr. Ponomarev was boarding the flight at Charles de Gaulle airport. But in the view of the police, the musician bears responsibility for his injury. 
“The officers tried to subdue him, and you can say that he hurt himself by rebelling,” said a spokesman for the airport police.
 H. Rana, the regional manager for Air India’s Paris office, said airline employees called the police because Mr. Ponomarev insisted on carrying his music case on board. She said that Air India requires the check-in of large instruments.
 In Europe, carry-on luggage rules vary among airlines. Last week, the European Commission moved to standardize the rules with new regulations taking effect next spring that restrict the amount of liquids carried aboard for personal use and limit carry-on luggage size. But there may be exemptions for some cameras and musical instruments.
 The rule change comes too late for Mr. Ponomarev, who said that after his arm was broken he was held in detention without treatment for six hours and was not allowed to make any calls.
Ultimately, he was taken to a hospital where one of the doctors loaned him a cellphone to contact the United States Embassy.
 After surgery, Mr. Ponomarev returned on September 13 to the United States on another Air India flight. With a metal plate holding the bones of his left arm together, Mr. Ponomarev said the break had an immediate effect on his career: He was forced to cancel a musical engagement and limit his daily practice because it is too painful to hold the trumpet with a weakened arm.
 By late September, though, he decided to participate in a long-scheduled jazz concert in Russia, where he was born, although he has lived in the United States since 1973. The announcer, he said, explained to the audience that Mr. Ponomarev was playing despite a struggle with the French police.
 “I think the audience thought that he was joking,” Mr. Ponomarev said, but he still took the microphone to correct the announcer: “They didn’t win the battle. They broke my arm. But the horn is still with me.”

A "CSI: Miami" episode about the seedy underbelly of the modeling world was Monday's most-watched show, putting CBS on top for the night. According to Nielsen's estimates, "CSI: Miami" averaged 17.9 million viewers in the 10 p.m. hour. It easily beat the season premiere of "What About Brian" on ABC (7 million) and the fourth installment of NBC's "Studio 60 on the Sunset Strip" (8.8 million), in which Matt Albie (Matthew Perry) clashed with his old girlfriend, Harriet (Sarah Paulson). "Studio 60" notably increased its audience among adults 18 to 49 by 12 percent, ending its marked ratings slide since its premiere four weeks ago. CBS's comedies in the 8 p.m. hour, which swapped time slots this week, also showed improvement: "How I Met Your Mother" drew 9.7 million viewers at 8 p.m., and "The Class" drew 10 million at 8:30. The other Monday night comedies on CBS, "Two and a Half Men" (17.1 million) and "The New Adventures of Old Christine" (13.7 million), shared the lead in the 9 p.m. hour with NBC's new serial drama, "Heroes" (13.3 million), which was No. 1 among adults 18 to 49. NBC finished second for the night. BENJAMIN TOFF
STAMFORD
THE developers strutting their stuff along the boulevards that crisscross this city’s downtown represent some of the most prominent names in the trade.
Lowe Enterprises, a national development company based in Los Angeles; W&M Properties, a New York real estate management firm affilated with the owner of the Empire State Building; and Donald J. Trump are backing projects that could bring some 1,100 residential units, 325,000 square feet of office space and 140,000 square feet of retailing to the downtown area in the next few years. 
Yet these projects are overshadowed by what Michael Freimuth, the city’s economic development director, calls “the 800-pound gorilla” proposed by a lesser-known entity, Antares Investment Partners.
 Its $3.5 billion plan to revitalize the city’s underused South End over 10 years covers “easily a third of the real estate in that neighborhood,” Mr. Freimuth said, adding that the site’s prime location on a peninsula on Long Island Sound and within walking distance of the city’s transportation center “makes it seem even larger.” 
Called Harbor Point, the mixed-use project is the latest in a series of bold, if not always immediately successful, moves by Antares, a Greenwich-based development and private equity firm. 
“We’re looking for things that are big and are transforming to the markets that we do business with,” said Joseph P. Beninati, the former chief executive of a 615-employee technology firm. Mr. Beninati co-founded Antares in 1996 with a prep school buddy, James P. Cabrera, then a president for the Galbreath Company. Antares was named after one of the brightest stars in the sky, the developers said, describing the name as a symbol of their aggressive corporate philosophy.
Since it began acquiring properties in the tristate area five years ago, Antares has amassed billions of dollars in capital from the likes of Goldman Sachs, Lehman Brothers and, for the South End project, Lubert-Adler Real Estate Funds. The company estimates the value of its real estate portfolio at $4.5 billion, including $171 million in land bought for Harbor Point. 
Spread across 82 acres of former industrial sites, abandoned factories and a boatyard-marina, the project calls for the creation of five distinct neighborhoods set around parks and waterfront promenades. 
New pedestrian walkways and the extension of major access roads from downtown will feed traffic toward the waterfront and the 15.8-acre Kosciusko Park. 
The plan calls for roughly 4,000 residential units interspersed with at least 400,000 square feet of retail outlets, 200,000 square feet of office space, a 60-room “boutique” hotel and a marina. Ten percent of the residences will be reserved for families earning 30 to 80 percent of the Stamford area median family income, currently about $116,300. 
The project, now before Stamford’s Planning Board, has so far generated little opposition, largely because city officials, major employers and residents of the neglected area are eager for its revitalization.
 Some downtown merchants have expressed concern that the project’s stores and restaurants might shift the focus away from the downtown core, but even Sandra Goldstein, the downtown’s main advocate, is careful in her criticism. 
“We love probably 80 percent of the plan,” said Ms. Goldstein, executive director of the Downtown Special Services District.
 “Our concern relates to the intensive destination retail, which will have four or five big-box retailers on the Yale & Towne site,” a factory site now partially occupied by antique and art dealers. Though her organization would like the city to prohibit additional retail development there, Ms. Goldstein emphasizes that “we don’t want to stop this plan.” 
The Harbor Point project comes fast on the heels of Antares’s $223 million acquisition in February of two apartment complexes in Greenwich for conversion to condominiums. The company is also building mansions starting at $10 million on some 50 acres in backcountry Greenwich; a $40 million retail development in Armonk, N.Y.; and a 27-lot private gated community there called CiderMill. 
“We can’t confidently say that we’re the largest and the most active developer in the tristate area,” Mr. Beninati said, “but we’re pretty sure there’s no one doing more than us.”
Some of Antares’s investments have proved spectacularly successful. The holder of a 22 percent equity stake in the Pickwick Plaza office park in Greenwich and manager of the site, Antares will share in the profit of some $120 million from the pending sale of that property, which is under contract for $230 million.
The firm is equally pleased with its 50 percent ownership stake in the Delamar Hotel, also in Greenwich, where showy yachts are commonly moored at the private dock and the average room goes for more than $300 a night. 
But the company’s record on its residential projects is less impressive. More than two years ago, Mr. Beninati said that at least 130 people were on a waiting list for 27 town homes and single-family homes at the CiderMill development in Armonk. To date, however, only 11 have sold, at prices of $1.1 million to $2.7 million. 
“Our sales have not gone as fast as we like because the product is more of a Ferrari than a Lexus,” Mr. Beninati said. “There’s obviously a smaller market for that.” 
Sales are also slow at the two Greenwich complexes being converted to condominiums: Greenwich Oaks and Greenwich Place.
 Tenants renting at the multibuilding complexes were offered “insider” incentives to buy their units, priced at an average $1 million, with reductions that the developers say exceed $100,000 in some cases. Yet, Mr. Beninati said, fewer than 10 tenants have signed contracts to buy any of the 462 units. He ascribes the lack of interest to a hesitancy among longtime renters to buy and dismisses suggestions that Antares misread the market. 
“It’s a complicated conversion process that has made for some confusion on just how they can become owners there at reasonable prices,” he said. 
About 260 tenants are still renting at the complexes, which are being converted building by building. Antares at first contracted with Greenwich Fine Properties to handle sales there but has now decided to use an in-house team, and recently began advertising the condominiums in earnest to outside buyers. The starting price for a one-bedroom is less than $500,000, down from the previous estimate of $600,000. 
Now, as it gears up for the Harbor Point undertaking, Antares is thinking bigger than ever. In the future, projects like Armonk Square — a villagelike retailing and housing plan totaling 54,000 square feet — may be deemed too small for the company. After all, boasted Mr. Beninati, the Harbor Point project will probably be “the largest commercial job creator in the history of the state of Connecticut.” 
For the trumpeter Tomasz Stanko, one of the most acclaimed improvising musicians in Europe, the significance of jazz was unmistakable the first time he heard it more than 50 years ago.
"The message was freedom," he said one afternoon last week in a Midtown Manhattan hotel room. "For me, as a Polish who was living in Communist country," he continued in his slightly broken English, "jazz was synonym of Western culture, of freedom, of this different style of life."
Speaking in a rapid-fire cadence, checkered-framed glasses accenting his oval face, the 64-year-old Mr. Stanko resembled a weathered but ageless hipster, which in some ways he is. As a young blood, he led one of the first European bands inspired by the free jazz of Ornette Coleman. His solo career was essentially an underground affair until about a decade ago, when a new batch of exquisitely lyrical albums for the German label ECM sparked a surge in recognition at home in Europe and in the United States.
Mr. Stanko, who lives in Warsaw, was in New York between stops on a 12-city tour, his fourth cross-country American trek in five years. (Its last leg starts tonight at Birdland.) He was expected shortly at a reception organized by the Polish Consulate, across from his hotel; he would play solo, then with classical musicians on a chamber composition.
"He is one of the greatest figures of Polish culture," the consul general, Krzysztof W. Kasprzyk, would later proclaim, adding that he had first heard Mr. Stanko as a student in Krakow in the 1960's.
Like most Eastern Europeans of his generation, Mr. Stanko encountered jazz through Voice of America broadcasts and State Department tours; the music registered as a soundtrack of freedom partly because it was packaged that way by the United States government. Mr. Stanko recalled seeing Dave Brubeck in a 1958 tour.
In a 1958 interview in Down Beat magazine cited by the historian Penny M. Von Eschen in her book "Satchmo Blows Up the World: Jazz Ambassadors Play the Cold War" (Harvard University Press), Mr. Brubeck described that tour: "Whenever there was a dictatorship in Europe, jazz was outlawed," he said. "And whenever freedom returned to those countries, the playing of jazz inevitably accompanied it." In Poland, he added, the word freedom "was in the mouths of everybody we had anything to do with."
Mr. Stanko said he still remembered that sort of yearning, which could be said to exist, on a subconscious level, even on "Lontano," his latest album. It is his third consecutive release featuring the pianist Marcin Wasilewski, the bassist Slawomir Kurkiewicz and the drummer Michal Miskiewicz, who were working as a trio when Mr. Stanko discovered them as teenagers in the early 1990's. (Last year they released an album of their own, called "Trio," that underscored their deep rapport.)
Like the two albums before it, "Lontano" is a haunting, suitelike effort, with Mr. Stanko's trumpet as the running thread. But it is more restless than its predecessors; often it assumes an avant-garde elasticity evocative of Mr. Stanko's earlier, freedom-seeking recordings. For this he credits the creative tension provided by his producer, Manfred Eicher, the founder of ECM, along with the imagination of Mr. Wasilewski and his colleagues, who learned the art of free improvisation on the job.
"It's true that I come back to the past, to improvised music," Mr. Stanko said. "But exactly my mood. This is what I really love in music, you know, this kind of narration, like maybe what in literature Faulkner has." As if to illustrate the point, he made an indeterminate gesture: shoulders scrunched, palms upturned, head tilted to the side. "Also a similar mood all the time, like in this early Antonioni movie." (He was referring to "Il Grido," from 1957.)
Mr. Stanko was feeling allusive, recalling some of the art that inspired him around the same time that he first voraciously consumed the music of Mr. Coleman, John Coltrane and Miles Davis. Recalling the atmosphere rather than the plot of that Antonioni film, Mr. Stanko said, "It was always raining all the time, and I remember this extremely great melancholy mood."
He found a similar feeling elsewhere in Italian Neo-Realist cinema, which he studied -- in addition to other contemporaneous films, and paintings by Modigliani -- for their play of light and form. And during much of the 1960's he worked closely with a Polish composer and pianist of equal cinematic interests: Krzysztof Komeda, who had already begun scoring Roman Polanski's movies. Ten years ago Mr. Stanko recorded an album of themes by Mr. Komeda, who died in 1969.
"Kattorna," the only nonoriginal piece on "Lontano," is a song Mr. Stanko used to play in Mr. Komeda's band; it's the jauntiest track on the album and has served as a set closer for Mr. Stanko's quartet on its current tour. The musicians played it during their late show at the Regattabar, a jazz club in Cambridge, Mass., a couple of nights after the Polish Consulate reception.
"We play this music different live," Mr. Stanko had said in New York, and the Regattabar set illustrated his point, conveying an energy more emphatic but less experimental than on "Lontano." On the title track, originally a collective improvisation, the band adopted an aggressive tone: Mr. Stanko's solo was bright and rhythmically forward, and Mr. Wasilewski, whose abstractions on the album can suggest Herbie Hancock or Keith Jarrett, opted more for the crashing modal fury of McCoy Tyner.
What felt unaltered was the catalytic chemistry of the group, most evident in a stretch of medium-tempo swing on one ballad and a sudden double-time figure on another. Mr. Kurkiewicz and Mr. Miskiewicz locked into each tempo with what seemed like effortless intuition, and Mr. Wasilewski fashioned a series of boldly cresting improvisations.
The other constant was Mr. Stanko's trumpet voice, a brooding but self-assured timbre occasionally suggestive of Miles Davis, but with its own subtleties of tone and control. Its qualities brought to mind a statement Mr. Stanko had made in his hotel room, after affirming his debt to American jazz and his liberation from it.
"This is my way to follow roots: to get ideas, not sound," he said. "To get ideas," he reiterated, "but in my way. In my language."

Nearly a dozen of the contested House races are taking place along the valley of the Ohio River, a manufacturing region that is struggling. The economy and job losses are among the top issues on voters' minds. Factor in the discontent with the Iraq war, and the region's Republican incumbents are campaigning with not one but two weights shackled to their ankles.
But there's also an anti-incumbent mood in Congressional districts where the economy is in full flower. Democrats are in close races in prosperous Republican suburbs, like the one represented by J.D. HAYWORTH in Scottsdale, Ariz.; retiring Representative HENRY HYDE's district near Chicago; Representative DAVE REICHERT's district outside Seattle; Representative CHRISTOPHER SHAYS's district in the Connecticut suburbs of New York; and Representative CLAY SHAW's on Florida's gold coast.
The results of these elections could show whether concerns about Iraq or other matters override an axiom of politics: prosperity is hard to beat. DAVID D. KIRKPATRICK
WASHINGTON, Nov. 5 - President Bush on Sunday seized on the conviction of Saddam Hussein as a milestone in Iraq, seeking to rally Republican voters with the issue of national security as some polls suggested that his party might be making gains in the final hours of the campaign.
The White House said the timing of the announcement, two days before Election Day, had nothing to do with American politics and had been dictated by the Iraqi court. But Mr. Bush moved quickly to put it to use in what has been his central strategic imperative over the past week, trying to rouse Republican voters to turn out.
"Today we witnessed a landmark event in the history of Iraq: Saddam Hussein was convicted and sentenced to death by the Iraqi High Tribunal," Mr. Bush said to roars of approval in a hockey auditorium packed with supporters in Grand Island, Neb. "Saddam Hussein's trial is a milestone in the Iraqi people's efforts to replace the rule of a tyrant with the rule of law."
The announcement out of Baghdad came as polls suggested some gains for Republicans. A Pew Research Center Survey released on Sunday found that the number of likely voters who said they would vote for the Democrats was now 47 percent compared with 43 percent who said they would vote for Republicans. Two weeks ago, Democrats had an edge of 50 to 39. A Washington Post-ABC News poll found a similar tightening.
These kinds of polls, about the so-called generic ballot, measure national trends and do not necessarily provide an accurate measure of what is happening in individual House and Senate races. Andrew Kohut, the president of the Pew Center, said the poll nonetheless found that Republicans were becoming more enthusiastic as Election Day approached, a sign that the party was making progress in addressing one of its main problems this year: a dispirited base.
With at least 20 House races and 3 Senate races virtually tied in polls over the past week, Republican officials have looked to the huge voter turnout operation the party has developed over the past six years as its last-stand defense to prevent Democrats from making big gains on Tuesday.
A series of Mason-Dixon polls published on Sunday suggested a tightening in two Senate races, Rhode Island and Maryland, that Democrats had been confident of winning.
Republicans over the past week have spent heavily in Maryland on behalf of Michael Steele, the Republican candidate seeking to fill the seat being vacated by Senator Paul S. Sarbanes, a Democrat. In Rhode Island, Senator Lincoln Chafee, the Republican, has spent heavily and banked on his family's long history in the state's politics to help him survive in a heavily Democratic state.
Ken Mehlman, the Republican chairman, said polls showed that Republicans and conservatives "were coming home," which he said "is what happens when voters focus on the choice before them."
Representative Rahm Emanuel of Illinois, the Democrat leading his party's effort to win control of the House, said, "It's inevitable that there would be some tightening in the end."
Still, Mr. Emanuel, who has been careful this campaign to avoid the public expressions of optimism voiced by other Democrats, added, "This is making me nervous."
Across the country, Democrats also hailed the verdict in Baghdad but argued that it would make no difference in delivering stability to Iraq and would have little bearing on Tuesday's vote.
"I think it's a great verdict -- I mean, Saddam Hussein is a war criminal and he's getting what he deserves," Howard Dean, the Democratic national chairman, said on "This Week" on ABC. "But I don't think it has any impact on the safety of America."
Representative John P. Murtha, the Pennsylvania Democrat who has become the face of his party's opposition to the war in Iraq, said the verdict was the right one but predicted it would not make a difference in this campaign. What would matter more, Mr. Murtha said, were editorials in military papers being published Monday calling for the resignation of Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld.
"When The Army Times, The Navy Times, The Marine Corps Times, they have all said that we're not supporting the troops, that they're losing confidence with the administration, that's what's important," Mr. Murtha said, campaigning in Croydon, Pa., outside Philadelphia, for Patrick Murphy, a Democrat seeking to unseat Representative Michael G. Fitzpatrick.
The fact that Mr. Bush was spending this last Sunday before Election Day in two of the most Republican states in the nation was testimony to how bleak a year this has been for the Republican Party and the president. And in Florida, the home state of his brother, Mr. Bush received what appeared to be another reminder of his political unpopularity when Charlie Crist, the Republican candidate for governor, backed out of a planned appearance with Mr. Bush in Pensacola on Monday.
Mr. Crist said that he needed to spend the day in more competitive parts of the state and that he was not joining the list of other Republican candidates who had snubbed Mr. Bush this year.
The White House, however, said this week that the president was heading to Florida specifically to help Mr. Crist, who, according to Tony Fratto, a White House spokesman, invited Mr. Bush in the first place.
But an official with Mr. Crist's campaign, who would not talk for attribution, said that Mr. Crist had never confirmed the appearance.
On the final Sunday of the election cycle, the leaders of the four Congressional campaign committees took their seats around the table of "Meet the Press" on NBC, appearing together for the first time in the midterm contest -- and promptly diving into a sharp exchange over the war in Iraq.
"To pull out, to withdraw from this war, is losing, there's no question about it," said Senator Elizabeth Dole of North Carolina, the chairwoman of the National Republican Senatorial Committee. "The Democrats appear to be content with losing."
Mr. Emanuel, chairman of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, turned sharply toward Mrs. Dole, his face lined with outrage.
"You should take that back, Senator," he said. But Mrs. Dole kept speaking over him, creating a minute of partisan cacophony on the television set.
"I will not sit idly by with an accusation that Democrats are content with losing," Mr. Emanuel said.
Mr. Bush was unambiguous in hailing the conviction of Mr. Hussein as welcome news from a country where good reports have been in short supply this election season. That said, there have frequently been developments in Iraq over the past two years that Mr. Bush has proclaimed as turning points, only to see them followed by renewed violence and further deterioration.
And while these announcements of Iraqi milestones have at times produced a lift for Mr. Bush in the polls, the gains have tended to be fleeting.
Still, just before an election that is this close, Republicans suggested that the events of Sunday could be politically helpful.
A senior Republican Party official, who insisted on anonymity to speak about the political implications of the announcement, said it would invigorate Republican voters distressed about Iraq but would not have much effect beyond that. And Senator Charles E. Schumer of New York, who is heading the Democratic effort to win back the Senate, said, "People are worried about thefuture of Iraq, not the past."
Senior aides to Mr. Bush scoffed at suggestions that the announcement of the verdict had somehow been orchestrated by the White House.
"Are you smoking rope?" Tony Snow, the White House spokesman, said Saturday in anticipation of the verdict. "Are you telling me that in Iraq, that they're sitting around -- I'm sorry, that the Iraqi judicial system is coming up with an October surprise?"
White House officials were clearly prepared for the news, posing Mr. Bush before Air Force One to make a celebratory announcement as he left Waco, Tex., and inserting remarks about it into his speeches. On Sunday morning, Mr. Snow made a round of the talk shows to praise the development, echoed throughout the day by Republican surrogates and candidates.
Representative J. D. Hayworth, a Republican in a close race in Arizona's Fifth Congressional District, used a previously scheduled early morning appearance on the Fox News Channel show "Fox and Friends" to declare the Hussein sentence "a victory for the Iraqi people." Mr. Hayworth said it offered Americans heading to the polls "a chance to take stock" of the war's dividends.
From California to Missouri to Connecticut, candidates put up their final advertisements.
In Pennsylvania, Karen Santorum, Senator Rick Santorum's wife, speaks directly into the camera in a 60-second advertisement, looking almost mournful as she says that she has found attacks on her family for living in Virginia hurtful, explaining that they moved there to be closer to Mr. Santorum when he is working.

LEXINGTON, Ky., Nov. 8 (AP) — Most college basketball towns would be more than content with a 22-13 record, a trip to the conference semifinals and a 4-point loss at the hands of a national power in the second round of the N.C.A.A. tournament.
This is not most college basketball towns. This is the home of one of the most successful programs in history. And for Kentucky fans, last season just was not good enough.
It is a sentiment shared by Coach Tubby Smith, entering his 10th season in Lexington. His tenure began with a national championship but has not produced another Final Four appearance since — the longest such drought for the storied program.
“I’ll just say it was bad,” Smith said of 2005-6, which resulted in a 9-7 record in the Southeastern Conference — the Wildcats’ worst in 16 years — and an 87-83 loss to top-seeded Connecticut in the N.C.A.A. tournament.
The sophomore Rajon Rondo, the lightning-quick guard who led the Wildcats last season in points, rebounds, assists and steals, left early for the N.B.A. The senior Patrick Sparks, who had a down year but at times still showed a lethal touch from long range, also is gone.
So with last season’s sag and the backcourt departures, Kentucky enters the season no longer as the titans of the SEC but perhaps lacking the element of surprise enjoyed by a typical underdog. During the conference’s media days last month, opposing coaches cautioned that teams should not take Kentucky lightly.
“We are definitely improved,” said Lukasz Obrzut, a 7-foot-1 senior center from Poland. “A new word for me, cohesiveness. We are coming together as a team and working on our communication skills.”
No Wildcat was selected to the SEC’s preseason first team, and only center Randolph Morris made the second team. Rather than rely on one star to carry the load, the Wildcats will seek chemistry through a variety of spare parts, each of whom showed flashes of stardom a year ago.
Morris, a junior center, was suspended for the first half of last season after he tried unsuccessfully to be drafted by an N.B.A. team. It took him awhile to get his bearings and re-emerge as an inside force down the stretch, but he still managed to average 13 points and 6 rebounds a game.
Obrzut and Jared Carter, a sophomore, provide depth at center. Should Smith opt for a larger lineup, Morris can play power forward.
Rondo was the headliner of a trio of guards that came to Kentucky before the 2004-5 season. The others appear ready to contribute.
When Ramel Bradley is hitting his shots, few players look better from 3-point range. When he’s not, few players look worse. He’ll take over the point guard duties and already has emerged as the team’s most vocal leader.
“I’ve matured a lot this year,” Bradley said. “I’ve just got to key on what coach wants me to do, not push the ball but find the open teammates.”
Injuries and Morris’ suspension forced his fellow junior Joe Crawford into a forward role for much of last season. This season, he should settle into his more natural position as a shooting guard. Although he had an undisclosed off-season operation that he feared might threaten his ability to play, Crawford said he never felt better and was ready to lead.
“There were games when I was up, games when I was down,” Crawford said. “This year, I’m going to make it a point to be consistent.”
Bobby Perry gave the Wildcats a little of everything — even the occasional 3-pointer — and was particularly good during the two N.C.A.A. tournament games, averaging more than 22 points. He is capable of playing small forward when Smith goes with a bigger lineup featuring Morris and Obrzut.
Smith acknowledged last season was tough. He pulled key players from the starting lineup down the stretch — including Rondo — and replaced them with a smaller, less-flashy five that got higher grades in practice drills.
The bad news this season is he might not have the depth to do something like that. The good news is that the starting roles appear more set now than they were at any point last season.
“Any time you don’t have to deal with uncertainty, it is a good thing,” Smith said.
It was shown in 2000 by Dr. Marian Cleeves Diamond of the University of California, Berkeley, that playing bridge helps the immune system. By taking blood from 12 women in their 70s and 80s before and after a 90-minute duplicate session, Dr. Diamond found that their CD-4-positive T-cell count had risen significantly.
Now we can add excellent therapy to the medical benefits of bridge.
Recently Richie Schwartz of New York spent 13 days in a hospital. On the ninth he begged his doctor for a one-day pass to go play in the big-money game at the Cavendish Bridge Club. The diagramed deal occurred during this session.
Schwartz (South), despite having a lot of playing tricks, rebid one spade, not two spades, because he had only 15 high-card points and his heart void was a potential negative. Then, when North continued with a game-invitational three hearts, Schwartz paused. His hand had clear slam potential, but that void had just gotten worse. Eventually he chose three no-trump as the final contract.
East, who thought he had a nasty surprise for declarer, and perhaps being influenced by South's apparent uncertainty, doubled, asking for a heart lead. Schwartz happily redoubled. (You may draw inferences from an opponent's hesitation, but you do so at your own risk. You may not draw any inferences from the tempo of your partner's bidding and play.)
Against three no-trump redoubled, West led the heart ace and continued with his second heart, declarer winning with the king on the board and discarding two spades from his hand. South could have taken the diamond finesse now, but he wanted stronger medicine. Declarer cashed dummy's spade ace, then ran the club suit to give this end position:
On the last club East discarded his spade ten. South exited with his spade queen and put in the queen on East's diamond return to collect two overtricks.
As Schwartz said, plus 1,800 was wonderful medicine.

NEW YORK — On Tuesday, just two days after their first wedding anniversary, a couple in their 20s invited a small group of friends and relatives to their two-bedroom condominium on the Upper West Side.
After clinking glasses, they made an announcement that caught the husband's male friends off guard but surprised few of the wife's female friends. Yes, they were expecting, in the spring, their first.
That was Donald John Trump Jr. and Vanessa Trump doing things the normal way.
The next night, Donald Trump Jr., dressed in a pinstripe suit, stood before the cameras in a crowd of models and second-generation New York social personalities at a cocktail party at a Manhattan art gallery to celebrate his wife's appearance on the cover of Hamptons magazine.
As he forecast the joys and challenges of fatherhood, reporters attempted to calibrate, by the size of the bump beneath the belly of Vanessa Trump's teal Issa London gown, how long the world would have to wait for a new playmate for Barron, the 8-month-old son of Melania and Donald Trump Sr.
That was Donald Trump Jr. and Vanessa Trump doing things the Trump way.
After 28 years hidden in the glare of his high-wattage father, the junior Donald Trump, it appears, is finally ready to live up to the famous name that is both a banner and a target. With a rising profile within the family business, a model wife who is building the couple's presence on the New York social circuit, a major new role in the upcoming season of "The Apprentice" reality television series and, yes, a new Trump heir on the way, Donald Trump Jr. is finally one half of a boldface couple, a personality. A budding star? Perhaps. But at the very least, a Trump.
This is no small concern in a family business where celebrity, as much as real estate, is the lifeblood. It is celebrity that transforms ordinary vodka into Trump vodka, bottled spring water into Trump Ice, and glassy high- rises into symbols of gilded big-city aspiration.
Until recently, the younger Trump said, he had always avoided publicity, "because otherwise, I'm just Donald Trump's son, some little rich kid running around."
"But when I started working," he said, "I realized that there's an end goal, that I can use some of this. It would be like having an advantage and not taking advantage of it. That's called stupid."
He spoke on a recent afternoon in his cramped office on the 26th floor of Trump Tower, down the hallway from his father. It is 40 stories below the penthouse apartment where he spent much of his childhood with his siblings Ivanka and Eric.
For five years, he has spent some 14 hours a day there as executive vice president for development and acquisitions - the original apprentice, basically.
But until recently, someone could live in Trump World Tower, wear a Donald J. Trump Signature Collection suit, and spritz himself with Donald Trump: The Fragrance cologne without knowing there was a Donald Jr.
An Ivanka, yes. Don Jr.'s pouty-lipped sister, now 25, has been famous since she began modeling in her teens, and she lately has been reported to be dating the actor Topher Grace. She has been working in the family business for a year and a half.
Donald Trump Jr. generally stayed in the shadows, like the youngest of Donald and Ivana Trump's children, Eric, 22, who graduated from Georgetown University in May and began working in the Trump Organization a few months ago. (Donald Sr. also has a daughter by Marla Maples, Tiffany, who is 13.)
"Don is just a down-to-earth person," said Dee Dee Sides, a friend. "I think the thought just never crossed his mind that he was going to have to be more visible because of the nature of the family company."
In fact, their childhoods were oddly normal, Eric Trump recalled. The eldest sibling, he said, held a certain authority over the two younger kids.
"Donnie's always been my best friend, a mentor," Eric Trump said.
"In a way, he raised me. My father, I love and I appreciate, but he always worked 24 hours a day."
Unlike Ivanka and Eric, Don Jr. was old enough to follow the tabloid headlines that surrounded his parents' separation in 1990 and his father's financial implosion soon after. "Sometimes being a Trump," he acknowledged, "everyone kind of wants to see you fail."
But as he is increasingly making clear, the Trump taste for publicity eventually asserts itself.
"The patrimony of Donald Trump is publicity, maybe more than anything else," said David Patrick Columbia, the editor of the Web site New York Social Diary, recalling that Donald and Ivana Trump labored to make themselves a franchise on the New York social scene before they became one for the world.
The younger Trumps, Columbia added, "don't push themselves on anybody or anything, but they are working their way into the community in a very stable way."
As a newly minted Trump, Vanessa Haydon Trump seems born for the role. She grew up in a town house on the Upper East Side, has been modeling since childhood and is signed to Wilhelmina. Her mother, Bonnie Haydon, ran the Kay Models agency.
As a student and tennis star at the Dwight School on the Upper West Side, Vanessa - who has an athletic build, buttery tan, blond hair and sunny smile - joked a lot and usually wore jeans, said Shawn Modell, a lifelong friend. Vanessa focused her attentions on an intimate circle of friends, not on social advancement.
In fact, years later, she did not have to take any particular strides to marry rich. Donald Trump Sr. took care of that.
"I'm at this fashion show," Vanessa Trump said, recalling their meeting in 2003. "Donald Trump comes up to me with his son: 'Hi, I'm Donald Trump. I wanted to introduce you to my son Donald Trump Jr.'"
The three engaged in a brief, awkward conversation.
At intermission, the elder Trump again noticed a gorgeous girl nearby.
"Donald comes back up to me again, 'I don't think you've met my son Donald Trump Jr.,'" Vanessa Trump recalled. She remembers responding, "Yeah, we just met, five minutes ago."
Six weeks later, at a birthday party at a New York restaurant, they were introduced a third time, this time by a mutual friend. Neither remembered the other. "We talked for an hour," she recalled.
Then suddenly, something clicked: Wait, you were at that fashion show. Wait, you're "the one with the retarded dad!" Vanessa blurted out.
On Nov. 12, 2005, they married at Mar- a-Lago, the family's club in Florida. (Donald Trump Sr. had taken his son to task on "Larry King Live" for accepting a free engagement ring from a jeweler at a mall in New Jersey in exchange for publicly announcing his engagement there. "You have a name that is hot as a pistol, you have to be very careful with things like this," the elder Trump told King.)
The bride, who had been active on the charity circuit for years, was soon hauling her husband out to fashion shows and benefits, and the two began popping up in gossip and society columns. Observers on the circuit could hardly help but notice the similarity between the senior and junior Trumps. Both have a muscular top-heavy build - Don Jr. rowed crew while an undergraduate at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania. They share an anvil-shape chin they tend to thrust upward for cameras. (But, yes, Don has better hair).
But while the Queens-bred Donald Sr. is jackhammer-intense and almost smothering in his charisma, Donald Jr. is lighter in spirit. He laughs easily and often.
Charm, of course, is a crucial asset for any member of the family, said Peter Hauspurg, the chairman of Eastern Consolidated Properties, a Manhattan real estate investment firm. "Others are using celebrities to sell their business," Hauspurg said. But Donald Sr., he noted, is "his own celebrity."
It is that celebrity status that helps drive condominiums in Trump buildings to sell at a premium. In New York, condominiums flying the Trump name sold at a 36 percent premium over comparable properties in 2005, according to statistics compiled by the Corcoran Group.
The fame of the scion likely will only grow this January, when the eldest son and his sister replace their father's television co-stars, George Ross and Carolyn Kepcher.
"It's an hour-long infomercial," Don Jr. said of "The Apprentice." "People pay millions of dollars for a 30-second advertisement, we get to be on it for a full hour promoting all our projects." Still, certain factors may at least slow the couple's social ascent over the next year - parenthood, for one.
"I can build buildings all day long," Donald Jr. said. "This is something that will actually faze me."
Every sport is played at all levels. And because an expert will (almost) always win against lesser opposition, the different levels of player are usually segregated. For example, I could never enter a tennis tournament that included, say, Andy Roddick.
In golf the handicap system supposedly evens the playing field -- or should that be fairway? But the better player still has an advantage.
In bridge, though, a near-beginner can beat an expert in the short run by getting lucky. For example, the near-beginner's 20 percent line of play -- one that's successful 20 percent of the time -- works and the expert's 90 percent line fails. Also, a near-beginner, if willing to pay the entry fee, can compete against experts in most events. But some competitions are restricted by master-point totals.
At the Fall North American Bridge Championships in Hawaii last month, the Mini-Blue Ribbon Pairs was for players with at most 5,000 master points. The winners were Divakar Bhargava of Richmond, Va., and Joe Houde of St. Augustine, Fla. They did very well on the diagramed deal when Houde found a way to make four hearts despite the 5-0 trump split.
West's three clubs was a weak jump overcall. His hand had an extra trump and more distribution than normal, but perhaps he decided not to bid four clubs because that would have taken him past three no-trump. Now North jumped to four hearts. Many pairs would treat this as pre-emptive. They would cue-bid four clubs to show a high-card raise to four hearts, leaving open the possibility of slam exploration should the opener have a strong hand.
Houde, the declarer, took the first trick with his club ace, played his spade to dummy's queen and discarded a club on the spade ace. He continued by ruffing a spade in his hand and leading a heart to the king on the board, getting the bad news. South ruffed another spade in his hand (East threw a diamond), cashed his heart ace and played a heart to dummy's queen to give this end position:
Declarer, who needed two more tricks, called for the spade eight. East ruffed but then had to lead away from his diamond king around to dummy's queen.
Plus 620 was worth 23 match points out of 25.

Hempstead, N.Y. - Jets Coach Eric Mangini was asked a couple of trick questions yesterday. Fresh from his team's most dominating performance of the season, did Mangini think the Jets had emerged as the No. 1 team in the American Football Conference?
"We're trying to be the No. 1 team in Hempstead," Mangini said.
Did Mangini feel he was the toast of the town? Mangini, the 35-year-old-rookie coach, laughed but wisely sidestepped that trap question as well.
A lopsided victory against the hapless Green Bay Packers -- whose free-flinging, over-the-hill quarterback, Brett Favre, doesn't know he's over the hill -- is hardly grounds for being the toast of the town.
"I feel like it's really any other week," Mangini said. "It's been pretty consistent here. Nothing much has changed."
Many players and coaches come to New York and start to buy into a news media-created image that often has no basis. The only reality that matters in the business of pro football is winning.
Indeed, the real toast of the town was addressing another flock of news media 40 miles away inside Giants Stadium. Tom Coughlin, the beleaguered coach of the Giants, faced another firing squad after a fourth consecutive loss. Coughlin is being toasted and roasted all over town. While the Jets are 7-5 and rising, the Giants are a middling 6-6 and perhaps two losses away from missing the playoffs.
Mangini and Coughlin are fascinating studies: a young coach having no image to live up to and a veteran coach boxed in by an image. Mangini's young Jets are winning with grit and composure; Coughlin's veteran Giants are losing. Actually, the Giants are losing and are in disarray, a trait that has defined the team but is supposedly so un-Coughlin.
Coughlin was a law-and-order coach, an image the news media has instinctively encouraged. Coughlin bought into it.
To make his point about discipline early on, Coughlin indulged in silly maneuvers like fining players for not being five minutes early for team meetings, ostensibly to set the tone for discipline.
He set the tone for mutiny.
He preached discipline and composure, but through their four-game losing streak, the Giants -- and Coughlin -- have been anything but poised. The lasting image of the Coughlin regime may well be him flailing his arms, screaming and tearing down the sideline after Mathias Kiwanuka, a rookie defensive lineman who gave up on a sack of quarterback Vince Young during a last-minute loss to Tennessee.
Coughlin told his team yesterday that it had to play smarter.
"We're beating ourselves," he said. "We're hurting ourselves, and the fact of the matter is, the games are slipping away from our grasp by what's happening right in front of us on the field."
The perception of Coughlin's Giants is that they are an undisciplined team coach by an authoritarian.
If the coach doesn't listen, the next words he hears will be the echo of goodbye.
"We need to win a football game," Coughlin said. "We're going to stick together and find a way to win. That's what we're going to do."
He'd better, or these may well be the last four games of his tenure. The coach who chooses to stay the course invites disaster.
Veteran players know a fake when they see one; young players are too new and desperate to care.
Coughlin wraps himself in that image so tightly that it has begun to choke the life out of his team -- and his coaching career. After four consecutive losses, Coughlin should be listening.
Mangini, on the other hand, has been the stoical sideline presence, never too up, too low.
"We're excited about the progress we're making and there's still a quarter of the season left," Mangini said.
Coaches and players either buy or sell the image the news media create for them: the tough guy, the comedian, the clown, the hero. The only foundation is winning.
Mangini is fortunate not to have a persona to live up to: He's not the General (Coughlin), not the Tuna (Bill Parcells), not the Sphinx (Bill Belichick). He is a rookie coach trying to put together a winning season in his rookie year.
Mangini made an observation about the fragility of image, of toasts of the town.
"I appreciate the excitement, I appreciate the fans' excitement, and I think that's great," he said. "But if we lose track of the next game and get caught up in the other things that are happening, then that's when you let a game slip away and it really won't matter what happens outside of this building, if we're not continually focused on the task at hand."
Who knows how these next four weeks will turn out. The Jets could disintegrate and lose all four games and miss the playoffs. The veteran Giants could win the next four and win the division.
In a city where deep divisions of loyalty are expressed by rooting interests, the Jets, for now, have won the battle of the water cooler.

It is a standard mantra of bidding that when you find a major-suit fit, your only remaining problem is how high to bid. But can it be right to ignore that fit and play in no-trump? Obviously, yes. If there are only nine tricks available in both the major and no-trump, you would prefer to make three no-trump than to fail in four of your major.
Spotting those deals is difficult, though. You are more likely to be better off in no-trump when you have an 8-card fit than a 9- or 10-card, but not always. To add a layer of complexity, if you are competing in a match-pointed pair event, no-trump has added appeal. If both the no-trump and major-suit contracts produce the same number of tricks, that extra 10 points for playing in no-trump will be worth a fortune in match points.
The diagramed deal occurred during the Edgar Kaplan Blue Ribbon Pairs at the Fall Nationals in Hawaii last month. The winners, Fulvio Fantoni and Claudio Nunes from Italy, did very well by playing in three no-trump instead of four hearts.
Of course, if West had passed as dealer, not opened with a modern-style pre-empt, the Italians would surely have played in four hearts and presumably won 11 tricks, as did most North-South pairs.
When West's three-club opening was passed around to Fantoni (South), he could not make a takeout double with a singleton spade; he did not like the idea of overcalling three hearts with a relatively weak suit; and he had a club holding he wished to protect on opening lead. So he bid three no-trump.
West led his fourth-highest club, won by South's jack. Declarer played his spade jack, West taking the trick and continuing with the spade ten to dummy's queen. Two rounds of hearts put West on lead again, and he played his third spade. South won with dummy's king, took the club ace, led a heart to his hand, cashed the club king and ran the rest of the hearts ending on the board.
There were three cards left in each hand. West's distribution was known to have been 3-2-1-7 (or 4-2-0-7). This made the diamond finesse a heavy favorite to work. Also, if West had had the singleton diamond king, he probably would have opened one club, not three clubs. And South realized that if the diamond finesse was working, the declarers in hearts would be winning 11 tricks. Fantoni had to take that number too. So he played a diamond to his queen to collect two overtricks and a near-top.

The organizers of the Miss USA pageant are thinking of stripping the title from its 20-year- old holder because of what they consider are inappropriate "behavioral and personal issues," a Web site is reporting. The gossip site, TMZ.com, reported that pageant officials and <b>Donald Trump</b>, who with NBC-TV co- owns the Miss Universe Organization, met this week to discuss the future of the reigning queen <b>Tara Connor,</b> a Kentucky native who lives in New York and has made news for appearances at city bars, a drink in hand. The legal drinking age is 21. "We have to make a decision. There is no question about that," Trump said. If Connor loses, the runner-up, Miss California <b>Tamiko Nash, </b>would take over as Miss USA. (AP)


The French rocker <b>Johnny Hallyday</b>, a high profile supporter of the presidential hopeful <b>Nicolas Sarkozy</b>, intends to move to Switzerland to escape his country's tax rates. "Like a lot of French people, I'm sick of what they make us pay in taxes," Hallyday told Europe 1 radio. His impending departure was first reported by the weekly L'Express. "I love France," he said. "Even if I live elsewhere, I'm still a French citizen." Hallyday will spend six months and one day a year in the exclusive alpine resort of Gstaad, L'Express reported. France has reduced its top income tax bracket to 40 percent, but imposes an additional wealth tax on people who have assets worth €750,000 — about $985,000 — or more. (Reuters)


In a case reminiscent of <b>Mel Gibson's </b> roadside run-in with the police, an award-winning French actor has been sentenced to six months in prison and fined €8,000 for insulting and racially abusing the officers who stopped him just outside Paris last March, the BBC reported. The actor, <b>Samy Naceri</b>, 44, who received a best actor award this year at the Cannes Film Festival for his performance in "Indigènes," had pleaded guilty and apologized. He has said that at the time of the incident, which included a racial insult directed at a black officer, he had mixed medicine and alcohol. Naceri, whose father is Algerian and mother French, is to appear in court next week on charges of assaulting a man in a Paris restaurant.


Harry Potter can go back to battling Voldemort, at least for a while. The Georgia Board of Education has voted to reject a mother's petition to remove from library shelves the best- selling books by <b>J.K. Rowling </b>, The Associated Press reported. The mother, <b>Laura Mallory</b>, who has three children in elementary schools, has been trying for more than a year to have the books banned from schools in Gwinnett County, a suburb of Atlanta. "It's mainstreaming witchcraft in a subtle and deceptive manner," Mallory said. School officials argue that a ban on books referring to witchcraft would sweep away "Macbeth" and "Cinderella." According to the American Library Association, the Potter books have been challenged 115 times since 2000, more than any others in the 21st century.
Donald Trump gives me an interview, though he has his doubts.
"I would like the interview to be in the Sunday paper," he says.
He can't be worried about his exposure, so it must be his boundless appetite for bigger/taller/glitzier that makes him yearn for the larger readership of Sunday.
"Me, too," I reply. "But the only way that's going to happen is if I give Frank Rich my notes and let him write the column."
"I like Frank Rich," he says, his voice brimming with appreciation for a man whose circulation is bigger than mine.
"Me, too," I say.
Kurt Andersen, who jousted with the Donald as an editor at Spy, celebrates the "Daffy Duck" of deal-making in New York magazine this week as one of the "Reasons to Love New York," calling him "our 21st century reincarnation of P. T. Barnum and Diamond Jim Brady, John Gotti minus the criminal organization, the only white New Yorker who lives as large as the blingiest, dissiest rapper -- de trop personified."
When I call De Trop Trump at Mar-a-Lago, he's still ranting about "that big, fat slob Rosie O'Donnell." When he granted Tara Conner, the naughty beauty queen, a second chance this week, Rosie made a crack on "The View" about an oft-married snake-oil salesman not being the best person to pass moral judgments. He slimed back, and the Great American Food Fight was on.
This past year was rife with mistakes -- global mistakes, bigoted tirades, underwear mishaps. Winding up 2006, I asked the celebrity arbiter of who-can-stay and who-must-go about redemption.
In the case of Hollywood's overexposed and underdressed young ladies of the night, Mr. Trump judiciously notes that in some cases, carousing is good for your career. His rule is, the more talented you are, the less you should mindlessly party. But if mindlessly partying is your talent, go for it.
"Britney," he says, "doesn't carry it off as well as Paris."
How about those other international party girls, the Bush twins?
"When you're a president who has destroyed the lives of probably a million people, our soldiers and Iraqis who are maimed and killed -- you see children going into school in Baghdad with no arms and legs -- I don't think Bush's kids should be having lots of fun in Argentina," he says.
Should viewers give Katie Couric another look?
If you can't get the ratings, he says, you're cooked: "I like Katie, but she's hit bottom and she'll stay there. She made a terrible, tragic mistake for her career. She looks extremely unhappy on the show. I watched her the other night, and she's not the same Katie."
Can Gwyneth rebound from her comments comparing Americans unfavorably with Brits? "Gwyneth Paltrow is a good actress with average looks," he says. "She likes to ride the high English horse. But when she puts down this country that gave her more than she should have had, it's disgusting."
Michael Richards and Judith Regan made irredeemable mistakes, in his view, as did Al Gore and John Kerry, when they couldn't win winnable elections, and W., Cheney and Rummy, when they invaded Iraq.
"No matter how long we stay in Iraq, no matter how many soldiers we send, the day we leave, the meanest, most vicious, most brilliant man in the country, a man who makes Saddam Hussein look like a baby, will take over and spit on the American flag," he says. "Bush will go down as the worst and by far the dumbest president in history."
Colin Powell, he considers irredeemable as well: "He's speaking up now, but he's no longer relevant. I call him a pathetic and sad figure."
He thinks John McCain has lost the 2008 election by pushing to send more troops to Iraq but that Hillary should be forgiven for her "horrendous" vote to authorize the war. "Don't forget that decision was based on lies given to her," he says. "She's very smart and has a major chance to be our next president."
He deems it "not a good sign" that Barack Obama got into a sketchy real estate deal with a sleazy Chicago political figure. "But he's got some wonderful qualities," Mr. Trump says, and deserves another chance.
And how about Monica Lewinsky, who just graduated from the London School of Economics? "It's good she graduated," he says. "She's been through a lot."
When it comes to having an opinion on everything, Trump towers.

 SAN FRANCISCO, Dec. 29 — In brand-new offices with a still-empty game room and enough space to triple their staff of nearly 30, a trio of entrepreneurs is leading an Internet start-up with an improbable mission: to out-Google Google. 
The three started Powerset, a company whose aim is to deliver better answers than any other search engine — including Google — by letting users type questions in plain English. And they have made believers of Silicon Valley investors whose fortunes turn on identifying the next big thing.
“There’s definitely a segment of the market that thinks we are crazy,” said Charles Moldow, a partner at Foundation Capital, a venture capital firm that is Powerset’s principal financial backer. “In 2000, some people thought Google was crazy.”
Powerset is hardly alone. Even as Google continues to outmaneuver its main search rivals, Yahoo and Microsoft, plenty of newcomers — with names like hakia, ChaCha and Snap — are trying to beat the company at its own game. And Wikia Inc., a company started by a founder of Wikipedia, plans to develop a search engine that, like the popular Web-based encyclopedia, would be built by a community of programmers and users.
These ambitious quests reflect the renewed optimism sweeping technology centers like Silicon Valley and fueling a nascent Internet boom. It also shows how much the new Internet economy resembles a planetary system where everything and everyone orbits around search in general, and around Google in particular. 
Silicon Valley is filled with start-ups whose main business proposition is to be bought by Google, or for that matter by Yahoo or Microsoft. Countless other start-ups rely on Google as their primary driver of traffic or on Google’s powerful advertising system as their primary source of income. Virtually all new companies compete with Google for scarce engineering talent. And divining Google’s next move has become a fixation for scores of technology blogs and a favorite parlor game among technology investors.
“There is way too much obsession with search, as if it were the end of the world,” said Esther Dyson, a well-known technology investor and forecaster. “Google equals money equals search equals search advertising; it all gets combined as if this is the last great business model.”
It may not be the last great business model, but Google has proved that search linked to advertising is a very large and lucrative business, and everyone — including Ms. Dyson, who invested a small sum in Powerset — seems to want a piece of it. 
Since the beginning of 2004, venture capitalists have put nearly $350 million into no fewer than 79 start-ups that had something to do with Internet search, according to the National Venture Capital Association, an industry group. 
An overwhelming majority are not trying to take Google head on, but rather are focusing on specialized slices of the search world, like searching for videos, blog postings or medical information. Since Google’s stated mission is to organize all of the world’s information, they may still find themselves in the search giant’s cross hairs. That is not necessarily bad, as being acquired by Google could be a financial bonanza for some of these entrepreneurs and investors.
But in the current boom, there is money even for those with the audacious goal of becoming a better Google.
Powerset recently received $12.5 million in financing. Hakia, which like Powerset is trying to create a “natural language” search engine, got $16 million. Another $16 million went to Snap, which has focused on presenting search results in a more compelling way and is experimenting with a new advertising model. And ChaCha, which uses paid researchers that act as virtual reference librarians to provide answers to users’ queries, got $6.1 million. 
Still, recent history suggests that gaining traction is going to be difficult. Of dozens of search start-ups that were introduced in recent years, none had more than a 1 percent share of the United States search market in November, according to Nielsen NetRatings, a research firm that measures Internet traffic.
Amassing a large audience has proved to be a challenge even for those with a track record and resources. Consider A9, a search engine owned by Amazon.com that received positive reviews when it began in 2004 and was run by Udi Manber, a widely recognized search specialist. Despite some innovative features and early successes, A9 has captured only a tiny share of the market. Mr. Manber now works for Google, where he is vice president of engineering.
The setback apparently has not stopped Amazon or its chief executive, Jeffrey P. Bezos, from pursuing profits in search. ChaCha said it counts an investment company owned by Mr. Bezos among its backers, and Amazon is an investor in Wikia. An Amazon spokeswoman said Mr. Bezos does not comment about his personal investments.
Some start-ups are similarly bullish. “We expect to be one of the top three search engines,” said Riza C. Berkan, the chief executive of hakia. It is a bold claim, given that hakia’s technology is not yet ready for prime time, and Mr. Berkan readily concedes it will take time to perfect it.
The dream, however, is quintessential Silicon Valley. 
“It is hard for me to believe that anybody thinks they can take Google’s business from Google,” said Randy Komisar, a venture capitalist who was once known as Silicon Valley’s “virtual C.E.O.” for his role as a mentor to scores of technology firms. “But to call the game over because Google has been such a success would be to deny history.”
In some ways, the willingness of so many to make multimillion-dollar investments to take on Google and other search companies represents a startling change. In the late 1990s, when Microsoft dominated the technology world, inventors and investors did everything they could to avoid competing with the software company. 
Yet many of today’s search start-ups are putting themselves squarely in the path of the Google steamroller. Most explain that decision in similar ways. 
They say that Google’s dominance today is different from Microsoft’s in the late 90s when its operating system was a virtual monopoly and nearly impossible to break. In the Internet search industry, “you earn your right to be in business every day, page view after page view, click after click,” said Barney Pell, a founder and the chief executive of Powerset, whose search service is not yet available.
They also say that the market for search simply is too large to resist. Google, which, according to Nielsen, handles about half of all Internet searches in the United States, is valued at an astonishing $141 billion. So, the reasoning goes, anyone who can grab even a small slice of the search market could be well rewarded. 
“You don’t need to be No. 1 to be worth billions of dollars,” said Allen Morgan, a partner at Mayfield Fund, a venture capital firm that invested $10 million in Snap. The company is also backed by Bill Gross, an Internet financier who pioneered the idea of linking ads and search results, only to see Google seize the powerful business model and improve on it.
 Almost all of today’s search entrepreneurs also say that Google’s success lends credibility to their own long-shot quest. 
When Lawrence Page and Sergey Brin first started tinkering with what would become Google, other search engines like AltaVista and Lycos and Excite were dominant. But the companies that owned them were distracted by efforts to diversify their businesses, and they took their eye off the ball of Internet search and stopped innovating.
Some now say that search has not evolved much in years, and that Google is similarly distracted as it introduces new products like word processors, spreadsheets and online payment systems and expands into online video, social networking and other businesses. 
“The more Google starts to think about taking on Microsoft, the less it is a pure search play, and the more it opens the door for new innovations,” said Mr. Moldow, the Foundation Capital partner. “That’s great for us.”
But at the same time, Google, Yahoo and Microsoft have thousands of engineers, including some of the world’s top search specialists, working on improving their search results. And they have spent billions building vast computer networks so they can respond instantly to the endless stream of queries from around the world. 
Search “is becoming an increasingly capital-intensive business,” said Marissa Mayer, Google’s vice president for search. That makes it harder for start-ups to catch up to the giants, she said.
That is not stopping entrepreneurs from betting that they can. Powerset has search and natural-language experts among its two dozen employees, including former top engineers from Yahoo and a former chief linguist from Ask Jeeves, Ask.com’s predecessor. They are the kind of people who could easily land jobs at Google or Microsoft or Yahoo. 
Steve Newcomb, a Powerset founder and veteran of several successful start-ups, said his company could become the next Google. Or, he said, if Google or someone else perfected natural-language search before Powerset, then his company would make a great acquisition for one of the other search companies. “We are a huge story no matter what,” he said. 
Ms. Dyson, the technology commentator and Powerset investor, captured the optimism more concisely and with less swagger. “I love Google,” she said, “but I love the march of history.”
ONE day late last month, inside a reading room in the library at Queens College, a young visitor from Sweden named Erik Akerberg was handed a gold-plated Selmer trumpet with a small ding in the bell. 
Mr. Akerberg fingered the valves knowingly, making sure that they sprang back to attention, and blew a little warm air into the mouthpiece before placing it in the instrument. Then he held the trumpet in front of him. “All right,” he said nervously. Drawing a breath, he put the horn to his mouth, and he began to play. 
Mr. Akerberg, a 27-year-old amateur trumpet player from Stockholm spending a semester studying business at Berkeley College in Manhattan, was anxious, and with good reason. He was holding one of the Holy Grails of music, a trumpet that once belonged to Louis Armstrong. And his first thought was an anxious one: Just don’t drop the thing. “That’s not going to happen,” he recalled thinking. “That can’t happen.” 
But the fear was quickly replaced by wondering: “What will the sound — my sound — be on Louis Armstrong’s horn?” 
Gradually, as he relaxed, stilted notes and phrases gave way to robust musical sentences. Repeating a run of notes several times, Mr. Akerberg peppered the improvisation occasionally with a blue note or a bent tone as he gained ease. 
Mr. Akerberg was in good company. Among trumpeters who have made a pilgrimage to Flushing and ended up playing Armstrong’s horns are such members of jazz royalty as Wynton Marsalis, Arturo Sandoval and Jon Faddis. 
 The horns in question are five gold-plated trumpets, which were discovered in 1983 — after the death of Armstrong’s wife, Lucille — in Armstrong’s longtime home in nearby Corona. Two are on display, one at the college’s Louis Armstrong Archives, the other at the Louis Armstrong House. 
The other three are kept under wraps, nestled in a hard brown case within the Armstrong Archives, in the Queens College library. Yet on rare occasions — “when the vibe is right,” said Michael Cogswell, director of both the archives and the house — the trumpets are wheeled out on an unceremonious wooden library cart and handed to schoolchildren to hold, or to trumpeters who, with awe, press their lips to history. To date, only about two dozen people have had this privilege since the archives opened in 1994. 
“There is a talismanic power to an artifact like this,” Mr. Cogswell said. “For people to actually hold Louis’s own trumpet in their hands, it does touch them in a good way, in a beautiful way.”
The trumpets are objects of such reverence that some visitors have declined the offer. But for all the nightmares that could result, one argument trumps them all: Louis would have wanted it this way. The proof of this lies in the archives, in the dozens of photographs showing the musician backstage after concerts with fans enthusiastically trying out his fabled horns. 
For Mr. Cogswell, it’s a tightrope of access versus preservation, but so far the limited exposure of the trumpets — perhaps two to four people play them a year — does not raise concern, he said. Still, fingerprints are wiped off immediately after the trumpets are handled, and instruments are annually deep-cleaned, lubricated and polished. 
“My only regret is that there might have been some valuable DNA in there that we lost,” Mr. Cogswell said dryly. “What with cloning and everything today, you never know. We might have made a big mistake cleaning these horns the first time.”
This particular morning, after improvising awhile on a second horn, Mr. Akerberg pulled it away from his mouth, opened his eyes, caught his breath, and looked down at the instrument. “This is great,” he announced with a satisfied nod.
Picking up the third horn, an ornate trumpet decorated with floral chasing that crawled across the bell-pipe and into the bell, Mr. Akerberg posed as a friend dutifully snapped photos that showed him standing under the poster-size pictures of Armstrong that decorate the archives’ reading room. As he played on, including the melody from the song “Chameleon,” the notes drifted through an open window into the small courtyard outside, where the few students milling about seemed not to notice.
 In the Senior Pairs at the Edgar Kaplan Winter Regional in Midtown Manhattan on Dec. 27, Augie Boehm and Seymour Reich of New York finished first, ahead of Al Pagan of Hackensack, N.J., and Martin Weiss of Fort Lee, N.J.; and Michael Kallman and Jean Ludwig of New York.
 The winners did well on the diagramed deal.
 West opened one heart in the modern style. (When you are thinking of opening with minimum values, consider two things: Are you going to bid a suit that you are happy for partner to lead at trick one, in particular if he holds king-doubleton; and do you have a comfortable rebid whatever partner responds? This hand answers positively to these questions.) East’s decision to pass is strange. With three-card heart support and a singleton, it would seem normal to raise to two hearts. If you had been South, what would you have done now?
 You could jump to four spades or to three no-trump, trusting partner to have a few useful goodies. But Boehm decided to double, keeping his options open and hoping to learn something beneficial for the play.
 Surprise, surprise: West passed, and partner advanced one spade. Now, not wanting a heart lead straight through his king-jack, South felt endplayed into bidding three no-trump. Boehm might also have been influenced by his own workmanlike book, “Three Notrump in Depth” (HNB Publishing, 2006). In it he discusses the bidding, declarer play and defense of our favorite contract.
 Notice that four spades, even when played by South, should lose four tricks: two hearts, one diamond and one club.
 If West had led fourth-highest from his longest and strongest, he would have defeated three no-trump. But he tried a sneak attack, selecting the club six. Declarer won with his jack and played the diamond king. To keep South to his contract, East had to hold up his ace, but understandably he did not, so Boehm took 10 tricks (six spades, two diamonds and two clubs) for a shared top.

 Bridge has seen its fair share of marriages and divorces. Tomorrow, though, is the 20th anniversary of the first date of Eileen Brenner and Michael Pickert of Livingston, N.J.
 They used to play a lot of bridge but now restrict their time at the table. Later this month they will compete in the final of the New Jersey Double Knockout with their teammates, Alex Allen of Annandale, N.J., and Abe Pineles of Jackson, N.J. These team events are fun because you must be beaten twice to be eliminated. The diagramed deal comes from their semifinal match.
 Pickert (South) had to make a negative double on the first round because a two-spade response would have been nonforcing (a so-called negative free bid). The rest of the auction was natural. Note, though, East’s undisciplined three-club rebid; he said it all on the first round. Three clubs doubled would have cost 800, but it was impossible for South to double for a second time.
 Declarer, after winning the club lead on the board with the ace, was unwilling to play a heart to his ace and a heart to dummy’s jack. He was afraid that East would win with the queen from an initial doubleton, cash the club king and continue with a third club, promoting West’s heart ten as a trick. Although we can see that that would not have happened, it was lucky South did not adopt this line, because the bad heart break would have led to his defeat.
 Instead South played a spade to his ace, cashed the spade king, discarding a club from the dummy, and led his diamond, dummy’s ten losing to East’s queen. East cashed the club king, then played the spade nine, covered by the jack and queen and ruffed on the board.
 This line of defense, forcing the dummy to ruff, suggested that the trumps were breaking badly. Declarer felt that East had 3-1-3-6 distribution, but just to check, South called for a low diamond, ruffing when East played the nine. Declarer continued with a heart to dummy’s king (necessary if East had the singleton queen), took a diamond ruff in his hand and cashed the spade eight to give this end position:




 NORTH —  J K J —



 WEST —  Q 10 5 —  —

 EAST —  —  —  Q 9 8



 SOUTH 2 A 9 —  —




 The lead of the last spade assured two more trump tricks for Pickert, 10 in all and a beaming smile from his partner at and away from the bridge table.
 In the other room the declarer lost his way, and Pickert’s team gained 13 international match points.
Do health warnings on cigarette packages really work? Yes, but only if they are prominent, include graphics and have recently been updated, an international survey has found.
The researchers analyzed data from 15,000 smokers in Canada, the United States, Britain and Australia. The survey, to be published in the March issue of The American Journal of Preventive Medicine, asked several questions to determine if smokers had noticed the warnings and if they had any effect.
Canadian cigarettes carry a warning and illustration that covers 50 percent of the back and front of the package, and 16 versions are regularly rotated. The program began in 2000. In Britain, a text warning covered 6 percent of the front and back of the package until 2003, when a revised package appeared with 16 larger rotating warnings. Australian cigarettes carry a text covering a quarter of the front and a third of the back of the package. In the United States, there are four rotating warnings printed on the side of the pack only, and they have not changed since 1984.
The Canadian design was the most effective at getting smokers to notice the warning, and the United States package was least effective: 60 percent of Canadian smokers often noticed the warning, compared with 30 percent of smokers in the United States.
The revised package in Britain nearly doubled the percentage of smokers who often took notice of it.
“The two main ingredients in an effective warning are refreshing them and using pictures that communicate health risks,” said David Hammond, the study’s lead author and an assistant professor of health studies at the University of Waterloo in Ontario. “Quite simply, pictures communicate things that words alone cannot.”
The same night that some rather questionable choices were under consideration in the jazz categories at the Grammy Awards, there was the trumpeter John McNeil, one of the best improvisers working in jazz, performing in the small back room of Biscuit, a barbecue restaurant in Park Slope, Brooklyn. Mr. McNeil plays at Biscuit every Sunday, leading a band with the tenor saxophonist Bill McHenry. 
The room was full and the music was bright, swinging and complicated. This is just one of Mr. McNeil’s recent bands, and its repertory is a clutch of tough little pieces from the 1950s by Russ Freeman, Gerry Mulligan, Dizzy Gillespie, Wilbur Harden and others. After a year the gig has become one of the best regular jazz events in the city.
Mr. McNeil is a kind of trickster figure. How else to explain his newest group, My Band Foot Foot? Its mandate is to play arrangements of songs by the Shaggs, the trio of desperately untalented New Hampshire sisters who made a single album in 1969, “Philosophy of the World,” a milestone of pop folk-art. The band will play its first performance this Saturday at the Cornelia Street Café in Greenwich Village. 
Medium size, stocky, white-haired, with large, hooded eyes hidden by glasses, he seems armored, moving stiffly and wearing fingerless gloves onstage in the winter. Ritually he warms up his fingering hand with the flame from a candle. But when he plays, nothing is occluded: he delivers high-level improvisations at fairly quiet volume with astonishing harmonic acuity and a uniquely liquid, even sound. 
Between songs come gallows-humor microphone breaks. “This is the part of the show where the band plays the blues, and one of us talks over it,” he baritone-deadpanned toward the end of a set on Sunday. “I don’t talk very well over this kind of happy, major-key blues, though. Maybe I could do it over a blues in E. It would have to slow down. And I could tell you about my childhood. Which was really painful. Any- way. ...”
Five years ago Mr. McNeil, who is now 58, started making records for the small Omnitone label. There are three now — “This Way Out,” “Sleep Won’t Come” and “East Coast Cool” — and they have all been startling. Here was a mature composer and a first-rate player, pulling together jazz’s postwar strands: bebop language to the letter, tricky-meter tunes, free jazz, 20th-century classical harmony. (Listen to a solo like the poised, singing one he plays on “Wanwood,” from “East Coast Cool”: moving all around the horn, it keeps offering fresh harmonic choices as it moves among chords.) 
The records were playful too, full of wicked personality, like Mr. McNeil himself. 
But who is he? You might still have to ask musicians to know. He came to New York in 1974 and quickly developed a high reputation among musicians, first as a sideman with Horace Silver and the Thad Jones-Mel Lewis big band, later as a bandleader himself. (A 1979 album he made with the trumpeter Tom Harrell, “Look to the Sky,” became a favorite among trumpet players.) Then, by public traces, not much. He made a string of records — some of them perfunctory by his own admission — on the Danish label Steeplechase, and he performed rarely from the late ’80s to the late ’90s.
One reason for his obscurity was a constitutional resistance to self-promotion. When asked to construct a thorough genealogy of jazz trumpet players up to 1993 for the landmark jazz-studies book “Thinking in Jazz,” by Paul Berliner, he omitted himself. (Were he in it, he might be shown as coming out of Thad Jones and Freddie Hubbard, with a little of Blue Mitchell’s dark, warm sound, and Lester Bowie’s imagination in free improvising.) 
“Do I know what I can do?” he asked, rhetorically, in a recent conversation. “Yeah, of course. I can handle changes, I can play in all keys, I can write some good music. I just can’t say that.”
Another was day work. He started teaching occasional clinics at the New England Conservatory in Boston, then took over a music theory class there in 1989, which he has continued, teaching two days a week. Hundreds of his students are scattered around the jazz scene, including Mr. McHenry and Dave Douglas. Mr. McNeil is regarded as a master not only of trumpet technique but also of the practical and creative applications of harmonic theory. 
But the big reason was Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease, a neural disorder that affects the nerves and, by extension, the muscles in the extremities of the body. The illness is hereditary: his father had it, though the signs didn’t show until he was in his 70s. Growing up in Yreka (pronounced why-REE-kuh), Calif., near the Oregon border, Mr. McNeil dealt with it from childhood, wearing braces from his legs to his neck from the ages of 7 through 16, when a series of operations relieved him of the braces. 
In the late ’50s Mr. McNeil saw Louis Armstrong on Milton Berle’s show. Inspired, he taught himself how to play trumpet and read music, but burdened himself with poor technique; at the University of Portland in Oregon, a teacher straightened him out. It was not the last time he would be starting from scratch.
Starting around 1982 there were days when he couldn’t make his fingers do what he wanted. And whereas Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease rarely affects the muscles of the face, in Mr. McNeil’s case it did, as well as the tongue and the diaphragm. “So, basically, I have the big three for trumpet playing,” he said, laughing. 
One of those bad days was captured on an album, “The Things We Did Last Summer.” It spooked Mr. McNeil, and though he kept touring, he decided not to record again for a while. “Then I just stopped everything,” he said. “The irregularity was maddening. I began to think I didn’t have any talent. It does strange things to your confidence. You don’t have to fail absolutely to have no confidence: you just have to fail every so often.” 
From 1983 to 1996 he made no more records; he concentrated on technique. (He also underwent surgery to have his spine reconstructed.) He learned what he now had to do to execute his ideas: he needed to be amplified and to develop a method of correctly balancing the muscles in his face to maintain sufficient compression. 
In 1997 he discovered he could not extend the fingers in his right hand, which he uses for fingering his instrument. During two years he bought himself a left-handed trumpet, learned how to finger with his left hand and made a record left-handed. (It was called “Fortuity,” and Allan Chase, the saxophonist on the record, insists he still can’t tell the difference.) Finally he regained the use of his right hand, went back to his normal playing practice and started his midlife renewal, forming one band after another and making music on his own terms. 
Mr. McNeil has never defined himself by the illness. (During his high school years he had diagnostic tests at the Mayo Clinic, and was told that he should not pursue a career as a musician. He still feels he is avenging that advice.) He has largely hidden it from the public, though now he says it might be useful for people to know about it — “so they can see it’s no big deal,” he explained.
Recently he was fitted for some handsome new custom-made finger braces that allow him to curve his fingers better. “And they’re sterling silver,” he said, showing them off between sets. “So I have a little bit of a pimp thing going on.”
 You have a 5-3 spade fit and a 4-4 heart fit. Which would you usually select as your trump suit? Suppose you have a 5-4 spade fit and 4-4 heart fit. Would that change your answer?
 When you have a 4-4 fit that is not the trump suit, at best you can win four tricks from it. But if it is the trump suit, it will often provide a fifth trick. You can probably draw trumps in three rounds and arrange to ruff a loser in one hand or the other to get the extra trick.
 A 5-3 side suit will produce at most five tricks. If you make it the trump suit, to gain a sixth trick you must either take a ruff in the shorter trump hand or ruff three times in the longer trump hand, both of which are unlikely.
 So generally you should prefer the 4-4 fit as your trump suit and the 5-3 fit to be a side suit, especially since it may provide useful discards on the fourth and fifth cards.
 There are occasions, though, when the 5-3 fit will make the better trump suit  in particular when the 5-3 fit is strong, the 4-4 fit weaker and the only concern is not losing trump tricks.
 When you add a ninth card, producing a 5-4 fit, the same considerations apply.
 The diagramed deal provides an example. It occurred during the Flight A Swiss Teams on Feb. 18 at the New England Knockout Regional in Cromwell, Conn.
 The winners were Jeff Aker of Briarcliff, N.Y.; Bob Feller of Guilderland, N.Y.; Simon Kantor of Agawam, Mass.; and Glenn Milgrim of New York. They finished less than half a match ahead of Sylwia and Michael McNamara and Benjamin Rottman of White Plains and Lee Ohliger of Ridgewood, N.J.
 To make a small slam South must lose at most one trick in the majors. At the other table South was in six hearts. After a club lead to the queen, king and ace, to make his contract declarer had immediately to play a heart to dummy’s nine. He was never going to do that and drifted down one.
 Aker (South) and Milgrim had the given auction to six spades, the superior slam because their trump suit was stronger. Two no-trump was a game-forcing spade raise. Three clubs warned of a minimum opening bid. Three no-trump announced a singleton club with 14 or 15 high-card points. (He did not count the club queen.) Four no-trump was Roman Key Card Blackwood, the reply showing two key cards (one ace and the trump king, or two aces) and the trump queen.
 South took the first trick with his club ace, drew trumps in two rounds, cashed dummy’s top diamonds, ruffed a diamond in his hand, trumped a club on the board and ruffed a diamond in his hand to give this end position:



 
 NORTH K Q 9 6 3   

 Now Aker made the play that guaranteed the contract whatever the distribution of the heart suit. He led the jack from his hand.
 West did not play his king, so declarer continued with a low heart to dummy’s queen.
 Plus 100 and plus 1,430 gave the winners 17 international match points on the board.
ATLANTIC CITY, March 12 (AP)  Trump Entertainment Resorts, the casino company, said Monday that it had hired Merrill Lynch to help it explore strategic alternatives, which could include the possibility of a sale.
Trump Resorts said it had retained Merrill to assist in identifying and evaluating capital structure, financing and other matters. It would not comment further.
”The real question is whether Trump is in play,” Adam Steinberg, an analyst with Morgan Joseph & Company, wrote in a research report Monday. 
As part of a 2004 bankruptcy reorganization, Donald J. Trump gave up majority control to his bondholders while remaining the company’s largest individual stockholder. He declined to be interviewed on Monday.
Trump Entertainment properties include the Trump Taj Mahal Casino Resort and the Trump Plaza Hotel and Casino, on the Boardwalk in Atlantic City, and the Trump Marina Hotel Casino, in the Marina district.
Mario Kontomerkos, an analyst with J. P. Morgan Securities, wrote Monday that the hiring of Merrill Lynch appeared to formalize a process that had been under way for months at Trump Entertainment. He said a sale of the entire company appeared unlikely because of tax and debt questions.
STRATTON, Vt., March 15  The 1260 is the next revolution in snowboarding  literally  after a 1080-degree spin (three full rotations), which was a money trick at the Winter Olympics last year.
For the past half-dozen years, trick progression in snowboarding has moved from 900-degree revolutions, to 1080s, called 10s, and on to 1260s (three and a half rotations). And with such an emphasis on spinning, some riders have suggested the sport might be blurring what everyone seems to agree is its most important element: style.
“Some guys are doing 1260s, but now you have to figure out how to add grabs,” Mason Aguirre, who finished fourth at the Winter Games, said, referring to maneuvers in which a rider reaches down and grabs his board while airborne. “Judges will dock you points if you don’t grab, because it doesn’t look good.”
Few sports stress aesthetics like snowboarding.
The International Ski Federation, the sanctioning body for snowboarding at the Olympics, requires one straight aerial and one rotation during runs. But most judged competitions, especially in the United States, have no compulsory elements.
“We don’t want that for our sport,” said Greg Johnson, competition director at the U.S. Open of Snowboarding, where slopestyle finals begin Friday at Stratton Mountain. “When riders have routines, everything becomes homogenous. That’s a very bad thing for snowboarding. Snowboarding has to be creative.”
In order to establish a baseline for competitions, judges  all of whom are trained  watch practice runs to gauge how riders are performing at a particular event. As a result, each event is judged according to a unique standard. Then, during runs, riders are evaluated on a number of factors, including difficulty of tricks, amplitude (height), how a rider grabs, whether his hand touches down and, especially, style.
But scores are still based on overall impression, and the judges reward innovation, which allows for a wide range of subjective interpretation. “I think it’s the hardest sport to judge, for sure,” Johnson said.
And although judging has not been without controversy, most riders want to retain its interpretive elements.
“Style is such a huge part of snowboarding,” said Travis Rice, who won a silver medal in slopestyle at the Winter X Games in January.
Said Aguirre: “I don’t think snowboarding should be a spin-to-win sport. Tricks should look stylie.” 
When it comes to barriers and benchmarks, baseball has a .400 batting average. Running has a four-minute mile. And snowboarding has, by most accounts, a 1440-degree spin (four rotations).
Only eight riders can land a 1260 on a slopestyle course, and fewer can land one in a halfpipe  and none with any style, according to Johnson.
And with the largest superpipes now 22 feet tall, and the cutting equipment used to make them nearly maxed out, spins may have scratched the upper limits of what is possible.
When that happens, and all the riders can perform the same number of rotations in the air, then style will become even more important, Johnson said. 
“Style elements become more important for bigger rotations,” he said. “All things being equal, it’s all about who has the most style, a certain élan in the pipe.”
Rice has advocated a more personal approach to trick progression.
“A lot of it lies in individual style and different ways to make a trick your own, rather than another rotation,” he said.
In 2004 Rice innovated a double-cork  an off-axis spin  almost by accident while soaring 90 feet through the backcountry of Utah’s Wasatch Mountains. While launching off a jump at a place known as the Pyramid Gap, he became more off-axis than he intended while spinning a frontside 900.
The trick, which has suggested new possibilities beyond simply spinning, has since been introduced during competitions. Several riders  including the 2006 Olympic halfpipe gold medal winner, Shaun White  have been working on landing variations on it.
Meanwhile, women’s riding has more room to grow.
“I don’t think that’s the case for women’s snowboarding, as women have been behind the men,” said Kelly Clark, the 2002 Olympic gold medal winner in halfpipe.
Clark suggested the upper level for progressing women’s spins would be 1080s  three full rotations. Female riders, a few of whom first pulled 900s in 2003, have begun landing them back-to-back during pipe runs.
When Jake Burton Carpenter founded the U.S. Open of Snowboarding 25 years ago, he had no sponsors, he used an upside-down kitchen table as a start gate, and his biggest concern was finding riders competent to get down the mountain without falling.
Now riders launch 40 feet above a halfpipe, spinning three and a half rotations in the air.
“I don’t think we’ll see snowboarding as spin-crazy in the next five years as it has been in the past five years,” Carpenter said. “Every time the sport starts to get too gymnastically oriented, the sport rebels.”
I STILL remember my first taste of Condrieu. It was at Lutèce umpteen years ago, and it accompanied a warm lobster salad. Ever since then, to me, Condrieu and lobster were like pearls and a black dress. 
So naturally, luxuriating in the honeysuckle, melon, candied lemon and floral flavors in our wonderful array of Condrieus, I assumed lobster would star in my pairing. 
That was until I had dinner at Frederick’s Madison a few weeks ago, and ordered Vincent Chirico’s chicken with fingerling potatoes and cipollini onions. It’s not often that I clean my plate, but the dish provided such a delectable balance of richness and acidity, with hints of herb and garlic, that I threw restraint to the winds. 
Though I drank red wine with the chicken that evening because my dining partner insisted, I kept thinking about the Condrieus that I had tasted just the day before. So I forgot about lobster and requested the recipe, and now you have it. 
The braise is made with dark chicken meat, which retains its succulence better than white, making it a perfect dinner party dish, suitable for preparing an hour or two in advance and reheating ever so gently. The olive oil used for poaching the potatoes can be strained and refrigerated to recycle as an herbed oil for other cooking purposes.
Though the red we drank was fine with the dish, a white, like a rich viognier with a pedigree — a Condrieu, of course — suits it in far better style.
What is it with the rash of new set-top boxes lately? One recent box brings the best of the Internet to your TV screen, like podcasts, Web videos and Internet radio. Another one is a video recorder that you can operate from anywhere in the world (for example, tell it to record a show), using only your cellphone. 
There’s even a product that displays slide shows and videos that your friends send to it from their computers — great if they have a new baby and you’re a technophobe.
O.K., just kidding. There aren’t really three set-top boxes like that — they are, in fact, all one box. And it’s not even a new one; it’s the TiVo, which has been around for years. But for the last year, TiVo the company has been quietly adding features that take the machine well beyond its original function as a video recorder and turn it into a surprisingly versatile Internet portal.
TiVo has become synonymous with the life-changing, time-shifting magic of a digital video recorder. You can pause live TV or rewind it. You can auto-record every episode of a favorite series. You can skip commercials. You can watch a one-hour “American Idol” episode in 23 minutes — by skipping over the recaps, the previews and the chitchat.
But the cable TV companies now offer video recorders of their own. The monthly fee is about the same as TiVo’s — around $10 a month. (TiVo, after you buy the unit, costs $8.30 to $17 a month to subscribe to its service, depending on how far in advance you’re willing to pay.) Users merely lease the cable company’s box, whereas a new TiVo Series 2 costs $100, and the high-definition Series 3 is $800. The TiVo’s software is light-years more polished and reliable, but to the masses, a “free” box trumps everything. 
Clearly, TiVo had to do something to differentiate itself. Its master plan: to tap the Internet for material and features.
Here’s a look at some of the new features that have been automatically beamed into existing Series 2 and 3 TiVo boxes in the last year. Most require the TiVo to be connected to a broadband Internet connection, wirelessly or not.
BROADCAST HOME MOVIES This feature, only one week old, lets you send home movies and photo slide shows from your computer directly into the “Now Playing” lists of TiVo owners who might enjoy them.
You upload your raw material at OneTrueMedia.com, where you can add a musical soundtrack, if you like. Then you’re given a numeric password, which you supply to any TiVo owner who wants to be able to tune in to your new “channel.” 
More Video »
The rest is automatic. From now on, any new movies that you upload automatically appear in the TiVo owners’ Now Playing lists. 
Grade: A–. It’s too bad that you, the uploader, have to pay by the month ($4) or year ($40) for this service; a fee for each movie would make more sense. Even so, this service opens up a magical new conduit to other people’s TV sets that’s never been available. It would be hard to imagine an easier, faster way to let parents or grandparents watch their distant offspring grow up.
CELLPHONE PROGRAMMING You can now download a subset of the TiVo’s software onto a Verizon cellphone. You can use it to search the TV listings and command your TiVo, back at home, to record any show or series, even if you give it only 15 minutes’ notice.
Grade: B. Using your cellphone is awfully cool, and this service is great when you hear about something worth watching while you’re traveling. But Verizon charges $2 a month for this, whereas you can perform the same stunt (programming the TiVo remotely) free at TiVo.com or tv.yahoo.com/tivo. 
TIVOCAST TiVo can now auto-record Web videos from CNET, The New York Times, Rocketboom, The Onion and other sources just the way it records TV shows, and play them in TV-screen dimensions. (My own weekly videos are among the offerings.)
Grade: A. These videos look and sound fantastic on the big screen. And the whole concept makes overwhelming sense; why should all the fun and information of Web videos be confined to a stuttering, low-resolution, three-inch rectangle in your Web browser? More, more!
AMAZON MOVIES Amazon.com offers movie downloads, either for rental (usually $4) or for purchase (usually $16). Most people who use this service, called Unbox, download the movies to their computers. But now you can request that your Unbox movies arrive directly on the TiVo.
Grade: B. The movie selection is small, you don’t get the DVD extras, and most of the rental movies erase themselves 24 hours after you start watching them. 
But the video quality is excellent, and using your Web browser to order a movie is a lot more efficient than, say, clunking through the pay-per-view list on your TV set. As more movies come online, this technology could bring us one step closer to our inevitable “any movie, any time” future.
 WEATHER AND TRAFFIC With two clicks of the remote, you can fill your TV screen with the local five-day forecast or the current conditions on your commute (“Lane Closed on I-271 northbound at Exit 23 until 7 p.m.”). 
Grade: A+. The service is fantastic, full-featured and free (although you have to sign up for a free Yahoo account).
MOVIE LISTINGS Two clicks bring you a list of movies playing locally, complete with show times and other information; you can even buy tickets right from the TiVo. 
Grade: A–. You can get similar information from many other sources — MovieFone, Web sites, the newspaper — but TiVo’s presentation is cleaner, faster and totally unsullied by ads. You’re supposed to be able to buy tickets through the TiVo, too, but not all theaters offer this feature. 
INTERNET RADIO TiVo can play any of hundreds of Internet radio stations, neatly organized by type of music (or talk) and ready to play with high fidelity. Your TV screen isn’t wasted, either; most stations display performer information and album art.
Grade: B. Sometimes the music is strong and clear, and sometimes there are flickering dropouts. A few stations don’t play because they’re “sold out,” whatever that means.
PODCASTS As simple as can be: use the neatly categorized list (News, Music, Tech, and so on) of the Internet’s best podcasts (NPR, CBS News, PBS, Time and so on) or type in the address of your own quirky favorite. Listen while you make breakfast. 
Grade: A. No ads, no clutter, no effort — just a direct line to the best audio on the Net, even when your computer is turned off. 
GURU GUIDE At your option, the TiVo can auto-record several hours a week of TV shows recommended by experts like the Parents TV Council, Sports Illustrated, CNET and so on.
Grade: C–. The concept is sound, but the reality is baffling. What does the Parents TV Council recommend for your children? Game shows (“Wheel of Fortune,” “Deal or No Deal”) and sassy sitcoms (“Kim Possible,” “Hannah Montana”). The council evidently objects only to bad language, not bad TV.
Meanwhile, CNET’s technology recommendations include “American Idol,” “Heroes” and “New York Mets @ St. Louis Cardinals” (huh?).
In short, either the gurus or their recommendations need a rethink.
MUSIC AND PHOTOS The much-hyped Apple TV is a set-top box that brings your computer’s music, photos and videos on the TV screen, wirelessly. But the TiVo does exactly the same thing, and it’s already hooked up to your TV.
Grade: B. Copy-protected music and videos don’t play, and the software is bare bones. 
THE BOTTOM LINE This Internet stuff is a lot of icing on an already delicious cake, and more is coming. 
Not all of it will appeal to the masses or people who just want to watch “Saturday Night Live” on Sunday morning. And these enhancements make a TiVo fan’s attempts to explain, in a nutshell, what the TiVo is an even more hopeless task.
But if TiVo’s aim was to differentiate itself, it’s been successful. As you’ve probably noticed, not everything worth watching these days originates on TV. But thanks to these unheralded and unadvertised improvements, the TiVo is the first set-top box to present all the good stuff on a single screen — the one across from your couch.
ATLANTIC CITY, New Jersey — Two of the three casinos here that bear his name rank at the bottom in terms of gambling revenue among the 11 casinos in town. And in an industry that sometimes seems like a legal means of printing money, his casino holding company lost $19 million last year - in no small part because it is carrying a staggering $1.4 billion in debt.
And yet Donald Trump, being Donald Trump, cannot help exclaiming how astonishingly well his three casinos are faring.
"I'm happy to say we're doing very, very well," Trump said by phone after finishing a round of golf at the Augusta National Golf Club in Georgia, home of the Masters tournament. "I couldn't be happier with how things are going."
Is it any wonder, then, that it has fallen upon rivals to express sympathy on behalf of Trump and the management that has been running Trump Entertainment Resorts since the company emerged from bankruptcy in 2005?
While the Trump Taj Mahal is a solid performer, casino operators here forlornly shake their heads when talking about the general plight of Trump's casinos. This comes at a time when overall gambling revenues here are sliding because of competition from the slot parlors that have recently opened in New York and Philadelphia.
To retain its status as a major gambling hub, most officials say, Atlantic City must offer something more closely resembling a Las Vegas experience, where free-spending tourists looking for several nights of fun and fine food are king, rather than day-tripping, coupon-carrying retirees watching their quarters.
But more than one casino executive questioned privately whether the three Trump gambling properties, which are owned by Trump Entertainment Resorts and have suffered years of neglect because of drawn-out financial problems, have the cash necessary to compete in the new Atlantic City.
The gambling professionals responsible for running the Trump properties do not entirely disagree.
"Most casino companies tend to be awash in cash, but we are not," said Mark Juliano, the chief operating officer. "As a result, reinvestment was not done until fairly recently, causing the hotels to become somewhat less competitive from a facilities point of view. But we're starting to turn that around. "In some ways," he added, "we're 10 years behind."
Speculation over the fate of the Trump casinos has heightened since mid-March, when the company revealed that it had hired the investment banking firm Merrill Lynch to "explore all our options," as Trump put it. That includes the possibility that the company might sell all three properties - or perhaps dispose of a single hotel to raise the capital to improve the other two. Trump owns just over 30 percent of Trump Entertainment, a publicly traded stock.
Trump Entertainment has spent roughly $140 million over the last 18 months sprucing up its three properties - and plans to spend $110 million in the coming year and a half. But that investment falls short in the new Atlantic City, where the Borgata, the town's newest and most successful casino-hotel, recently spent $200 million on an expansion of its gambling floor. Meanwhile, the Showboat spent nearly $100 million just to add a House of Blues nightclub.
For all his current troubles, Trump holds a storied spot in the brief history of gambling in Atlantic City. Four new casinos opened here from 1980 to 2003. Three were Trump's.
"Trump really stuck it out in the 1980s, when no one else seemed to want to invest here," said Joseph Weinert, an analyst with the Spectrum Gaming Group here.
Yet Trump's Atlantic City ambitions came at a heavy price. Opening three casinos in 10 years saddled Trump with enormous debts, which have hampered the Trump properties in recent years.
Trump made his name building luxurious, outsized properties that permit people to live his version of the fantasy life, but without deep reserves of cash he has been unable to keep pace with the Atlantic City competitors who are out-Trumping Trump in the battle for those seeking a few days of pampered, prince-and-princess-like pleasures. "New places came to Atlantic City like the Borgata and revolutionized the market," said Joel Simkins, a casino analyst with the Prudential Equity Group. "But Trump's debt meant they weren't able to keep up."
To contend with the company's crushing debt, Trump sold shares in his casinos in a pair of public offerings during the mid-1990s. But that move only forestalled the inevitable, analysts said. In 2004, Trump Hotels and Casino Resorts filed for bankruptcy court protection.
The company exited bankruptcy the next year with a new corporate name and new management team. Trump stepped aside as chief executive (he retains the chairman's title) and was succeeded by James Perry. Perry and Juliano, the chief operating officer, who started at around that same time, have nearly six decades in the casino business between them.
"These properties are not earning what they could or should be earning," said Adam Steinberg, an analyst with Morgan Joseph, an investment banking firm. "But the good news here is that Trump finally has a strong management team in there that knows what it's doing and can say to him, 'No, you're wrong, here's what we need to do.'?"
Some of the early efforts by the new Trump team boil down to upgrades that resemble those initiated by rival casinos a decade earlier. That includes technology that permits the company to shift pricing of its hotel rooms based on a constantly changing snapshot of supply and demand and an integrated "players card" that allows visitors to earn points on money they spend at any of the company's three casino hotels.
Trump Entertainment is also in the middle of an upgrade of a different sort as it tries to rely less on the bus traffic that has proven its mainstay since the 1980s and more on vacation travelers as well as businesses and conventions looking for entertaining locales for meetings.
"What we've been doing in the 18 months since I've been here," Perry said, "is repositioning our properties so they are more dedicated to people who are going to stay the night in one of our hotel rooms and rely less on the day-trippers market."
Trump Entertainment is cutting back on the "comps," or freebies, it offers low-end players to persuade them to visit their casinos. "We're not talking about eliminating our bus traffic," Juliano said. "But we are deliberately not interested in that low-end customer solely driven by comps. We've decided he doesn't add much value."To make its properties more inviting to a higher-end customer, Trump Entertainment is in the midst of spending $250 million "refreshing our product," Perry said. That includes the installation of hundreds of new slot machines at each of the three properties - an improvement Juliano described as "long overdue" - and a makeover of every room the company operates, including the kind of over-the-top suites for high rollers that have become standard fare in both Las Vegas and Atlantic City. Much of that spending is taking place at the Trump Taj Mahal, the largest and most successful of the Trump holdings. The casino floor at the Taj Mahal, which ranked fourth among Atlantic City's 11 properties in terms of gambling revenues generated through the first two months of 2007, is now in the midst of a floor-to-ceiling makeover that "will mean we have a property that rivals any other casino floor in Atlantic City," Juliano said.
Trump Entertainment is spending another $250 million building a new 800-room tower at the Taj.
To help raise the cash needed to pay for physical upgrades, the company recently sold its one non-Atlantic City casino, the Trump Indiana Casino Hotel in Gary, Indiana, for $227 million.
It is possible that Trump Entertainment might sell another of its casinos to buy down its debt and pay for further property improvements. But analysts do not think a sale is necessary or likely. A more plausible scenario, analysts agreed, is that Merrill Lynch helps the company refinance its debt, which Trump said was costing it 8.5 percent in interest expenses. "For a junk bond casino," he said, that "is very reasonable."
Still, all three Trump properties offer prime locales in a city where available casino land sells at a steep premium, and so there is always a chance a rival might want to snap up part or all of a company with a market capitalization of only about $550 million.
The prospect, unlikely as it may be, of an Atlantic City with no Trump-branded casino prompted Trump to feel nostalgic. A day after his initial interview, he phoned back from the Beverly Hills Hotel. "You got me thinking," he said. "Would Atlantic City be the same without me? I think the answer would be no."

“You’ve got casinos here spending like mad to remake themselves and go up-market,” said the general manager at one rival property, who spoke only if his name was not disclosed because he was critiquing competitors. “And you’ve got casinos with their heads in the sand who aren’t doing much of anything.”
And then there’s the Trump Plaza, Trump Marina and Trump Taj Mahal, which he said occupy a third category by themselves. “You almost have to feel sorry for them,” this executive said. “They’re trying, but you have to wonder if they can pull it off.”
 Trump Entertainment has spent roughly $140 million over the last 18 months sprucing up its three properties — and plans to spend another $110 million in the coming year and a half.

“You got me thinking,” he said. “Would Atlantic City be the same without me? I think the answer would be no.”
They say that things come in threes. If so, I know what will arrive soon: another deal where a good player finds a line of play that works even though the breaks are bad and gains points over someone who unwisely assumes that everything will be for the best in the best of all possible worlds — as in both Saturday’s column and today’s.
 The diagramed deal occurred during a Swiss Team tournament on Tuesday at the Cincinnati Bridge Center.
 This auction, in which North’s passed-hand two-club response looks like Drury, showing at least three-card heart support and a maximum pass, was actually all-natural.
 If the missing trumps are 3-2, there are 10 easy tricks: two spades, four hearts, two diamonds, one club and a spade ruff on the board. And in the other room the declarer, also in four hearts after an uncontested auction, made that assumption. He won the spade lead in his hand, took his other top spade, ruffed his third spade on the board, cashed dummy’s heart king, then — fatally — led a trump to his ace. With the bad red-suit splits, he lost two hearts and two diamonds.
 The successful declarer was Pamela Granovetter of Cincinnati, who publishes Bridge Today magazine with her husband, Matthew. Deciding that she could wait to touch trumps, she won with her spade ace, led a diamond to dummy’s king and played another diamond.
 East probably should have discarded, and if he had, declarer planned to win with her diamond ace, cash the spade king, ruff her last spade on the board, take the club ace and exit with dummy’s last diamond, which would have brought home the contract.
 But East took the opportunity to score his singleton heart. Then he returned a spade. South won with her king, ruffed her last spade on the board and called for dummy’s remaining diamond. When East discarded without thought, declarer assumed he had started with two red-suit singletons. She won with her diamond ace, ruffed her last diamond with dummy’s heart ten, cashed the heart king and club ace, then ruffed a club in her hand. West overruffed but could take only one more trump trick. South had held her losers to three hearts.
 It was the old story that if the opponents’ trumps are splitting 4-1 or 5-0, declarer usually does best not to touch that suit early in the play.
 Plus 100 and plus 620 gave 12 international match points to Granovetter and her teammates, Gail Arnow, Karen Grosser and Matthew Granovetter of Cincinnati. They finished second behind Harriet Spiegel, Ed Lee, Frank Lichtenberger and Nathaniel Reid of Cincinnati.
SACRAMENTO, April 29 (AP)  Donald Trump gave $10,000 to Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger of California to help pay off campaign debts a little more than a month after Mr. Schwarzenegger appeared as a guest star on Mr. Trump’s television program “The Apprentice: Los Angeles,” according to a campaign filing.
In an episode broadcast on March 18, Mr. Schwarzenegger played host to five of the show’s contestants in his private conference room at the Capitol here.
The governor denies any link between the donation and the television appearance, but some political watchdog groups are skeptical.
“He’s clearly using his personal friendships and his celebrity to pay off his campaign debt, and that’s just wrong,” said Jamie Court, president of the Foundation for Taxpayer and Consumer Rights, a group that tracks campaign donations.
A Schwarzenegger spokeswoman, Julie Soderlund, said the April 20 donation was not connected to the governor’s appearance on the program. The taping took place earlier in the year, but Ms. Soderlund was unsure of the date.
Mr. Trump could not be reached for comment at his company’s headquarters in New York.
The donation was Mr. Trump’s first to Mr. Schwarzenegger, whom he described as a great friend when he told a group of contestants that they would meet him as a reward for winning a competition. 
 The libbers for lob equality once risked their wood Wilsons so prize purses for women would mean more than a nice clutch bag, so gender equity would include the right to a shared pot.
 Amid the estrogen revolution, the women’s Tour evolved ahead of society as Billie Jean King made feminism cool, as Martina Navratilova made muscle acceptable, as Chris Evert made an empire out of a playing career.
 They were Oprah before Oprah. They were tennis stars who, in their own ways, nurtured the Tour so well, with such a progressive spirit, it is the only women’s league where the money measures up to the fellas.
 But what happens to the Tour when financial freedom opens an escape hatch?
 At age 23, Kim Clijsters doesn’t need tennis anymore. She doesn’t need waking up with an aching body after another night spent away from her fiancé, in a hotel room that looks exactly like the last.
 Ranked No. 5 on the WTA Tour, with $14.7 million in career earnings, plus millions more in endorsements, Clijsters chose to retire on Sunday, with an explanation straight off the menu of the “Happy Days” diner. 
 “Right now, it is time for a new life,” Clijsters wrote on her Web site. “Time for marrying. Children? Time for cooking and playing with the dogs.”
 She would be a lousy bra burner. But Clijsters’s decision to opt out of the playing tedium is not an aberration these days; it is a Tour trend. Some high-ranked players have retired — like Clijsters and Lindsay Davenport — while stars from Justine Henin to Amélie Mauresmo, from Martina Hingis to Venus Williams, have alternately disappeared during their careers in a game of “Where’s Waldo?”
 Injuries, players claim. Lame excuses, the suspicious say. 
 But what women’s tennis may reveal is the same socially sanctioned element that ribbons through every Starbucks, where mommies with M.B.A.’s prefer to run play dates instead of boardroom meetings. In this circle, it’s O.K. to jump off the fast track for the mommy track or laugh track. Whatever makes a woman of means happy. 
 Money hasn’t fueled the competition in women’s tennis. It has served as a disincentive to play when the ladies reach a point where they have earned enough to buy contentment.
 “Money is important, but not the most important in my life,” Clijsters wrote in her online diary. “Health and happiness are so much more key to life.”
 This is the right philosophy, isn’t it? And yet, one woman’s Zen is another loss for the Tour. Tournaments and majors played without longtime rivals or a consistency of stardom or familiar faces puts women’s tennis at risk of vanishing through irrelevance. 
Top players on Tour can afford to be ladies of leisure as they parachute in and out of the schedule to indulge in their cultural gender differences with male athletes.
 Salary figures and contract numbers define many male pros. To them, wealth is a measure of their self-worth. This is why Roger Clemens needed to be the most ridiculously paid player in the game upon his ego-gratifying return. This is why LeBron James writes down “becoming a billionaire” on his career to-do list, why draft picks hold out, why free agents leave teams, why Tiger Woods has the same goal as James.
•
 Money as a reflection of manhood is not a hard and fast rule. There are exceptions. Bjorn Borg retired early after growing weary of the Tour grind and privacy intrusions. But disillusionment on the women’s Tour is a flu bug passing from one star to the next.
 In tennis, 23 is the new 40. It’s midlife crisis time when players start to ponder the loneliness of the Tour, develop outside interests and realize they have been at the game since age 10, maybe 6. The guys start the game later and enter the scene with less attention. The women experience their first pimple, first love and first breakup, all before the public. 
 The scrutiny is endless: Is Serena Williams’s caboose on the loose? Was Jennifer Capriati’s mood too dark? Did Hingis break Sergio García’s heart? Just what did the effervescent Clijsters once see in the boorish Lleyton Hewitt?
The constant prying is enough to make a gal run for the exit. 
 “No more gossip or lies in the newspapers,” Clijsters explained.
 Mental burnout is nothing new to tennis (as in Andrea Jaeger at age 19) and careers have been cut short by injury before (as in Tracy Austin at 20). Clijsters cited herself as a victim of both. She longed for more time to plan her July wedding to Brian Lynch, an American-born basketball player in Europe. She pined for the days when she could slide on the court into a full split — a trademark of her Silly Putty elasticity — without her back locking up.

 Tennis has a history of devouring its youth. But never have so many stars seemed so eager to fade out, whether into retirement or an extended leave.
 There is no glass ceiling on the women’s Tour — the revolutionists in pleated skirts made sure of it — but there is an open window. Who knew liberation could one day threaten the Tour?
The fifth and final session of the Cavendish Invitational Pairs, which took place last Sunday in Henderson, Nev., turned into a close race. The Norwegians Geir Helgemo and Tor Helness had led after the fourth session but suffered a couple of disasters and dropped to fifth. The Americans Bobby Levin of New York City and Steve Weinstein of Andes, N.Y., who had been in front after the second session, moved up steadily on the rail, putting their noses in front near the end and holding off the challengers. Second were Drew Casen and Mike Passell of Las Vegas, with Bruce Rogoff of Upper Grandview, N.Y., and Louk Verhees from the Netherlands third.
 The entry fee for each of the 56 pairs was $2,500. Before play began there was an auction: Each pair was sold to a backer or group of backers, the minimum bid being $12,500. The pundits were correct because Levin and Weinstein were “sold” for the largest sum, $47,000, a thousand dollars more than the Norwegians. The auction raised $1,180,000, which went to the backers of the top 10 finishers. But to give all pairs something to play for, the entry fees were returned as session prizes.
 The diagramed deal was Board 15 of the second session.
 After Levin (South) opened one club, Weinstein responded one heart. Some players bid one diamond and played in that suit. We will look at six diamonds in a moment.
 Levin rebid two clubs, preferring that to one no-trump. Weinstein’s next bid, four diamonds, was Roman Key Card Blackwood in clubs. Especially when you plan to play in clubs, asking for aces or key cards with four no-trump leaves you badly placed, almost certain to have to bid a slam. Asking with the suit above the agreed suit (called Kickback) fixes that problem.
 Levin’s four no-trump showed two key cards (one ace and the trump king, or two aces) but denied the trump queen.
 Five diamonds announced that all the aces and the club king were held and asked for other kings, five spades showing that king and denying the heart king. (Even if you use regular Blackwood, not Key Card, when you have an agreed trump suit, showing specific kings is a better idea than saying how many kings you have.)
 Weinstein settled for six no-trump.
 Declarer won the heart lead on the board and cashed the club ace, East’s discard telling South that six clubs was doomed.
 West was holding clubs over declarer, and East seemed to have hearts over the dummy. This meant that a squeeze would not work. Instead South relied on the spade finesse. When that worked, he conceded only one club trick, collecting three spades, two hearts, four diamonds and three clubs for plus 990.
 There were 28 results. Eight times North-South lost 100; 14 times they went minus 50; thrice they were plus 990; and three times they were plus 920.
 Plus 920? Yes, six diamonds can be made despite the bad splits. The pairs to achieve this were Christal Henner-Welland of New York City and Michael Rosenberg of New Rochelle, N.Y.; Jens Auken and Soren Christiansen from Denmark; and Jie Zhao and Fu Zhong from China.
 East is likely to lead a trump against six diamonds. Declarer (North) wins in his hand and tries to cash the club ace, but East ruffs and plays another trump. Declarer takes that, cashes his top hearts, ruffs a heart in the dummy, plays a spade to his jack, ruffs his last heart, returns to hand with a spade to the ace and draws East’s remaining trumps. Dummy’s black kings take the last two tricks. Declarer wins three spades, two hearts, four diamonds, one club and two heart ruffs in the dummy.
 This is the third Cavendish Pairs win for Levin and Weinstein in the last nine years, and Weinstein won twice before that with Fred Stewart — an amazing record.
CHICAGO, May 24 — It was a jarring sight for those going about their business in the low-key bustle of downtown on Thursday: Donald J. Trump, the New York developer, and his glamorous grown children stepping off Michigan Avenue surrounded by a swirling sea of camera crews he had summoned.
For some, the visit and all its staged hoopla felt as unlikely in this city as Mr. Trump’s gleaming $850 million, 1,392-foot tall hotel and condominium tower, which has shot out of the ground in recent months complete with banners proclaiming his name along the edge of the Chicago River. 
Noting that Chicago’s housing market was struggling, Mr. Trump said he had come to town to make sure people knew there were still units available in the building, which will open in phases beginning with the hotel in December. “We want to give people really good deals,” he said, as gusts of wind buffeted his trademark hair.
Many here had doubted that Mr. Trump would ever pull off his first foray in a city that prizes equally the architectural significance of its skyline and the down-to-earth nature of its personalities. There were early questions about financing, and smirks about the fanfare of Mr. Trump’s announcement a few years back that a winner on his hit television show, “The Apprentice,” would be the project’s manager. 
But not far from the famed Wrigley Building and the Tribune Tower, on a spot where the dumpy 7-story Sun-Times building once squatted, it undeniably was here: 29 floors so far, 63 more to go and a crowd of men in hard hats climbing cranes and bulldozing even as the cameras rolled. 
Still, there are signs that Mr. Trump’s sense of luxury (11 spa rooms, what he promises will a “world-class signature restaurant,” a grand ballroom, an enormous swimming pool overlooking the river) may be a tad more luxurious than some here are willing to pay for. 
People have committed to buy 601 of the planned 825 hotel and residential units, said Tere Proctor, sales director for the Trump International Hotel and Tower. But sales have slowed in recent months. Since January, only about eight have sold, Ms. Proctor acknowledged. 
 Prices range from $580,000 to more than $9 million, and local real estate brokers said some of the prices per square foot were striking buyers as more fitting for a city several hundred miles east of Chicago.
Mr. Trump’s tower has also struggled some on the publicity front. Another proposed tower — this one a twisting spire intended to be 2,000-feet tall and designed by the Spanish architect Santiago Calatrava — has grabbed the spotlight in recent months, in part because it would be the tallest in the nation. 
Mr. Trump, who had once suggested that his Chicago tower would be the tallest building in the world, on Thursday dismissed the “Chicago Spire” plan as “impractical” and said he would not want to build such a tall building anyway because buyers did not want to be terrorism targets. 
Most people ignored the fuss as they walked by the news conference, but some pondered what so many changes ahead might mean for the city’s skyline. Doug Strubel, 43, politely offered the thought that Mr. Trump’s building might be in step with the style of some of the city’s sleeker works by Ludwig Mies van der Rohe.
“Well, it’s shiny,” Mr. Strubel said, gazing over at the building. Then, as an afterthought, he added, “I guess this is what a television game show gets you.”
 For churning up long-lost files, dusty tchotchkes and fading personal memories, nothing beats packing up your belongings for a big move.
So I was reminded recently as I sorted through books, papers, photographs and other debris accumulated over more than two decades of working at this newspaper’s West 43rd Street office in Manhattan. The editorial board’s departure for The Times’s brand new headquarters two blocks away, on Eighth Avenue, was just days away.
What should have been a two- to three-hour packing job, max, turned into a daylong sentimental journey as I communed with some of the old items I unearthed, trying to decide whether to toss them into one of the bright orange crates coming with me to the new digs. In addition to lingering over grade-school pictures of my children, I hereby confess to spending more than an hour perusing the contents of three thick, red accordion-style folders bulging with yellowed newspaper clippings and other material pertaining to a string of editorials I had collaborated on starting back in the mid-1980s. These editorials called, unsuccessfully, for the repeal of a costly New York boondoggle known as the Wicks Law.
Ah, yes, the Wicks Law. Enacted in 1921, and subsequently named for a state senator from upstate, Arthur Wicks, this arcane statute requires local governments undertaking new building projects or renovations costing more than $50,000 to hire four separate contractors by low bid  for general construction, plumbing, electrical and heating and ventilation work  rather than retaining a single general contractor who hires and supervises all subcontractors.
 Although originally intended to increase competition and reduce construction costs, the law actually does the opposite, saddling localities with coordination duties for which they lack personnel and expertise, and promulgating conflicts and delays that scare off responsible bidders, and foster shoddy work and litigation. In all, studies have found, the Wicks Law can add anywhere from 10 percent to 30 percent to the cost of building a fire station, school building or other public projects. Yet, sporadic efforts over the years by governors of both parties to persuade the State Legislature to end, or at least lessen the law’s costly burden, have been met with only minimal success, thanks to tenacious opposition by the plumbers, electricians and other influential craft unions.
 I think of the Wicks Law as the ridiculous state mandate that helped make Donald Trump something of an urban hero. This was in 1986, long before “The Apprentice.”
At the time, the city had bungled the job of renovating Central Park’s Wollman Rink for six years, largely owing to coordination and quality problems traceable to the senseless multiple contracting requirement. The city said it would need another two years to correct the mistakes and complete the job. 
Enter Mr. Trump. In an act of civic generosity and ingenious public relations  and to the eternal annoyance of Mayor Edward Koch  the real estate developer offered to take over. He completed the job in just five months, easily in time for the next winter skating season. That was a major coup Mr. Trump triumphantly detailed the next year in his book, “Trump: The Art of the Deal.”
I decided against hauling the book to the new office, but my files on the Wicks Law were a different matter. Suddenly, the issue is current again, with Gov. Eliot Spitzer pushing hard for reform legislation that would exempt localities outside of New York City from having to seek separate contracts for public works costing less than $1 million. The new threshold for New York City projects would be $2 million, except for new school construction, which won an exemption, since extended, in 1988. His measure also includes provisions to ensure fair treatment and compensation of subcontractors, and to expand the use of so-called project labor agreements, and the ability of localities to make one general contractor responsible for a job.
 Mr. Spitzer’s proposal stops short of repealing the Wicks Law, which is what should happen. But as his immediate predecessors, George Pataki and Mario Cuomo, discovered, winning any relief from the arcane contracting rules is tough.
 The little girl escorting her little brother to school in one of my office photos graduated from college two weeks ago. My son starts college in September. When it comes to the Wicks Law, not much has changed. Not yet.
CHICAGO, June 4 — In Canada, at least, the criminal fraud case of Conrad M. Black was billed as “the trial of the century” as it began more than two months ago.
Accusations that Mr. Black and three colleagues had looted more than $60 million from the international newspaper conglomerate that he built promised to put not just Mr. Black’s oversize ego and life on display, but also a frothy brew of high finance, high society and high intrigue. 
But a decision over the weekend by Mr. Black’s defense lawyers not to call as a witness Donald J. Trump, underscored that Mr. Black’s trial has been at times a colorful, but mostly muted and sometimes tedious affair.
Indeed, Mr. Black’s defense is expected to wrap up later this week after only a handful of witnesses, none of them the bold-face figures Mr. Black was known for associating with when he built one of the world’s largest newspaper companies, Hollinger International. 
Mr. Trump would have been just such a witness. He had been expected to bolster the defense argument that a surprise party that Mr. Black gave for the 60th birthday of his wife, Barbara Amiel, in December 2000 was a business, rather than a social event. Mr. Black charged two-thirds of the $62,000 for the party at La Grenouille in New York to Hollinger International, where he was chairman and chief executive and where Ms. Amiel was a director and its vice president for editorial. 
Mr. Trump was expected to argue that he considered the event a business function because he was in the midst of negotiating a possible joint venture with Mr. Black’s company to develop the headquarters of The Chicago Sun-Times, which Hollinger owned, into a residential and hotel tower. Other attendees have testified that they believed the party was a personal, not corporate, function. 
Mr. Trump said yesterday that he had been subpoenaed and planned to travel to Chicago but was told on Saturday that he would not be called to the stand. Mr. Black’s lawyer, Edward Greenspan, confirmed that Mr. Trump was no longer on his witness list, but declined to say why. 
Mr. Trump declined to comment on his role in the case or what he would have testified but said he was pleased to be in New York with a clear calendar. “I’ve caught up on all sort of stuff,” he said in a telephone interview. “I have a free day — I haven’t had one of these days in a long time.” 
Two people close to Mr. Black’s defense lawyers said that the decision not to have Mr. Trump testify was based on their perception that the case was going well for them and that the prosecution had failed to deliver a smoking gun through 27 witnesses over 43 days. (This also makes it unlikely that Mr. Black will testify in his defense.) 
Since the trial began on March 14, the jury has been asked to understand complex corporate structures, tax issues and financial practices, which has led to some numbing stretches. But jurors have perked up whenever prosecutors have tried — as they did yesterday — to illustrate that Mr. Black was using the company to fund his lavish lifestyle. 
One charge against him is that Mr. Black bought a Park Avenue apartment back from the company on unfair terms. A tax specialist testified that Mr. Black had spent $4.6 million on improvements while occupied it, justifying the $3 million price he paid for the apartment in 2000. 
But an assistant United States attorney, Eric Sussman, then ran through numerous bills for furnishings and improvements, suggesting that at least a portion of the $4.6 million was spent on personal possessions that Mr. Black took when he sold the apartment in 2005 for $10 million. 
The jury paid close attention when Mr. Sussman ran through items like a $17,000 sound system and $9,000 diamond safe, “Indian white marble reliefs of elephants” (purchased for $17,710), painted rectangular stools in the Louis XVI style ($9,800), a “Swedish figured birch 3-drawer commode with fossilized marble top” ($12,000), $350,000 for three carpets, a $12,500 mahogany shaving stand that was used by Napoleon during his campaign in Russia. 
Defense lawyers have previously argued unsuccessfully for a mistrial on the basis that as a wealthy individual Mr. Black cannot be assured a fair trial. Mr. Sussman repeatedly reminded the jury on Monday that according to securities filings, Mr. Black and the company agreed that the apartment would be kept in an “appropriately habitable condition for the uses contemplated.” 
 Meanwhile, people with knowledge of the decision not to call Mr. Trump, who asked not to be identified because they were not authorized to speak publicly for the defense, said Mr. Black’s lawyers were concerned that a circus atmosphere around Mr. Trump’s presence could work against their client. 
 After all, Mr. Black invited Mr. Trump to speak at a shareholders’ meeting of Hollinger International in the spring of 2003 at a time when investors were agitating about payments to company executives and to Canadian holding companies he and associates controlled. 
Prosecutors two weeks ago introduced a note from Mr. Black to Mr. Trump in which he writes “Dear Donald, Could I ask a rather esoteric favor?” Mr. Black goes on to ask Mr. Trump, who was not a shareholder, to “put in a cameo appearance and say a supportive word” at the meeting because “I’m sure it would have an impact on the group and be favorably noted in the press.” 
At that shareholder meeting, Mr. Trump praised Mr. Black and his former partner, F. David Radler, but both were eventually ejected from the company they built after an internal investigation raised questions about the payments that are now the subject of the criminal trial. 
In addition to the prospect of Mr. Trump being cross-examined about the 2003 shareholder meeting, there was concern that Mr. Black would attempt to exchange pleasantries with Mr. Trump in court, as he did last week with Kenneth Whyte, a witness for him who used to work for him as an editor in Canada. Mr. Black’s lawyers cut him off. 
A few days earlier, they had promised Judge Amy St. Eve that they would curb Mr. Black from expressing his strong views on the trial outside the courtroom, something he had been doing throughout the trial — including while granting interviews for a new biography on Richard M. Nixon that he has written. Among other things, Mr. Black had been quoted in various interviews in Canada and Britain saying he was “at war” with the United States for its persecution of him, and described the prosecutors in the Northern District of Illinois as “Nazis” whose case is “hanging like a toilet seat around their necks.” 
After the testimony of Mr. Radler, who is the only Hollinger International executive to have pleaded guilty to a single fraud count in exchange for the promise of lenience, Mr. Black told reporters outside the courtroom that “I don’t think any jury in the world would convict anybody on the basis of what he said.”
Despite his court-imposed restraint, the florid Mr. Black could be overheard during a break in the case on Monday quietly saying in the hallway that most of the prosecution’s witnesses had “left the courtroom in an eye dropper” after being cross-examined by his lawyers.
Raina Dawn Dieterle, the daughter of Donna and Richard Dieterle of New City, N.Y., was married last evening to Christopher Hollister Trump-Retchin, the son of Blaine Trump of Manhattan and the late Peter Retchin, who lived in Phoenix. The Very Rev. Frederick B. Northup, the former dean of St. Mark’s Episcopal Cathedral in Seattle, officiated at Marble House in Newport, R.I.
Mrs. Trump-Retchin, 29, is the photography editor at Quick & Simple, a Hearst weekly magazine in Manhattan. She graduated from the University of Colorado. 
The bride’s father works in Astoria, Queens, as the vice president and managing director of Spectrum on Broadway, an electrical sign and lighting maintenance company. Her mother, who is retired, worked in Manhattan as a senior vice president at Wachovia Bank, responsible for branch management in the New York City area. She is on the board of Eva’s Village, a nonprofit social services agency in Paterson, N.J.
Mr. Trump-Retchin, also 29, is a client manager in Manhattan at Quinlan Private, a Dublin real estate investment firm, specializing in properties in Central and Eastern Europe. He is the stepson of Betsy Ross-Retchin and of Robert S. Trump.
The bridegroom’s mother is a fund-raiser and vice chairwoman of God’s Love We Deliver, a trustee of American Ballet Theater and a member of the sustaining board of the Society of Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, all in Manhattan. His father was an owner of R&R Property Management, a home associations management company in Phoenix, which he founded with Ms. Ross-Retchin, who is now its president.
The bridegroom’s stepfather is the president of Trump Management in Brooklyn, a property management company. He was until 1991 the executive vice president of the Trump Organization, which is owned by Donald J. Trump, his brother.
You won’t see these stories on television, but Marian Wright Edelman and Dr. Irwin Redlener could talk to you all day and all night about children whose lives have been lost or ruined because they didn’t have health insurance.
This is not a situation one associates with a so-called advanced country. That you can have sick children wasting away in the United States, the wealthiest nation on the planet, because medical treatment that could relieve their suffering is withheld by men and women with dollar signs instead of compassion in their eyes is beyond unconscionable.
Ms. Edelman is the president of the Children’s Defense Fund, and Dr. Redlener is president of the Children’s Health Fund. 
Both are appalled at the embarrassing fact that nine million American children have no health coverage at all. Among them are children with diabetes, chronic asthma, heart conditions, life-threatening allergies and so on. In many instances they are left untreated until it is too late.
Leaving children uninsured is a form of Russian roulette, Dr. Redlener said.
“All children should be covered,” said Ms. Edelman.
Congress and the president could do something about this right now. Of the nine million children without coverage, six million are already eligible for either Medicaid or the popular State Children’s Health Insurance Program, or S-chip, which covers children whose parents earn too much to qualify for Medicaid but too little to afford private health insurance. The bulk of the funding for S-chip comes from the federal government.
S-chip, which had strong bipartisan support when it was established 10 years ago, is currently up for reauthorization in Congress. The program should be expanded as part of a broader effort to cover as many of the six million eligible-but-uninsured kids as possible.
Eligible children remain outside of S-chip and Medicaid for a variety of reasons, including the following: because there is insufficient funding to cover them; because families do not realize their children qualify for coverage; because red tape and complicated regulations discourage families from signing up.
A number of S-chip re-authorization proposals are being developed. The best-case scenario would be legislation  costing as much as $50 billion in additional funding over the next five years  that would cover millions of additional youngsters from poor and working-poor families. This would put the U.S. on the road toward universal coverage for children.
Ten billion dollars a year is considered a pittance when it comes to funding wars and tax cuts for the very wealthy. But it’s suddenly a lot of money when the subject is the health of American children.
One of the worst scenarios has been offered by President Bush in his White House budget proposal. That calls for just $4.8 billion in new funding for S-chip over the next five years. The result, according to the Congressional Budget Office, would be a net loss of coverage for 1.4 million children.
The old expression was “taking candy from a baby.” The White House is ready to take away vitally needed medicine.
Negotiations over the reauthorization of S-chip are under way. It will be interesting to see whether the Democrats who crowed so much about their newfound power when they took control of Congress will stand tall for the kids of the poor and working poor, and whether there are enough caring Republicans to resurrect the spirit of bipartisanship from a decade ago.
As the heat gets turned up on this issue, the White House appears to be falling into its old habit of creating its own reality. 
The Congressional Budget Office and most researchers have agreed on the six million figure for the number of youngsters who are eligible for government-sponsored health coverage but remain unenrolled  roughly four million for Medicaid and two million for S-chip. This has not been controversial.
Yesterday, the Department of Health and Human Services began circulating a study that tries to make the case that the total number of eligible but uninsured youngsters is a mere 794,000, an absurdly low figure.
If you can wave a magic wand and make five million poor kids disappear, you no longer have to think about caring for them.
Advocates like Dr. Redlener and Ms. Edelman don’t have that luxury.
“Kids who grow up with poor access to health care carry a high risk of having underdiagnosed and undertreated chronic illness, both physical and emotional,” said Dr. Redlener. “We know what to do. We should fully fund this effort at the $50 billion level and make coverage mandatory for all children.” 
 First look at only the West hand in the diagramed deal. You are on lead against six spades. Declarer showed four spades, five diamonds and two key cards (one ace and the trump king, or two aces) but no trump queen. Dummy revealed five or more clubs, four spades and sufficient strength to drive to slam opposite a minimum opening bid. What would you lead?
 This deal was played on June 2 in the California Capital Swiss Teams in Sacramento.
 In traditional American bidding, South’s two-spade rebid, a reverse, would show extra values; usually at least 15 high-card points opposite a two-level response (and at least a good 17 if the responder has bid only at the one level). But North-South were playing that after a two-level response, which was game-forcing, a reverse defined only hand distribution, not strength.
 What is a reverse? In an uncontested auction, when the opener rebids in a new suit without a jump and the responder, if he wishes to support opener’s first-bid suit, must go to the three level, the opener has made a reverse.
 At the other table North-South made four spades with two overtricks, so there were a lot of international match points riding on the result in six spades.
 Sitting West was Bob Morris of Houston. With good minor-suit holdings, he sensibly decided to lead a trump. Holding only a doubleton, it is traditional to start with the lower card, and that was what Morris did, leading the spade deuce. Here, though, there was a case for selecting the ten, which would have made the defense much easier and ruined a good story.
 Sitting East was George Rosenkranz, Mexico’s top-ranked player and a member of the American Contract Bridge League’s Hall of Fame. When declarer called for dummy’s spade seven at Trick 1, most players would cover with the nine — and let the contract through.
 Declarer would win with his ace, play a club to dummy’s ace, ruff a club in his hand, lead a heart to the board, trump a second club (overruffing East if necessary), return to the board with a heart and ruff a third club. South would ruff his last heart with dummy’s spade eight, draw trumps and cash the two established clubs. He would lose only one diamond trick.
 But when East let declarer take the first trick with dummy’s spade seven, suddenly the tide turned. South cashed dummy’s club ace, ruffed a club in his hand, played a heart to the board and trumped another club, East discarding a heart. Back to dummy with a heart, declarer ruffed another club in his hand, while East threw his final heart. That left this end position:
[chart]
 South could not ruff his heart jack with dummy’s spade eight because East would overruff with his carefully conserved nine and shift to a diamond. Declarer did the best he could, leading the diamond king from his hand, hoping East would have to win with the ace. But West took the trick and led a heart, promoting East’s spade nine as the setting trick.
 When you see that declarer is likely to be doing a lot of ruffing, it might be best to retain your high spot-card in the trump suit, as Dr. Rosenkranz did here. Maybe it will be promoted later in the play.
 Trump Entertainment Resorts, the casino company founded by the real estate developer Donald J. Trump, said yesterday that it was unable to find a buyer after a three-month search, leading to the biggest drop in its share price in two years.
The offers the company received were not likely to lead to a transaction, it said yesterday. In March, Trump Entertainment hired Merrill Lynch to explore a sale. It held negotiations with a group of investors that included Dennis C. Gomes, a former gambling industry executive.
Mr. Trump has struggled to make money from his casinos. Three properties went bankrupt in the early 1990s. He led the company through nine years of losses and six months in bankruptcy protection before giving up the chief executive post in 2005.
“The assets are old and tired, and that’s the problem,” said Justin Sebastiano, an analyst at Nollenberger Capital Partners in San Francisco. As competitors upgrade, “it’s only going to get tougher for the rest of the year and into ’08,” he said.
Last year, Trump Entertainment tried to enter the Philadelphia casino market, but dropped the plans after failing to secure a Pennsylvania license.
Shares of Trump Entertainment, based in Atlantic City, fell $2.09, or 16.6 percent yesterday, to $10.49.
“We have a good company and we’re going to run the company,” Mr. Trump, its chairman, said. 
The company will now be run by Mark Juliano, who took over as acting chief executive on Sunday, succeeding James B. Perry, who left on June 18.
The company said it had fired Paul Keller, the head of design and construction, and the chief information officer, Virginia M. McDowell. The general counsel, Robert M. Pickus, 52, was named chief administrative officer pending approval by the New Jersey Casino Control Commission, Mr. Trump said in a regulatory filing.
“It’s probably on the right track,” said Eric Green, portfolio manager at Penn Capital Management in Cherry Hill, N.J., “but the question is whether Juliano can keep it in that direction.” 
Senator John McCain is eating humble political pie, having been able to raise a “mere” $24 million so far this year for his presidential campaign. That was a considerable amount in past campaigns, but so negligible in the hyper-dollar frenzy leading to 2008 that pundits find Mr. McCain’s Straight Talk Express heading for a cliff. Things are so grim that Mr. McCain is considering resorting to matching public funds — the once popular tax-assisted alternative that has been allowed to wither in recent years because of Congress’s fixation on the power of private campaign money. 
This is poignant, since Mr. McCain — the Senate’s leader in reforming campaign finances — had spurned matching funds at the beginning of this year when he started with expectations of being a front-runner capable of bagging unlimited amounts of private donations. That has not occurred. So now the senator is slashing his campaign staff and refashioning himself as a wannabe Comeback Kid aiming for an early, desperate upset of better-heeled rivals. And, to do that, he’s considering retreating to the shelter of matching funds for the few extra million it would offer in the short run.
Money is at a premium as more states reschedule primaries to earlier dates, creating more expensive, must-win arenas for the candidates to buy into. The first vox pop caucus activity does not occur until January in Iowa, where past candidates began clustering on Labor Day. This year’s bevy is working that turf today for the July Fourth crowds. 
Senator McCain and other candidates forced to penny-pinch would be having an easier time if the matching fund alternative had been updated for inflation. It worked well to open up politics for 30 years after it was enacted — after the Watergate scandal spot-lit the corruptive power of special-interest money. It served candidates in six presidential races, with three challengers managing to defeat incumbents. 
There’s more to politics than money, although that’s hard to grasp so far in the donation derby, paced by Senator Barack Obama’s eye-popping $55 million tote, much of it raised in the evolving world of Internet contributors. Among the reasons Senator McCain is losing the pre-election money race are undoubtedly the politics of his support for the Iraq war and his sponsorship of the failed immigration reform bill, which is unpopular in key states like Iowa. 
Whether he proves to be 2008’s Comeback Kid or its first footnote, Mr. McCain and his campaign already are of value to voters bewildered by the political priority of money over ideas. If there is to be any hope of reining in the money blitz, the nation must press Congress to resuscitate the matching funds alternative in time for 2012. 
Donald J. Trump, the man who wrote “The Art of the Deal,” failed to make a deal this week, and his casino company’s shareholders are suffering. Again.
Mr. Trump grew famous as a real estate developer, and some people still think that an apartment with his name is worth more than one without it. He became a television star in “The Apprentice,” where his main contribution was to say to contestants competing for the right to work for him, “You’re fired.”
That played on his strength, as was shown again this week when his casino company, Trump Entertainment, reported it had fired two executive vice presidents.
But when it comes to running operating businesses, he has been something less than a resounding success. The Plaza Hotel in Manhattan went bankrupt under his tutelage, and his casino empire has been under bankruptcy protection twice, in the early 1990s and again this decade.
Mr. Trump has proved to be a fine negotiator in bankruptcy. In the last round, he got a large stock position in the reorganized company in return for giving the company a license to use the name it already had: Trump. He also put in some cash, and the courts turned aside pleas from angry investors whose stakes were being wiped out.
With no buyer in sight, shares in Trump Entertainment fell to less than $11 this week, well below the $14.60 value assumed in the bankruptcy reorganization. Trump bonds also lost value.
Losses for shareholders are nothing new in the Trump empire. Trump Entertainment’s predecessor company, Trump Hotels and Casino Resorts, went public, owning just two of Mr. Trump’s casinos, in June 1995. The shares did well for a time, but plunged after deals in which Mr. Trump sold his two other casinos to the company, at prices some deemed excessive.
When the company went into reorganization, the old shares were all but wiped out. Each share, which cost $14 at the initial public offering, got 88 cents in a cash distribution, and one-thousandth of a share in the new company. Shareholders also got warrants to buy new shares at $14.60. If they exercised the warrants, which have since expired, they have new losses.
All told, ignoring the warrants, a shareholder who invested $10,000 in Mr. Trump’s empire when the casino company went public in 1995 would now have about $636.
That performance came at a time when the casino industry was blossoming across America, as more states accepted more gambling as a way to raise revenues.
I counted five other casino companies that went public in the mid-1990s. All made money for investors in the initial offering. The champion was Penn National Gaming, which will take your bets in West Virginia, Pennsylvania, Mississippi, Louisiana and in Ontario. It went public in 1994, and a $10,000 investment would now be worth about $724,000.
 Over all, an index of casino stocks is up 268 percent since June 1995. Trump investors lost 93 percent.
Why did they do so badly? Mr. Trump has an explanation. “The company has always been a relatively high-debt company,” he told me, and when it needed money the bond markets were not always friendly.
He has a point. Trump casinos were sometimes starved for capital investment, and they showed it. And while others expanded into new areas as markets opened up, Trump went only to Indiana, and its casino there was sold in 2005 to raise money. Recent efforts to expand into Pennsylvania, Mississippi and Rhode Island went nowhere.
The company now has a $250 million investment program to improve its Atlantic City hotels and casinos, and is spending a similar amount for a new tower at the Trump Taj Mahal.
“The places are starting to really look well,” said Mark Juliano, who became the interim chief executive this week, after his predecessor retired, the company said, to “return to his family in California.”
“The refurbishment is going along nicely,” Mr. Juliano added. “We are looking forward to a great summer.”
But there may be more than capital problems and run-down buildings at work in the sad performance.
 Trump’s companies are very complicated, with partnerships all over the place. At best, such complexity contributes to doubts that the boss has the same interests as public investors. Had a buyer been found, Trump Entertainment could have owed Mr. Trump up to $100 million to offset his capital gains taxes.
The two years since Trump Entertainment came out of bankruptcy have been good ones for owners of most casino companies. But not for this one. Mr. Trump’s name is, again, associated with a losing investment.
was briefly hospitalized last weekend for exhaustion, his publicist has said. The 33-year-old comedian, who in April broke the endurance record at the Laugh Factory comedy club in Los Angeles by delivering a more than six-hour stand-up routine, checked into a hospital on Saturday and was released a few hours later, the publicist, Carla Sims, said in Los Angeles. She declined to identify the hospital, but said Chappelle had simply been traveling and was otherwise "fine." Chappelle walked away from a $50 million deal to continue his Comedy Central show in May 2005 and traveled to South Africa. He has denied reports that he checked into a mental health center while visiting that country. (AP)
The Bollywood star Shah Rukh Khan has taken on the role of a protector of Indian wildlife, The Hindu newspaper has reported. Khan, 41, who has acted in more than 50 films, derides illegal trade in wild animals and promotes the work of forest guards in a new wildlife preservation campaign being screened at airports and on televisions across the country, the paper said. Poaching has savaged India's tiger population, which conservationists say has fallen to 2,000 or less, and a thriving black market exists for such animals as leopards and rhinoceroses. (Reuters)
Jackie Chan has agreed to star in a film about Chinese immigrants in the Shinjuku district of Tokyo, one of the city's most crowded shopping and entertainment districts, the actor's spokesman has said. The film, whose Chinese title translates as "Shinjuku Incident," will be directed by Derek Yee and is set to start filming in November. Chan's role will emphasize drama over action, Yee told the Beijing News in an article. "A few years ago the audience couldn't accept Jackie Chan as an actor," Yee told the paper. "But he has matured and the timing is right." The "Shinjuku Incident" will also star Ken Watanabe and Daniel Wu, the paper reported. Chan is currently shooting "The Forbidden Kingdom," a Hollywood kung-fu movie that costars Jet Li. (AP)
NBC hopes to revive Donald Trump's reality show "The Apprentice," at least for one more run: this time with celebrities playing for charity. And in another effort to revive the low-rated show, executives for the TV station said Trump was inviting the actress and comedian Rosie O'Donnell to join the cast. A spokeswoman for O'Donnell, however, quickly dismissed the idea, saying it would "never happen in this lifetime or beyond." Trump and O'Donnell engaged in a highly publicized spat last year after O'Donnell, then a host of the talk show "The View," mocked Trump for his rebuke of Tara Conner, Miss USA 2006, after Conner was seen drinking in New York bars while still underage.

Following their British counterparts, Borders bookstores in the United States are moving "Tintin in the Congo." Borders stores in London last week shifted the book to the graphic-novels shelves from the children's section. Borders representatives in the United States said the store would do the same because the book "could be considered offensive by some of our customers." Published in 1931 as the second in a series of 23 adventures of the intrepid Belgian boy reporter Tintin and his dog, Snowy, the book is being reissued in the United States in September to commemorate the centenary of its creator, Hergé, the pen name of Georges Remi. "The material suggests that Africans are subhumans, they are imbeciles," a London-based human-rights lawyer, David Enright, told The Associated Press. (AP. NYT)
A former political prisoner and human rights activist from Malawi has been nominated for the Forward Poetry Prize, a British honor that promotes contemporary poetry. Jack Mapanje was detained for three years until his release in 1991, and his most recent work, "Beast of Nalunga," is shortlisted for the honor. Also in the running for the £10,000 - or about $20,500 - award are Eavan Boland, Luke Kennard, Sean O'Brien, Adam Thorpe and John Burnside. Winners will be announced Oct. 3. (BBC)
The news only gets worse for Trump Entertainment Resorts.
The company today announced a second-quarter loss of $13.5 million as gambling revenue fell, for a loss 43 cents a share. Trump Entertainment, which operates three casinos in Atlantic City, lost $4.9 million, or 16 cents a share, in the period a year earlier.
That follows Trump Entertainment’s announcement last month that the company had not found a suitable buyer for the company despite several months on the auction blocks. In June, its chief executive, James B. Perry, stepped down during a broader management shake-up. 
And then there are the problems confronting all of Atlantic City’s casinos, which have been under increasing pressure from neighboring markets, especially since the opening of slot parlors in the Philadelphia area beginning last fall. 
Gambling revenue inside the city’s 11 casinos was down 4 percent through the first half of 2007. Gambling revenue through June 30 was down 3.3 percent at Trump Taj Mahal, 7.7 percent at Trump Plaza and 4.5 percent at Trump Marina.
“Virtually nothing has gone right for this company since the end of last year,” said Dennis Forst, an analyst with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Among Trump Entertainment’s woes, Mr. Forst said, was its unsuccessful bid to win a casino license in the Philadelphia area and its decision to scuttle plans to open a casino in Mississippi. 
Casino stocks have fallen broadly since the start of the year, according to KeyBanc’s index of casino and other gambling-related stocks. But where the KeyBanc index is down 10 percent through 2007, Trump stock has fallen 70 percent.
The company’s new chief executive, Mark Juliano, in a prepared statement released soon before the opening of trading today, noted that the company has spent tens of millions upgrading its operations over the last two years to draw what he described as “new, more profitable customers.”
“We deployed significant capital in the second quarter to promote our new facility enhancements and unified marketing program to a broader audience than ever before, while holding the line on promotional spending on less profitable database customers,” Mr. Juliano said. 
In March, when shares in Trump Entertainment Resorts were trading around $20, the company disclosed that it was seeking potential suitors for a takeover. At that point, Donald J. Trump even envisioned pocketing $500 million from selling at a handsome premium his one-third stake in this company bearing his name.
In July, when the company announced that it had not found a buyer despite a three-month search, shares in Trump Entertainment, which operates casino-hotels in Atlantic City, closed the day at $10.49. Mr. Trump’s stake was worth roughly $100 million. 
Those now look like the good old days.
With shares in the company at $5.51 at the opening of trading yesterday, Mr. Trump and other stockholders received more disappointing news as the company announced larger-than-expected losses in the second quarter. 
The company lost $13.5 million in the three-month period that ended June 30 as gambling revenues fell at all three of its casinos, for a loss of 43 cents a share. The company lost $4.9 million, or 16 cents a share, in the period a year earlier.
“Virtually nothing has gone right for this company since the end of last year,” said Dennis I. Forst, a gambling analyst with KeyBanc Capital Markets in Los Angeles.
Among Trump Entertainment’s more recent woes, Mr. Forst said, was its unsuccessful bid to win a casino license in Philadelphia after slot parlors were legalized in Pennsylvania and its decision to scuttle plans to open a casino in Mississippi. In June, the chief executive, James B. Perry, stepped down as part of a broader management shake-up. 
But perhaps the situation is looking up. Trump Entertainment’s stock surged yesterday by more than 26 percent, to $6.97 a share, as investors apparently expressed confidence in Mark Juliano, the new chief executive, a long-time industry figure who had been the chief operating officer.
“This was the first presentation of the new management team,” said Lawrence A. Klatzkin, a gambling analyst in New York with the investment firm Jefferies & Company. “They gave a good impression.” 
During a conference call with investors yesterday, Mr. Juliano also left the door open to the possibility of a takeover, and that could be contributing to the surge in share price. Some investors buying shares may be hoping a sale is still a possibility.
“We are continuing to look at any opportunity that comes our way,” Mr. Juliano said during the call. 
Mr. Juliano and the chief financial officer, Dale R. Black, also reassured investors that Trump Entertainment is in no immediate danger of defaulting on any of its loans despite the recent turbulence in credit markets. The company, whose bonds are considered less than investment grade, or junk, is carrying $1.56 billion in long-term debt while it continues construction on a new 40-story tower at the Trump Taj Mahal. It also is in the midst of a two-year $250 million capital improvement project aimed at making over its three properties. 
“If things get tight, we have the flexibility” to adjust spending, Mr. Black said. 
Compounding Trump Entertainment’s woes are the broader challenges confronting Atlantic City. Faced with increased competition from the new slot parlors that have opened in New York and the Philadelphia area this year, New Jersey’s gambling center is struggling to transform itself from a middle-market emporium mostly for busloads of people from around New York and Philadelphia into a world-class entertainment destination that draws free-spending tourists looking for several nights of fine food and club-hopping. 
Gambling revenue at the city’s 11 casinos was down 4 percent in the first half of 2007, compared with the period a year earlier. Gambling revenue through June 30 was down 3.3 percent at the Taj Mahal, 4.5 percent at Trump Marina and 7.7 percent at Trump Plaza.
While other casino companies are increasing promotional budgets to compete with out-of-state rivals, Trump Entertainment is doing the opposite. The company cut its promotional budget last quarter by $11 million, or 14 percent, Mr. Juliano said.
The aim, he explained, is to focus on higher-end customers even if it means losing business from the coupon-carrying retirees who have been the company’s bread and butter. 
“We are dedicated to attracting new, more profitable customers,” Mr. Juliano said. 
Say what you will about Robert Moses, master builder, despoiler of neighborhoods, symbol of all that is great and terrible in urban planning. At least he kept his name off things. And most of what he built, including his greatest achievement, Jones Beach State Park, was for the enjoyment and enrichment of the middle class. As high and mighty as Moses became, he never completely jettisoned the “public” from “public servant.”
Those aspects of Moses’ reputation were brought to mind recently by a dispute over an effort by a builder of a different era to reshape Jones Beach in the image of ... himself. That would be Donald J. Trump, who in the waning days of Gov. George Pataki’s administration snagged a 40-year lease to build an immense restaurant and catering hall on the boardwalk. 
The seaside palace, to be called Trump on the Ocean, was in the news recently when renderings were made public and officials were startled to realize that the building would look quite different from the historic, elegantly rustic limestone structures all around it. They seemed upset that the Trump name would loom THIS BIG over the sand, and expressed concern that the building materials were not the ones that had been agreed to.
“The image is not reflective of what’s required under the contract,” a state parks department spokeswoman, Eileen Larrabee, said, somewhat tactfully, in Newsday. What she and other officials did not quite bring themselves to say — but we will — is that Trump on the Ocean, at least as currently drawn, seems tacky, historically and architecturally disdainful, and ominously elitist. It risks giving a beachhead to Atlantic City crassness in a great New York sanctuary of sun, sand, surf and regular people. 
We should have known all along that we were not getting McKim, Mead & White. When Bernadette Castro, parks commissioner under Mr. Pataki, announced the Trump deal last year, likening it to “a gift from God,” a little skepticism was perfectly reasonable. Ms. Castro stressed the upside — that taxpayers were not paying a penny for it and that the site had lain fallow for years, with nobody else jumping to do anything with it.
But there were odd and off-putting details of the agreement, starting with the building’s grandiosity — it will be four times the size of the original 1936 restaurant — and its amazingly long lease of 40 years, a term matched by only one other New York State park concession, the Maid of the Mist boat ride at Niagara Falls. Though Trump on the Ocean will rise in the heart of one of the greatest public spaces in the state, nearly all of its business will be from private paying guests: catered wedding and bar mitzvah parties. New Yorkers owe a debt to Newsday for these details, which it got through the Freedom of Information law and analyzed with a healthy deafness to the Trump publicity megaphone and the Pataki-Castro echo chamber.
It is not inherently bad for a private developer to provide a service — and pursue a profit — in a state park. Mr. Trump is not a philanthropist or a historic preservationist, and no one expects him to be. Nor should anyone get too misty about Robert Moses; Robert Caro, in “The Power Broker,” detailed how Moses built that first restaurant on Jones Beach with a no-bid contract and used it as his personal South Shore Xanadu.
But no public asset — certainly not one as irreplaceably grand and egalitarian as Jones Beach — should be handed over irresponsibly for the aggrandizement of a private concessionaire. The beauty of Jones Beach is as a public refuge for all New Yorkers. The beach is the thing. Whatever is built beside it must complement that purpose, not serve as a limestone scaffolding for a single ego or a vast national publicity machine.
It is a relief to know that state parks officials, under a new governor, are wary too, and will be looking closely to make sure Mr. Trump and his partners honor both their agreement and their oft-stated commitment to make Jones Beach a better place. 
Raising questions about how much Rutgers University spends on football is viewed in New Jersey as something akin to disloyalty. 
Rutgers has long suffered with some terrible football teams. Now, with the Scarlet Knights coming off last year’s 11-2 season, New Jersey is agog with talk of a Big East football championship this season — and maybe even an invitation to join the Big Ten. Seats for home games this fall are just about sold out, something that certainly hasn’t happened anytime recently.
But at this time of fiscal woe in Trenton and at Rutgers, it would be pure insanity for state officials from Gov. Jon Corzine on down not to seriously question the university’s preliminary plan to spend more than $100 million on expanding its football stadium. 
Amid a near taxpayer revolt, the state faces a budget deficit of at least $2 billion that nobody knows how to deal with. Last year, the state cut $66 million out of Rutgers’s $1.6 billion budget. The university canceled hundreds of classes and downgraded six varsity teams to club level, saving $800,000 or so in scholarship, travel and coaching expenses — a relatively trivial amount compared to the estimated stadium costs. 
With rising tuition, it now costs a New Jersey resident $20,000 a year to study and reside at Rutgers’s main campus — about two-thirds of the average cost at a private university.
Despite all this, Rutgers officials have quietly committed almost $1 million to design a plan that would add 12,000 new seats and some luxury boxes to its 42,000-seat football stadium. According to estimates that The Record of Bergen County pried loose as a result of the state’s Open Public Records Act, the expansion would cost $116 million. About $86 million of that would be borrowed by the university; the remaining $30 million would come from the state. Rutgers points out that the plan is not final and could be scaled down. 
In a state with a $33 billion budget, $30 million is not much money. But it takes on symbolic importance considering that New Jerseyans are paying higher and higher property taxes and Trenton is struggling to scrape up enough money for current expenses. In a year when Mr. Corzine and numerous legislators are talking about the need for financial sacrifice, should the state really be spending more money on football? 
And what about Rutgers? After canceled classes and tuition increases, should football command enough priority to merit borrowing $86 million? We think not. 
 It’s not as if football has been a poor relative at Rutgers. Spurred on by enthusiastic legislators, the university embarked on an intensive campaign to make the team a national power. In 2000, it hired a nationally known coach, paid him a salary that now totals about $1.5 million and gave him great leeway to spend what he deemed necessary. 
 Last year, the football budget totaled $13 million. Meanwhile, except for women’s and men’s basketball, the university was giving most other sports short shrift. 
Perhaps because of the increased exposure, enrollment at Rutgers is way up, and advocates say the investment in football will pay off. That may be true when it comes to the football program, but some noted economists express doubt that big-college football ever does much more than pay for itself, even in the best of seasons. By adding seats at the stadium, Rutgers officials believe they will bring in added revenue. What happens when losing seasons come and the fans don’t? 
Rutgers and the state of New Jersey long ago made the decision to spend huge amounts on their football team. In view of the hard times both face, they must now consider whether it makes sense to spend even more money just to expand a stadium. 
BRASÍLIA, Sept. 21 — In recent months the political climate in Brazil has been a boiling caldron for Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, the country’s president.
The second deadly airplane crash in 10 months set off a crisis in Brazil’s aviation industry in July, with many critics saying government inaction was at the root of the problem.
 Last month, the country’s Supreme Court ordered seven members of the president’s political party and 33 others to stand trial on corruption charges in a scandal that has netted some of his closest advisers, including his former chief of staff. 
But as Mr. da Silva, now in his second term, sat down for a 75-minute interview here in the presidential palace, those worries hardly seemed to faze him. He was nothing but upbeat, and with good reason.
Despite the controversies, Mr. da Silva’s approval rating hovers above 60 percent. Brazil, Latin America’s largest economy, has grown by 3.5 percent a year, slower than China and India but a marked improvement over the 1990s. Debt levels and unemployment are down. Reserves are up. Inflation is one-third what it was five years ago. 
“We are experiencing an auspicious moment in Brazil right now,” Mr. da Silva, 61, said in his first extended discussion with an American journalist since 2004. “Brazil is experiencing its best economic period.”
That boom combined with his broad popularity among Brazil’s working class has provided Mr. da Silva, a former metal worker with a sixth-grade education who worked in an auto plant, with remarkable political resilience. 
“He is the Teflon president,” said David Fleischer, a political analyst here and an emeritus professor at the University of Brasília. “Nothing sticks to Lula.”
That includes the scandals that by now could have debilitated another presidency. But Mr. da Silva continued to deny knowing anything about the most recent one, in which members of the governing party are accused of paying congressional deputies more than $10,000 a month to vote for favored legislation.
He refused to say if anyone in particular had betrayed him. “There are hundreds of employees around me that I don’t have any idea what they are doing,” Mr. da Silva said. 
One of them, apparently, was his former chief of staff, José Dirceu, whom many consider the architect of Mr. da Silva’s rise to power, and who has been charged with being the mastermind of the vote-buying scheme.
“I don’t believe that there is any evidence that Mr. Dirceu committed the crime that he is being charged with,” the president said. “He will be judged.”
Fresh from a trip to Europe, where he stirred interest in Brazil’s sugar-based ethanol fuel and won billions of dollars in investment pledges, Mr. da Silva was instead focused on the economy. 
Exports of Brazil’s raw commodities like soybeans and iron ore are booming as a result of high global prices and insatiable demand from Asia. In one sign of Brazil’s economic health, as the subprime credit crisis was roiling the United States a few weeks ago, Brazil’s bonds were raised to just below investment grade.
He said that Latin America as a whole was at a critical moment, when it needed to seize the opportunity to shore up its economies, notorious for mismanagement and corruption. 
At the same time, he shrugged off suggestions that he should seek to be a hemispheric force and a stronger counterweight to President Hugo Chávez of Venezuela, who has aggressively seized the spotlight in the region with his energy deal-making and political maneuvering in favor of left-wing candidates.
“We in Latin America are not trying to look for a leader,” Mr. da Silva said. “We don’t need a leader. What we need to do is build political harmony because South America and Latin America need to learn the lesson of the 20th century. We had the opportunity to grow, we had the opportunity to develop ourselves, and we lost that opportunity. So we still continue to be poor countries. 
“What I want is to govern my country well.”
As Mr. da Silva heads to New York on Sunday for a United Nations meeting, he is relentlessly pitching Brazil’s agricultural potential and energy experience, especially in ethanol, which Brazil makes from sugar cane, a source more efficient than corn. 
With ample arable land that is the envy of the world, and a 20-year head start on developing a biofuels industry, Brazil is the only country exporting ethanol in any significant quantities.
Mr. da Silva predicted that within 15 years a global biofuels industry would be developed, with the commodity being shipped around the world on tankers for a global price. 
“I believe that the world will yield to biofuels,” he said. 
He found a receptive audience recently in Sweden, where he rode in an all-ethanol-powered bus in Stockholm, one of 600 buses, he said, that the Swedish government had retrofitted for use with biofuels. Sweden wants every new car on the road to run on renewable fuels by 2020. The European Union has recommended its countries add 5.7 percent ethanol to the gasoline supply by 2010.
“We will democratize energy access,” he said. “Instead of 10 countries producing oil, we could have 120 countries producing biofuels.”
So far, however, a biofuels accord Mr. da Silva signed with President Bush this year has yet to yield concrete results. The two countries agreed to share technology and experience to develop technical standards. 
An import tariff in the United States, supported by the powerful farm lobby, has prevented Brazil from competing for a share of the American market with corn-based ethanol. 
 Relations are generally warm with the United States. But Brazil’s relations with Venezuela have been strained at times with Mr. Chávez as Brazil has appeared to shy away from some of Mr. Chávez’s proposals for greater regional integration. 
In the interview, however, Mr. da Silva offered tacit support for the creation of a “Bank of the South,” which could provide more money for development.
He also said that more than 50 experts from Petrobras, Brazil’s state oil company, and officials from Petróleos de Venezuela were still discussing a $15 billion natural gas pipeline project that would stretch 5,000 miles from Venezuela to Argentina. 
A crucial question is whether enough gas exists to make it viable, Mr. da Silva said. Mr. Chávez on Thursday again blamed Petrobras for delays in approving the project, Reuters reported.
The economic focus was consistent with Mr. da Silva’s move to the center since he took office in January 2003. 
Since then he extended many of the economic policies of his predecessor, Fernando Henrique Cardoso, while putting in place programs like Family Allowance, a welfare program devised to help the poor. Last year, the program offered monthly subsidies of about $50 to some 11 million families, representing 40 million to 50 million voters.
Mr. da Silva’s personal story has inspired millions of Brazilians: he grew up dirt poor in a small town and later worked as a lathe operator at an auto plant. He found his calling as a labor leader and politician. 
Despite his modest education and sometimes questionable grammar, his personal warmth and colorful references to Brazilian soccer have captivated many.
When he steps down in 2010, Mr. da Silva said, he plans to head back home to São Bernardo do Campo, the hardscrabble industrial town near São Paulo where he got his start in politics with the metal workers’ union. 
“I am not going to go on a graduate study program at Harvard University,” he said, in a dig at his predecessor, Mr. Cardoso, who regularly teaches at Brown.
“When I leave the presidency,” he said, “the one thing I want in life is to be treated as a friend by all of those who were my friends before I took office.”
Not sure how to decorate your Gulfstream? Wondering which continent to golf on next? Then Donald J. Trump has a magazine for you.
The Ocean Drive Media Group, which publishes more than a dozen small magazines for wealthy readers, and Mr. Trump will announce plans today to introduce a magazine devoted to ways to spend a great deal of money. In keeping with the usual modesty of America’s favorite real estate baron/author/radio host/reality show boss, the title will be Trump magazine.
 And will Mr. Trump’s picture grace the first cover, due out in November?
“Only if they want to sell a lot of magazines,” Mr. Trump said in a telephone interview yesterday (actually, the publisher and Mr. Trump said, that decision has not been made yet).
The magazine is not to be confused with an earlier venture of the same name, originally called Trump World, which was published from 2004 through this year. That title was produced by a different outfit, Premiere Publishing Group, and available primarily in Mr. Trump’s residential and retail buildings, hotels and resorts.
The new magazine, to be published quarterly, will have wider distribution than its predecessor, with an initial run of 100,000 copies, said Jerry Powers, chairman of Ocean Drive Media. While it will be distributed free to Trump properties, he said, it will also be sold for $5.95 in airports, bookstores and newsstands in a handful of cities where his buildings are concentrated.
“We’re going to start with Chicago, Miami, Palm Beach, L.A., New York, a couple of others,” he said.
Glen Albin, a veteran of Ocean Drive and Interview magazines, will be the editor.
“We’re going to do stories on private jets, the interiors of the new jets, new lines of Louis Vuitton luggage, Mikimoto pearls, stories on very high-end jewelry like Cartier, travel around the world, golf clubs, fashion,” Mr. Powers said. “It’s definitely aimed at the reader who doesn’t have to ask how much it costs.”
This is familiar territory for Ocean Drive. Some of its other titles focus on particular places  South Florida, Atlanta, Chicago  and it produces in-room magazines for the Wynn and Venetian hotels in Las Vegas.
For Mr. Trump, who has a new book coming out next month (about  surprise  the need to be aggressive in business and life), the magazine project is yet another form of exposure, but not the financial kind. “I put up no money,” he said.
BANGKOK, Oct. 1  For two decades, Myanmar’s neighbors have grappled with how to respond to the unrelenting repression of the country’s people by its ruling generals. In Thailand, the answer comes each time anyone pays an electric bill. 
 Natural gas from Myanmar, which generates 20 percent of all electricity in Thailand, keeps the lights on in Bangkok. The gas, which this year will cost about $2.8 billion, is the largest single export for Myanmar’s impoverished, cash-strapped economy. 
Thailand’s gas imports highlight the difficulty facing China, India, Singapore and Malaysia, among other countries, as they vie for Myanmar’s hardwoods, minerals and gems  and access to its market of 47 million people. 
At a time of rising energy prices, the prospect of extracting resources appears to override the embarrassment and shame of dealing with a junta that has attracted worldwide condemnation. For that reason, the countries with the most leverage over Myanmar seem the most reluctant to use it, analysts say. 
For Myanmar’s generals, the gas purchases by Thailand are only the beginning of what promises to be a significant infusion of cash. Myanmar will soon announce the winner of a concession in the Shwe gas fields off the western coast. Companies from India, China and South Korea have bid for those contracts. 
In eastern Myanmar, Thai companies are building hydropower plants and have contracts to pay the government billions of dollars for electricity from them. 
“For a country that’s used to a hand-to-mouth existence there is suddenly a bonanza of foreign exchange,” said Sean Turnell, a specialist on the Myanmar economy at Macquarie University in Australia. “Burma is now getting the wherewithal to tell the world to bug off.” 
The cash has allowed the generals who run Myanmar to buy weapons from China and helicopters from India, order a nuclear test reactor from Russia and construct their new administrative capital north of Yangon. 
“The natural gas drastically changed the military government’s fiscal position,” said Toshihiro Kudo, director of the Southeast Asian Studies Group at the Institute of Developing Economies, a research organization run by the Japanese government. 
Myanmar’s gas reserves are small by global standards. BP, the oil company, estimates the total at 538 billion cubic meters, or 19 trillion cubic feet, far less than the reserves of nearby Malaysia or Indonesia. But the billions of dollars those gas fields will produce is valuable to the ruling generals, whose sources of financing are extremely limited because of American sanctions. 
Largely because of the gas deal, Thailand now accounts for more than 40 percent of Myanmar’s total exports and has become its biggest trading partner, not China, as is widely reported. 
“Thailand and Myanmar are increasingly integrated, increasingly dependent on each other,” Mr. Kudo said. As a result, “I don’t think that Thailand is applying any very serious pressure on the military government.” 
At the United Nations last week, the Thai prime minister, Surayud Chulanont, called the Myanmar crackdown unacceptable. Thai newspapers have run scathing editorials about Myanmar’s generals. And Thailand remains a refuge for dissidents from Myanmar. 
But the bottom line, Thai officials say, is that Thailand is competing for the world’s energy resources, and if it does not buy the gas, someone else will. 
Gen. Sonthi Boonyaratglin, the army chief who led Thailand’s military coup last year, said last week that Thailand should stay engaged with Myanmar. “There are many friendly nations who help Myanmar like China and Korea because Myanmar is a country with plenty of natural resources that the powerful nations want to obtain,” he said. 
For China, the attraction of Myanmar is both economic and geostrategic. As part of its bid for the gas fields off western Myanmar, China has proposed building a pipeline from the Bay of Bengal through Myanmar and into Yunnan Province. Another pipeline could carry crude oil delivered by ships from the Middle East. 
For Myanmar, the gas fields would mean more cash. Mr. Turnell estimated that gas pumped from Shwe platforms would have a value of $2 billion a year.
The majority of the beaten All Blacks were on Monday beginning what promised to be a long flight home to face a nation grieving and raging after the team lost to France in the Rugby World Cup quarterfinal last weekend.
Some were traveling later because of the unavailability of seats to New Zealand at such short notice, Scott Compton, the team press officer said in a phone interview Monday. He added that others were staying because family members had come over on nonrefundable tickets to watch New Zealand play in the later stages of the competition.
No one had planned for defeat in the quarterfinals. For the All Blacks, the Rugby World Cup was not supposed to end like this. It never is. It always does.
Of all the leading nations, New Zealand is the only one that can claim that rugby union is, unquestionably, its national sport. That is partly a cause of its success and partly an effect. For a small nation to be top in a world sport is a source of pride. It is also a source of pressure - immense pressure.
It has been the dominant team since it won its first test match, against Australia in 1903. The legend of the All Blacks - indeed, the name itself - was born on its first tour of the British Isles in 1905. It lost only one game on that visit, 3-0, to Wales in Cardiff, also the site of its latest humiliation over the weekend. Even today, New Zealanders complain they were robbed of a try in that game, highlighting an abiding problem: a reluctance to admit they were fairly beaten.
In all, New Zealand has won 318 of its 429 internationals, which, allowing for draws, is a winning percentage of 74.1.
The only nation to stand up to New Zealand for long periods was South Africa. That is partly because the New Zealand authorities showed their support for apartheid by leaving "black," or Maori, players at home when they toured South Africa. Australia is the only other country to have lost fewer than two-thirds of its tests against New Zealand. The Wallabies briefly usurped All Black hegemony in the 1990s with an exceptional generation of players.
For the All Blacks, every generation of players, it seems, is exceptional. Under Graham Henry, who took over as coach after the last World Cup, it has won 41 of its 47 matches. That is not good enough. The announcement Sunday that New Zealand was starting its search for a new coach at once, suggested that, like his four predecessors, Henry is heading out the door as fast as possible.
Where other nations may struggle to fill certain positions, the All Blacks seem to be strong everywhere. The squad it sent to the World Cup had no filler. Every player was big and fast and skilful and disciplined. All were muscled to the limit of what seemed possible.
So why do they lose in World Cups?
There are of course particular circumstances surrounding each defeat.
In 1991, Australia was simply the better team and eliminated New Zealand, 16-6, in a semifinal in Dublin.
In 1995, New Zealand again arrived at the World Cup as an outsider. That changed the moment they unleashed Jonah Lomu, the most dangerous finisher in World Cup history. Yet they lost the final, beaten 15-12 in extra time at altitude in Johannesburg by a Springbok team inspired by its role as standard bearer for the Rainbow Nation.
The All Backs, as ever, had an excuse. They blamed an outbreak of food poisoning before the final. The untraceable South African waitress who served the fateful meal has become New Zealand's equivalent of the gunman on the grassy knoll.
In 1999, New Zealand led a French team that had finished as also-rans in that season's Five Nations by 14 points at Twickenham. France conjured 20 minutes of brilliance and won, 43-31. New Zealanders moaned about dirty play and said the result had been a fluke. The French could never do that again.
In 2003, New Zealand was, as Anton Oliver - its hooker in 1999, 2003 and again Saturday - said last week "slowly strangled to death" by the Wallabies in a semifinal in Sydney. Australia won, 22-10.
And this year? This year, France, which had not beaten New Zealand since 2000, did it again. It trailed by 13 points, scored two dazzling tries and won, 20-18.
Back in New Zealand, the fans and pundits scrambled for reasons for the defeat. They blamed their pampered players. They blamed the soft first round, which left their team "underdone." They blamed their neurotic coaches.
The Kiwis reserved their greatest bile for Wayne Barnes, the English referee, for missing a forward pass that led to the second try and for sending Luke McAlister off for 10 minutes, a call that was both harsh and fair.
Perhaps the most significant whistle Barnes blew was in the first few minutes, when he penalized Richie McCaw, the All Black captain, for lying on the wrong side of a ruck, signaling he would not tolerate a favorite All Black trick.
One fundamental problem the All Blacks have is that while they are expected to beat everyone else all the time, the other nations just need to focus on beating the All Blacks and they need to do it only once every four years, at a World Cup.
The French, in particular, are obsessed with the All Blacks. The France coach, Bernard Laporte, has known for four years that if his team was to achieve its stated goal of winning the World Cup, it would probably have to beat New Zealand. He and his players were able to focus on developing both tactics and a mind-set for that game. It paid off.
A more profound problem might also be the central importance of rugby in New Zealand itself and the growing burden of repeated failures.
In an interview published Monday in L'Équipe, the French sports daily, Oliver likened the atmosphere in the dressing room after the game Saturday to Passchendaele, the World War I battle where Dave Gallaher, the captain of the 1905 All Blacks, died.
"It was like being in no man's land," Oliver said. "A place of desolation and putrefaction and, without wishing to overdramatize, the smell of death."
Edward Gay of the New Zealand Herald, took consolation in writing, without any detectable irony, that the All Blacks were still the best rugby team in the world and went on the say that the same had been true in 2003 and 1999.
To that, the answer is a line that George Gregan, an Australian scrum half, gleefully offered the All Blacks as the players shook hands at the end of the 2003 semifinal: "Four more years, boys. Four more years."
This time, the All Blacks can take some heart as they contemplate another four years in which they will pulverize all and sundry while waiting impatiently, and fearfully, for the next World Cup.
The only time they won was as host in the first World Cup, in 1987. In 2011, they will be host again. If they cannot win again at home, maybe they never will.
Trump Soho 
 There was a time when the name “Trump SoHo” would have sounded like an oxymoron or a punch line. That time has passed. A 46-story, $3,000-a-square-foot condo-hotel with that very name is climbing into the skyline from a section of Manhattan once considered so hopeless that it might as well be razed to accommodate an expressway. Of course, some people still won’t accept the idea — like the neighborhood residents and preservationists who recently converged outside a promotional party for the project, waving signs scrawled with slogans like “Earth to Trump: Get Out of SoHo Now!” Donald Trump thanked them for the free publicity and claimed that although the building won’t open until 2009, there are already 3,200 purchase applications for its 400 units.
The building is backed by a partnership among the Trump Organization, the Bayrock Group and the Sapir Organization, but there was little question whose name would be slapped on the property. Trump’s company actually sells the right to use his name on dozens of luxury condos around the world, and, according to Forbes magazine, charges 8 to 15 percent of gross sales (meaning Trump is making money even if the licensee isn’t). Forbes calls the licensing business “the most valuable piece of the Trump empire by far.”
Bayrock’s executive vice president, Julius Schwarz, says Trump SoHo is a partnership deal, not a licensing one. But the bottom line is that the word “Trump” adds to the bottom line. “Trump’s name brings the highest premium,” says Alex Sapir, president of the Sapir Organization. “I don’t think there’s any other household real estate name.” True enough, but what does that name mean in the households of downtown Manhattan? “I don’t know if it would have worked 10 years ago,” Sapir says. But downtown, he adds, “has changed incredibly.”
Indeed, SoHo in 2007 is far removed from its days as a haven for artists, which is what made the neighborhood famous. Paper magazine, the longtime chronicler of downtown culture that was started in SoHo in 1984, just last year moved its offices from nearby TriBeCa to 32nd Street, says Kim Hastreiter, one of its founders. “We couldn’t afford it anymore,” she says. As it happens, Hastreiter, not long out of art school, was among those who, in the 1970s, took advantage of a city-backed plan that gave artists special tax deals to move into the sketchy stretch of neglected former factories. That was back when The New York Times still needed to explain that “SoHo” wasn’t a reference to the London neighborhood but a shortening of a city-planning designation for the area, South Houston Industrial District. By then the expressway scheme had faded; uptown art dealers and historic-district designation followed. And New York being New York, so did disillusion. One skeptic sneered to The Times that the area was becoming “a completely fake Bohemia, filled with dead ideas and dead art” and galleries that may as well “sell by mail order to Wichita.” This was in 1975.
Hastreiter is more generous. Even today a “downtown of the mind” persists, she says, although she’s referring more to a mind-set or an attitude than any particular place. She figures that SoHo, as a patch of geography where that mind-set flourished, “started to die like 15 years ago.” Now synonymous with pricey shopping, high-end dining, wildly expensive living spaces and posh hotels, the word SoHo means about what the word Trump means: money. “You have to be rich” to live in contemporary SoHo, Hastreiter observes. “Probably more rich than you have to be to live on the Upper East Side.”
And that’s the point. Sapir himself maintains that SoHo and TriBeCa are among the most expensive neighborhoods in New York. But, of course, he and his partners see this as a sign of vitality, not death. To them, the project is about the downtowning of Trump, with key roles played by the “next generation” — Ivanka and Donald Jr. — in various design and décor decisions. Sapir (who is 27) seems to choose his words carefully when he says this Trump property will be “a little less exaggerative,” using materials that are “rich” but “don’t scream.” Presumably this means less emphasis on the color gold. “It’s for everybody who loves to enjoy life, who enjoys the finer things,” Sapir offers. “It’s fun. There’s been five-star in New York, but there’s never been five-star fun, five-star cool.” After all, he says, “this is SoHo.” And so it is. 
WASHINGTON, Nov. 5 — When it comes to the state and local ballot measures before voters across the country on Tuesday, it is mostly about the money.
While hot-button issues like immigration and gay rights attracted the focus of measures in the past several elections, nuts-and-bolts concerns like health care financing, road projects and land-use regulations fill local and state tickets this time.
Overall, Election Day is expected to be a calmer affair this year. There is only one Congressional race (a special primary in the Fifth District in Ohio), and the presidential vote is a year away. Few close contests are expected as voters choose governors in two states and mayors in five major cities.
There are 34 statewide propositions in 6 states being decided, down from 204 in 37 states in 2006, and 39 the year before, according to the Initiative and Referendum Institute at the University of Southern California, which tracks ballot trends. In 2006, 9 states had statewide ballot initiatives concerning gay rights and 3 states had initiatives on marijuana use. No states have ballot measures concerning either issue on Tuesday.
 In the Mississippi governor’s race, John Arthur Eaves Jr., a Democrat and long shot to win, is running an overtly religious campaign in the hope of stealing some of the evangelical support behind the Republican incumbent, Haley Barbour, who is ahead in fund-raising.
In Kentucky, Gov. Ernie Fletcher, a Republican, has staged a comeback from just over a year and a half ago when he was under indictment and had approval ratings in the 20s. Still, his Democratic opponent, Steve Beshear, a former lieutenant governor and former attorney general, is expected to win the seat, which was held by Democrats for more than three decades before Mr. Fletcher’s victory in 2003.
Democrats are also expected to win mayoral contests in Pittsburgh, Philadelphia, San Francisco, Baltimore and Houston. In the Congressional race in Ohio, both parties are holding primaries to fill the seat of Representative Paul E. Gillmor, a Republican, who died in September.
Among the ballot measures, school financing is a particularly hot topic as voters in at least six states — California, Maine, Minnesota, North Carolina, Utah and Virginia — decide local and state measures on education spending.
In Minnesota, more than 120 school districts are asking for more money. In Ohio, where lawmakers have struggled to fix a school-financing system that has been ruled unconstitutional four times since 1997, more than 220 tax levies or bond issues related to school financing are on local ballots.
On the heels of several years of record borrowing by local and state officials, agencies closest to the ground — school districts, for example — are finding it tougher to stretch finances, and administrators are increasingly turning to voters for bailouts.
Overcrowding has left school officials in Antelope Valley, Calif., about an hour north of Los Angeles, asking voters to decide on $240 million in bonds for new construction and renovations.
In Fairfax County, Va., a well-to-do but rapidly expanding Washington suburb, the ballot contains a $365 million bond to build and refurbish schools.
Teachers’ unions and other education groups in Utah have pushed a referendum to repeal a new law that provides school vouchers of $500 to $3,000 to low-income students. The original law was narrowly approved by the Republican-controlled Legislature earlier this year.
G. Terry Madonna, a professor of public affairs and director of the Keystone Poll at Franklin & Marshall College in Pennsylvania, said that especially in areas with recent population growth, local needs have grown but budgets have shrunk and local officials are often required by state constitutions to get permission from voters for new spending.
Some of the most expensive fights involve health care financing.
In Oregon, tobacco companies have spent more than $10 million to block a measure that would increase cigarette taxes by 84.5 cents a pack. The increase would be used to pay for health care for uninsured children. Supporters of the expanded health care coverage have raised almost $1.4 million, much of the money coming from hospitals and health insurance companies, and spent about $460,000 on television advertisements. The spending by both sides has made the ballot measure the most expensive in the state’s history.
Tobacco companies have waged equally aggressive fights in recent years in California and Missouri to defeat similar measures, though one such measure passed last year in Arizona despite efforts by the companies.
In Washington State, trial lawyers and insurance companies are battling a proposal to repeal a state law that allows consumers to seek triple damages in court against nonmedical insurers that unreasonably deny claims. 
Oregon voters are also deciding whether to scale back a 2004 law requiring governments to compensate landowners for any loss in value caused by land-use regulations, or to waive those regulations. 
So-called wedge issues are not entirely absent from Tuesday’s tickets.
In Texas, conservatives oppose the omission of a stem cell research ban in Proposition 15, a constitutional amendment that would allow the state to borrow $300 million a year over the next decade to finance cancer research.
In Hailey, Idaho, voters are faced with four initiatives that would legalize or decriminalize marijuana and direct city officials to lobby for the passage of similar measures statewide.
In Denver, an initiative would make the private use and possession of an ounce or less of marijuana by people 21 and older the city’s lowest law-enforcement priority. Supporters of the proposed initiative, which is similar to regulations in Seattle and Missoula County, Mont., say that the police have more pressing problems and that the use of small amounts of marijuana is less harmful than alcohol to adults.
Voters in Missoula will decide on a measure calling for the immediate withdrawal of American troops from Iraq. If it is passed, Missoula would join more than 200 other cities and towns that have passed similar resolutions.
The developer Donald J. Trump pledged yesterday to rescue the troubled EnCap golf and housing development in the New Jersey Meadowlands, saying he would come up with a new design, a world-class golf course and more upscale housing. 
Mr. Trump said in an interview that he had signed a deal to become a 50-50 partner with the current builder, Cherokee Investment Partners, in developing 785 acres covering four garbage dumps stretching across Lynhurst and Rutherford, N.J. The developer said he had already started interviewing five firms to find a new master planner for the project.
“This has the potential to be one of the great jobs anywhere in the world,” Mr. Trump said about 30 minutes after he signed the deal. “We’re going to make it that.”
But Mr. Trump’s sudden involvement caught many politicians and public officials by surprise and did little to mollify environmentalists, politicians and other critics who have described the project as a dangerous boondoggle. 
“We don’t have any information concerning Mr. Trump, nor has anyone at this agency been approached by Mr. Trump,” said Christopher Gale, a spokesman for the Meadowlands Commission.
The commission, which serves as the planning agency for the 30 square miles of swamps, streams and land that make up the Meadowlands, selected a division of Cherokee Investment Partners, EnCap Golf Holdings, to develop the property in 1999. But in September, the commission put EnCap on notice that it had defaulted on its agreement and ultimately set a Nov. 20 deadline for EnCap to remedy a long list of financial and environmental problems. 
“It doesn’t matter if they bring in Trump but do not change the cleanup plan,” said Jeffrey Tittel, director of the New Jersey chapter of the Sierra Club. “It’s still a bad project. They’re putting over 2,000 units of housing on top of a toxic landfill. Landfills are unstable.”
At a news conference on Wednesday afternoon, Gov. Jon S. Corzine declined to comment on Mr. Trump’s possible involvement in the Meadowlands. But he did say that the project needed a new developer. “I think a takeout of the current developer is a good idea,” Mr. Corzine said. 
The possibility of a deal between Cherokee and Mr. Trump was first reported by The Record of Hackensack yesterday.
Cherokee Investment Partners released a statement last night confirming the deal with Mr. Trump.
“Cherokee Investment Partners has signed an agreement with the Trump Organization for complete operational management of the Meadowlands Redevelopment Project,” said David J. O’Neill, a Cherokee vice president. “Cherokee is committed to the remediation and redevelopment of the Meadowlands in a manner that is safe and environmentally responsible and that produces economic benefits for the surrounding communities. We believe that the Trump Organization is the right partner to accomplish these goals.”
It is unclear whether Cherokee will provide additional money for the project. But a real estate executive briefed on the negotiations said that Cherokee had paid Pulte Homes $8 million to $10 million to buy out its $150 million contract to develop 2,000 apartments and town houses on the site.
Much is at stake for Cherokee, which is based in North Carolina and describes itself as the largest private equity fund in the world specializing in the remediation and redevelopment of brownfields. Its EnCap division was supposed to have cleaned the site of contaminated soil and capped the four garbage dumps before building two golf courses, a hotel, 2,580 housing units and stores.
After cleanup costs soared in 2005, the state provided $212 million in loans rather than allow the project to stall or collapse. But the company has come under fire for failing to clean the site properly. And environmentalists say that the site cannot sustain so much housing.
Cherokee may have approached Mr. Trump because of his success in developing the Trump National Golf Club in Bedminster and because he may attract new capital. Mr. Trump enjoys riding to the rescue as he did in the 1980s, when he rebuilt the Wollman Rink in Central Park after city officials had bungled the job for years.
“This is a large-scale Wollman’s skating rink,” Mr. Trump said, adding that he would like to build even more housing units than EnCap had envisioned.
Cherokee may have also sought Mr. Trump’s help because the state has approached other developers to replace EnCap. 
But State Senator Loretta Weinberg, a critic of the project, was unimpressed with the latest maneuver.
“I’m not prepared to think of new ideas until I figure out what happened with this bad idea,” Ms. Weinberg said. “This has been such a huge boondoggle that the Legislature and people we represent have a right to know how we got here and who should be returning money to the state. All that has to be taken into consideration in terms of bringing in a new developer.” 
HAVANA, Nov. 11 — A trade fair in Communist Cuba is perhaps the last place you would expect to find a Republican governor from the American heartland. Yet last week, Gov. Dave Heineman of Nebraska was here to sign a deal to export $11 million worth of his state’s wheat to the island. 
Asked the obvious question about whether longstanding American trade sanctions should be lifted, Governor Heineman ducked and weaved like a professional boxer. “Well, I try not to get into that, because that’s up to the president and the Congress, but I will say expanding trade relationships is good for Nebraska and altogether good for America,” he said.
Just weeks after President Bush delivered an address calling on the world to isolate Cuba, officials from Minnesota, Alabama and Ohio — and more than 100 American businesses — were working the giant Havana International Fair, trying to secure part of the $1.6 billion the Cuban government spends each year to import sugar, wheat, livestock, poultry and beans, among other staples.
Those business interests clash with the Bush administration’s anti-Castro policies, as well as the need of both Democrats and Republicans to court Cuban exiles in Florida, a crucial voting bloc. So while some trade with Cuba is allowed, it is fraught with restrictions. A 1992 law, for instance, denies ships access to American ports for six months after they have docked in Cuba, making shipping tricky, to say the least. 
Several Americans here said they were frustrated that the sanctions have proved more a source of irritation for those who want to do business with Cuba than a crippling blow to Fidel Castro. 
 “They are doing everything they can to make it difficult,” said Ralph Kaehler, a Minnesota farmer who sells cattle feed in Cuba. “It’s unfortunate.”
American businesspeople and state officials have been coming to the fair for six years, ever since Congress gave in to pressure from the agriculture lobby in late 2000, during the waning days of the Clinton administration, and lifted a four-decade ban on selling food to Cuba. 
Since then, the number of farm states and agribusinesses who want a piece of the Cuban market has been growing, despite the Bush administration’s steady tightening of sanctions. For farm states, the need for jobs has trumped cold-war politics. 
“It’s helped our economy,” said Ron Sparks, the Alabama agriculture commissioner, as he talked with people near the booth for the Mobile Port Authority. “It’s helped our farmers. I don’t talk national policy.”
Now in its 25th year, the annual trade fair drew more than 1,000 companies from 53 countries to a sprawling fairground known as Expocuba just outside Havana.
 The atmosphere was festive, with more than a dozen restaurants where people drank Havana Club rum and puffed on Cuba’s famous cigars, a treat several Americans appeared to enjoy. The five-day fair, which ended Saturday, also attracted hundreds of ordinary Cubans. 
Aside from state officials, the American delegation included several shipping companies and large agricultural outfits like Pilgrim’s Pride, Cargill and Purdue. Their sales representatives worked in the booths all day before returning to the Hotel Nacional, an art deco landmark, and then heading out to enjoy the Havana night life.
Some Americans at the fair predicted that Cuba’s market would open up more after Fidel Castro gave up power permanently, and they said they wanted to get a head start on deal making. Many envision a return to the prerevolution days when the United States was Cuba’s biggest trading partner, as wheat and durable goods flowed south while sugar, tobacco and rum flowed north.
But financial and travel restrictions have never been tighter, as the Bush administration has quietly stepped up the prohibition of tourism to and from Cuba and invented new ways to squeeze the island financially. It has also increased efforts to fine international banks that handle transactions in dollars for the Cuban government as well as companies that do business in both Cuba and the United States.
American farmers complain that Washington has also tried to find ways to hinder agricultural sales to the island. Since the ban was lifted in 2000, an exception to the general trade embargo against Cuba, sales from American farmers to the island have risen to about $500 million a year, Cuban officials say.
But the Bush administration has required the purchases to be made in cash and, since 2004, that the payment must be received before shipment. The system has created immense logistical headaches for American shippers and food exporters. Loads of grain and poultry end up waiting for days on a dock until proof of payment arrives, shippers said. 
“There are lot of delays in loading because of that,” said Eric T. Junker, the owner of Americana Marine Services, which ships grain to the island.
President Bush and other supporters of the sanctions maintain that every dollar that enters Cuba helps support a despotic regime. In his speech on Oct. 24, Mr. Bush asked Congress to maintain the embargo and said the transfer of power from Fidel Castro, who has been ill, to his brother Raúl, amounted to “exchanging one dictator for another.” He called for elections after Fidel Castro’s death.
 Cuban officials argue the embargo hurts American farmers more than it does the government here. But they also acknowledge the American attempts to punish foreign companies for doing business here have hurt them in dozens of small ways, from limiting their ability to buy to certain medicines to making it impossible to get spare parts for scientific equipment. 
“The blockade makes doing business here insecure,” said Pedro Álvarez Borrego, the chairman of Alimport, the government-owned company that imports food. 
The biggest blow, however, has been to tourism. The minister for tourism, Manuel Madero, said that before Mr. Bush took office, about 80,000 Americans visited Cuba every year, usually going through Mexico or another country. He declined to give a number for the current year, but said it had been reduced to trickle.
Luis M. Morejón, who operates a small tour company, said he used to arrange tours for at least 30 Americans a year in the late 1990s. “Now this whole year I haven’t had one,” he said. 
I’VE been traveling my entire life. With parents like mine, I’m sure that’s no surprise. I was in Central Europe, the south of France and the Amalfi coast all before I was 6 years old. 
Now, traveling is part of my job. In the last year I’ve had day trips to almost everywhere in the United States, and I’ve been to Mexico, Bangkok, Shanghai, Ukraine, Moscow, India, Africa, Panama and Canada, just to name a few places. My passport is just under a half-inch thick, and I recently had to have more pages added. It took one official in Argentina about 10 minutes to look at the whole thing.
Before anyone thinks I’m just a big whiner, there are a few things you should know. I’m a road warrior like every other business traveler. I don’t travel first class. We’re too cheap, and try to save money where we can. That means I usually travel coach or business class. I try to upgrade when I can with frequent flier miles. But that’s been getting increasingly difficult. 
If I’m wearing a suit, folks have a tendency to recognize me more often, and it does create an awkward few minutes. Check-in officials or gate agents may want to ask me about my dad, which is great. But it’s not so great for people who are standing behind me. I can tell how restless people are getting by the degree of mumbling that I hear. So I generally just try to answer questions and then make a quick exit. 
I have learned to cope with airline security, check-ins and some inevitable questions. The first: “Is that your real name?” The second: “Are you related to that Trump?” Third: “How can I get on ‘The Apprentice?’” 
If a seatmate recognizes me, I usually just get asked the same questions as I do before I get on the flight. The problem is that you can’t make a quick exit.
By nature, I’m not a rude guy. So if someone asks me real estate questions, I do try to listen and give some insight, even if I’d just rather listen to my iPod, catch up on some reading or sleep.
Don’t think that a well-recognized name gets you any special treatment. I can’t keep my water bottle, either. And I almost missed a recent flight to Boston because of an alarm clock, a $20 Brookstone, that runs on one AA battery and was, ironically, bought at an airport kiosk a few months before. 
I had packed the little clock in my carry-on, and as my bag went thru the X-ray machine, the crack team of Transportation Security Administration agents took a look and concluded that my alarm clock was masquerading as a bomb.
 Obviously, in this day and age, security needs to be tight. But it was an alarm clock. Despite my best efforts in trying to explain the situation, security shut down the lane. I felt like an idiot. And by the way, no one much cared about what I had to say. 
The T.S.A. agents called in the state police. It took them only five minutes to figure out that I was indeed carrying an alarm clock. One of the officers spoke to the gate agent on my behalf, while I was being held, sockless and shoeless, in the screening line. The whole alarm clock affair took about 25 minutes.
Sometimes it pays to be a Trump. Frequent flying isn’t one of those times. But at least I got my alarm clock back. 
Alex Kovalev had two power-play goals, then scored again in the shootout last night as the Montreal Canadiens beat the host Toronto Maple Leafs, 4-3.
Toronto’s Mats Sundin scored his club-record 400th goal with 17.6 seconds left in the third period, but the Maple Leafs lost their fourth in a row.
In the shootout, Montreal’s Andrei Kostitsyn scored between Vesa Toskala’s legs, and Carey Price made a save against Jason Blake to win it in the fifth shootout round.
Guillaume Latendresse also scored in regulation for the Canadiens, and Darcy Tucker and Chad Kilger had goals for the Maple Leafs.
The Maple Leafs outshot Montreal, 46-30, but went 0 for 4 with the advantage compared to the Canadiens, who were 2 for 5 and own the N.H.L.’s top power-play unit.
RED WINGS 5, FLAMES 3 Pavel Datsyuk had two goals and an assist to lift host Detroit over Calgary.
Tomas Holmstrom added a goal and an assist, and Kris Draper and Valtteri Filppula also scored for Detroit. Nicklas Lidstrom had two assists, and Chris Osgood made 19 saves
Robyn Regehr, Dion Phaneuf, and Alex Tanguay scored for Calgary, and Jarome Iginla added three assists. Miikka Kiprusoff made 12 saves before being pulled early in the second period after giving up three goals.
Holmstrom gave Detroit a 3-1 lead with his N.H.L.-leading ninth power-play goal 4 minutes 36 seconds into the second period. With the Red Wings enjoying a two-man advantage, Holmstrom put a shot through Kiprusoff’s pads from the slot for his 13th goal.
Calgary Coach Mike Keenan then pulled Kiprusoff in favor of Curtis McElhinney.
Phaneuf cut the Flames’ deficit to one by scoring a five-on-three goal with 5:57 left in the second period. He beat Osgood from the high slot for his fifth goal.
Datsyuk’s second goal restored Detroit’s two-goal lead 37 seconds into the third period. After carrying the puck to the slot area from the neutral zone, Datsyuk lost it momentarily, but regained possession and backhanded a shot past McElhinney for his seventh goal of the season.
Tanguay made it 4-3 at 3:02 when he put in Iginla’s cross-crease pass to complete a two-on-one break for his sixth goal.
Filppula scored his fourth goal at 6:13.
FLYERS’ HARTNELL SUSPENDED Philadelphia forward Scott Hartnell was suspended for two games by the N.H.L., making him the fourth Flyers player disciplined by the league this season for illegal hits.
Hartnell checked Boston Bruins defenseman Andrew Alberts in the head Monday night and was given a major penalty for boarding. He was ejected in the second period of the Flyers’ 6-3 loss, and Alberts left the game with an unspecified head injury.
Colin Campbell, the league’s vice president for hockey operations, said that even though it appeared Hartnell was attempting to let up on the check, Alberts was in a “vulnerable position.”
“However, at the point of contact, he did deliver a blow to the head of Mr. Alberts that resulted in an injury,” Campbell said in a statement announcing the suspension.
After the game, Hartnell said: “I did not try to hurt him. There was no intent at all. I am not that type of player..”
A Scottish council rejected a plan by Donald Trump to build a golf course on a stretch of remote coastline that is home to some of the country’s rarest birds. After a debate lasting two and a half hours, Aberdeenshire Council’s Infrastructure Committee rejected plans for the Trump International Golf Links after a tie-breaking vote. A spokesman for Trump said he was looking at alternative sites in other European countries.
PORT SULPHUR, La., Dec. 4  The smell of gasoline fills the ruined gym each evening as a generator sputters to life. A string of bulbs provides thin lighting above the weight-lifting equipment that sits on a warped and abandoned basketball court. A makeshift dressing area for the South Plaquemines High football team spreads beneath one backboard, where floodwaters from Hurricane Katrina rose above the rim, 10 feet off the floor.
 Sometimes on Sundays, when football practice starts late, the players do not wait for the rumble of the generator. Stepping carefully, they find their lockers with the glow of cellphones. 
 “They chased a raccoon out of here once,” Sal Cepriano, a senior lineman, said.
 No one is complaining about the inconvenience and the occasional wandering critter. There will be plenty of bright lights and varmint-free locker space Saturday when South Plaquemines (12-2) plays for a Class 1A state championship in the Superdome, 45 miles north in New Orleans, completing a remarkable season of perseverance and indomitable spirit.
 Little has returned to normal in the two and a half years since Katrina destroyed the tiny fishing, oil and citrus villages of Port Sulphur, Buras, Boothville and Venice in lower Plaquemines Parish, where the Mississippi River runs to the Gulf of Mexico. Football has provided an important symbol of resilience and renewal along the southern end of this vital but isolated and vulnerable peninsula.
 “Football is the only thing that will bring this community together; there’s nothing else here,” said Corey Buie, an assistant coach and the recreation director of Plaquemines Parish.
 South Plaquemines, a consolidated school formed in 2006, plays football among Louisiana’s smallest high schools. It is located in temporary buildings on the wrecked campus of Port Sulphur High. Devastation from the storm has been reshaped into defiance. The team is called the Hurricanes, and campus walkways are named Hurricane Alley, Katrina Way and Rita Way.
 A year ago, the Hurricanes made the playoffs despite traveling 60 miles round trip to practice and lacking a locker room, a home field and even a school cafeteria for much of the season. This season brought higher expectations, and South Plaquemines responded with Louisiana’s most prolific quarterback, its leading receiver and one of its most resourceful running backs.
 Two hurricane seasons have come and gone quietly since Katrina brought its 28-foot storm surge. Perhaps half of the 3,000 prestorm residents and most of the small businesses have returned to Port Sulphur: the doughnut shop and the dollar stores, and Delta Drugs and the Cajun Kitchen. But this has been a double-wide recovery, almost everything in trailers or modular buildings, lending a feel of impermanence and uncertainty.
 A third of the team’s 38 players began the season still living in FEMA trailers. Mike Barthelemy, a freshman linebacker, sleeps on an air mattress as his family awaits its rebuilding grant from the state. Shane Dinette, a senior running back, commutes about 50 miles each way from the New Orleans suburb of Harvey, rather than live in a trailer behind his mother’s restaurant, five minutes from school.
 “Too depressing,” he said.
 Many nights after practice, Coach Cyril Crutchfield spends an hour on his school bus route, driving south to drop players in Buras and Boothville. The parish plans to relocate South Plaquemines High in Buras, but there is no school there now and little sign of recovery. Only the front steps remain to the home of Cantrell Riley, the state’s leading receiver. 
 The Buras fire station has no walls. The Delta Food Mart resembles a movie set with its skeletal facade. Curtains sway through blown-out windows of the library. Sixteen coffins remain unidentified at Our Lady of Good Harbor cemetery. They rest in cement vaults, strapped to the ground so they will not float away again in another storm.
 Highway 23 is the only road in and out of lower Plaquemines. The Mississippi flows behind one levee, and the gulf behind another. Katrina’s wrath is evident in the telephone poles that lean as if exhausted and in the arthritic trees shorn of leaves and branches.
 Every day, Crutchfield, who won a Class 1A state title at Port Sulphur High in 2002, sees the punch-drunk homes and staggered buildings and driveways that lead to nothing but cement slabs. This is why he feels such urgency to win Saturday against West St. John High, whose coach, Laury Dupont, is seeking to retire with a fourth championship.
 “Tomorrow is not guaranteed,” Crutchfield told his players. “We don’t know what will happen when the Gulf water turns warm and the wind starts to blow.”
 South Plaquemines has played ferociously, losing only to schools with four times its enrollment of about 190 students. The Hurricanes, who use a spread offense and an attacking defense, scored 60 points in the first quarter of their opening playoff game. Only once in their last 10 games have they scored fewer than 54 points.
 Ridge Turner, a junior quarterback, has set a state single-season record with 5,240 combined passing and rushing yards and has accounted for 64 touchdowns. This is more yardage than Terry Bradshaw, Peyton Manning or any other Louisiana high school quarterback produced in a season, and all of it was inadvertent.
 Until Katrina struck, Turner was a defensive back at Port Sulphur High. He became a quarterback only when the storm-tossed Randall Mackey moved 300 miles north to Bastrop, where he will play for a third consecutive Class 4A state championship Saturday (the first was revoked when Mackey was deemed to have been illegally recruited).
 The fact that Turner is playing at all is something of long shot. From age 6, he was reared by an aunt, Elouise Turner, as his mother battled drug addiction. Until then, Ridge said, he was sometimes left alone at night with his dog, Sandy, and by age 4 or 5 he learned to fry shrimp so that he would have something to fill his stomach.
 “His aunt is a saint; she saved Ridge,” said Wayne Williamson, a sheriff’s deputy whose son, Wayne Jr., is a defensive back. “There’s no telling where he would be.”
 Last season, Elouise Turner told Ridge he could no longer play football after he brought home a failing grade on a report card. She reconsidered, she said, because, “we already lost our home.” 
“Losing football would be losing everything,” she said. 
 Turner’s grades have improved, as has his ability to read defenses. His favorite receiver is Riley, a whippet-thin senior who was born with a left leg so bowed that the tibia had to be broken and reset. Some of his teammates call him Crazy Legs.
 On Oct. 19, Riley’s season appeared to be in jeopardy when he injured his right knee while returning a kickoff. An orthopedist examined him on the sideline and told Riley that he had a torn ligament and should remain inactive for four to six weeks.
 Riley stalked away, got a second opinion, bought a knee brace at a sporting goods store and kept playing. He finished the regular season with 57 receptions for 1,098 yards  both first in the state. Then, as the playoffs began, he considered quitting the team.
 Although three wrecked schools are now combined at South Plaquemines, rivalries persist at some level. Riley felt that players from Port Sulphur received too much praise, while those from Buras and Boothville were too often criticized or ignored.
 He and his mother spoke with Crutchfield, and the tension was defused. Also a cornerback, Riley has intercepted 10 passes in four playoff games. In a 56-6 semifinal victory last Friday, he caught two touchdown passes and made three interceptions. Afterward, Jeanitta Ancar, whose son Jordan is an offensive tackle, hugged Riley and said, “We love you no matter where you’re from.”
 Surely, the Hurricanes would not have reached the championship game without the Fitte brothers, who returned here last spring after attending schools in Belle Chasse in northern Plaquemines Parish. Lyle Fitte, a junior running back, has scored 46 touchdowns on rushes, receptions and kick returns. Beau Fitte is an all-league freshman defensive end. Evan Fitte, also a freshman, is a starting receiver. 
 “My mother didn’t want to come back at first,” Lyle Fitte said. “She thought the storms would get worse. But I wanted to bring my family together.”
 Lyle has lived in a trailer on his grandparents’ property, rising early several mornings a week to run sprints up the Mississippi River levee just beyond his door. Finally, last week, Habitat for Humanity presented the keys to his mother’s new home here.
 “You can move around down here,” Beau Fitte said. “Ride your four-wheeler, go hunting in the backyard. Maybe if we win the state championship, more people will come back.”
The origins of Darwin’s “Origin of Species” might not seem a promising subject for a stage play. But then who could have imagined that New York audiences would flock to a three-part epic about the history of Russian thought in the 19th century?
Peter Parnell’s “Trumpery,” which opened last night at the Atlantic Theater Company, does not aim for the epic breadth of Tom Stoppard’s grand opus on that meaty subject, or even the complexity of “Rock ’n’ Roll,” Mr. Stoppard’s current Broadway play about postwar Czechoslovak culture and politics. Instead “Trumpery” is a tightly focused study of Darwin, his family and his intellectual circles in the years just before and after the 1859 publication of his earth-shaking, faith-shattering book about natural selection.
Filled with talk about botany, genealogy and paleontology, the play naturally contains a few speeches that compare with the best — or is it the worst? — of Mr. Stoppard’s in the eye-glazing department. The heart does not race when Darwin jovially announces that a friend will be stopping by to discuss “the osteology of the ostrich.”
But like Mr. Stoppard, Mr. Parnell also manages to conjure unexpected jokes from the unlikeliest of subjects. Barnacles, for example. (Top that, Tom!) He also puts firm flesh on Darwin and his colleagues, who might have come across as fossils. While it is ultimately more admirable than exciting, “Trumpery” rarely feels like a simple lecture, or one of those stilted dramatic re-enactments used to enliven television documentaries of the pre-Ken Burns era. A stylish set by Santo Loquasto and rich costumes by Jane Greenwood certainly help. 
Mr. Parnell’s plot hinges on a joke of academic history. The writing of “The Origin of Species,” the play argues, derived from a sudden surge of competitive instinct on the part of its author. Distracted by worry and illness, Darwin had been unable to finish the book until he felt his life’s work and livelihood were in danger of being trumped, as it were, by the discoveries of another fellow. (Mr. Parnell drew on various histories of the era for the basic facts of the play but has done some fictionalizing and telescoping in the pursuit of both cogency and dramatic potency.)
Darwin, played by the excellent Michael Cristofer as a man of naturally gentle, even diffident disposition, is mired in the middle of his book when he receives a friendly but disturbing letter from a fellow naturalist and sometime correspondent, Alfred Russel Wallace (Manoel Felciano). Wallace too has hit upon the theory of the evolution of species. Fearing the outcry it would inevitably cause, Darwin had been toiling quietly for years, meticulously collecting evidence to support his thesis. Now, before he can publish, he sees the glory being snatched away.
The question of what to do about the pesky Wallace — conveniently off in the distant Moluccan Islands — recedes to the background, however, as Mr. Parnell spends much of the first act filling in the contours of Darwin’s troubled home life and tracing the basics of his theory.
Darwin’s wife, Emma (the fine Bianca Amato), is dismayed by his loss of faith, and even more saddened by his apparent encouragement of atheistic tendencies in their children, particularly a terminally ill daughter, Annie (Paris Rose Yates). This subplot would perhaps benefit from lighter treatment, like an easement of Annie’s precocious eloquence. “If nothing comes to pass without the will of God, why then does he allow pain and suffering?” she asks plaintively. 
Darwin sets aside the family troubles when his fellow scientists — his ally Hooker (Michael Countryman), the aggressive Huxley (Neal Huff) and the reactionary Owen (Peter Maloney) — gather round the teapot for a testy chat about the presence or absence of God, and just how instrumental Darwin’s book might be in making the old fellow obsolete.
The second act complicates the picture, as Wallace arrives, after Darwin has published and become the toast (or the bane) of Victorian England. Here Mr. Parnell widens the focus to include discussion of the supernatural. Wallace and Emma are both believers in communication with the spirit world, and a séance takes place that seems, at first, to shake Darwin’s disbelief. Guilt over usurping Wallace’s renown and anguish at the loss of his daughter lead Darwin to the edge of despair, from which he is rescued by Wallace himself.
This climactic encounter, unfortunately, is overwritten and overexplicit. As Darwin and Wallace trade ideas about the nature of mankind and propound personal credos, they begin to sound increasingly, well, pontifical.
“The plain truth is, your cockeyed idealism has saved you,” Darwin says. “What you have come to discover about the world, about life, has made you happy. What I have discovered about the world has made me sad.” 
Wallace says: “Why not try and take comfort, Charles, in the fact that there is so much even you cannot control. For you, like the rest of us, are, finally, only human.” 
Under the sensitive direction of David Esbjornson, both Mr. Felciano and Mr. Cristofer bring layers of real feeling to these culminating thoughts, but they still feel a bit like the overly tailored work of a dramatist imposing a clean, calculated order on the unruly business of natural life. Which happens, of course, to be the focus of their discussion.

WANTAGH, N.Y., Dec. 6  Donald J. Trump exercises his usual restraint in describing Trump on the Ocean, the 100,000-square-foot restaurant and catering hall he is building at Jones Beach State Park. It exists at “the best corner of Jones Beach,” or, for the more citified, at the “57th and Fifth of Jones Beach.”
That may be, though there are complaints that Mr. Trump has come up with an odd mixture of Palm Beach aesthetic and Atlantic City commercialization.
For right now, the building is simply waiting. 
Mr. Trump began planning the restaurant, his first project on state land, in 2006. During the last year, the undertaking has been marked by wrangling over such things as the size of his name on the facade and environmental permits. And the wrangling has led to sporadic outbursts: Mr. Trump has railed against government bureaucracy, traded insults with local officials and endured “Dump Trump” demonstrations by nearby residents who say his glossy marketing campaign cheapens an iconic public amenity. 
No sooner did Mr. Trump begin the foundation for the restaurant, on the site of the old 49,800-square-foot Boardwalk Restaurant, than he had to stop work. Officials told him he needed additional variances and permits from the state to build a basement. 
“It’s just ridiculous  I’ve been waiting for three weeks to build,” he said in an interview on Wednesday. “You don’t let us start a construction job and then tell us later, ‘By the way, we need more permits.’ My pile driver gave up three other jobs to start this and now he’s calling me asking why he can’t start.”
But Eileen Larrabee, a spokeswoman for the State Office of Parks, Recreation and Historic Preservation, said Mr. Trump was aware of the necessary permits and that the contract required him to comply at his own expense. 
“The Trump Organization does have lawyers, contractors and engineers that are familiar with these types of permits,” Ms. Larrabee said. “This was all in the contract, that they’re responsible for all permits.”
The vast new hall, which Mr. Trump says will cost more than $30 million, is to include a formal 350-seat restaurant as well as space for catered events accommodating 2,000 people, officials at the Trump Organization said. Valet parking and concierge service will also be provided. 
Not everyone is enthralled. The chairman of the Nassau County Board of Assessors, Harvey B. Levinson, called Mr. Trump’s project at the renowned oceanfront park, created by Robert Moses in 1929, a “raping of the beach.” 
As Mr. Levinson put it, state officials “got blinded by his hairdo” and celebrity status and handed Mr. Trump a sweetheart deal that will shortchange local municipalities about $1 million and indulge the wealthy over the middle class.
“A place that offers $250-a-plate events does not serve the public purpose,” he said.
In turn, Mr. Trump has repeatedly proclaimed Mr. Levinson a self-promoting “loser.”
There is also the clash of the notoriously glittery Trump aesthetic with the public mission and traditional Art Deco style of the park’s two bathhouses and landmark water tower. Mr. Trump agreed to use limestone for the restaurant, but his choice of a polished variety, critics say, does not conform to the general rough-hewn look of other park buildings. “It has a more luxurious look, a softer finish,” Mr. Trump said. “I want it to be gorgeous and they don’t want it to be gorgeous.”
Then there is the clash over the Trump name, which the developer envisioned writ large on the 28-foot-tall building. In one rendering, the name seemed to glisten in letters that were four feet tall. But state officials said the size violated the beach’s longstanding sign limitations and moved to reduce them to less than two feet in height, which enraged Mr. Trump.
“My name adds tremendous value,” he said. “If it didn’t have my name up there, the project wouldn’t even work and wouldn’t be the success it is. We’re signing people up right and left, for weddings, bar mitzvahs and other events.”
Mr. Trump’s deal was negotiated during the administration of Gov. George E. Pataki, whose parks commissioner, Bernadette Castro, is a friend of Mr. Trump’s and who called the project “a gift from God” for her agency. 
But Ms. Castro’s successor, Carol Ash, has been less effusive and more stringent in holding Mr. Trump to particulars, including incorporating environmental elements into the design, and redesigning the hall so that restaurant patrons as well as catering clients can enjoy the ocean views. Mr. Trump lamented that Mr. Moses, the imperious master builder, never faced such problems.
“In the days of Moses, you didn’t have all these environmental impact statements and community boards,” he said. “Getting something approved was 500 percent quicker. If you wanted to build Jones Beach today, they’d have you arrested for interfering with the sand movement.
“Listen, it’s a very small job for me, and I have other places to invest $40 million,” he said.
Mr. Trump began marketing the Jones Beach restaurant this summer at Hamptons polo matches, and has already booked events on the assumption that building will be finished by March 2009, though now, he said, he has had to cancel some.
“The state is building up damages,” he warned. “We’re canceling weddings for every day they’re delaying us.”
Ms. Larrabee said the contract “clearly came from a prior administration, and where the new commissioner could get improvements  like making sure it is green-certified or ensure that the public customers will have views of the ocean and not the parking lot  she will make sure they adhere to the contract, on behalf of the public.”
Mr. Trump and his partner in the project, Steven Carl, a Long Island caterer, are leasing the property from the state for 40 years, and must pay an annual rent of $200,000 and a percentage of gross receipts after it has been operating three years.
Mr. Levinson said they were not required to pay local property taxes because they are building on state land, so the local school district and the fire department charged with responding to emergencies at the park will not benefit. Mr. Levinson sees this as unjust and is calling for the state and Mr. Trump to make a payment in lieu of taxes to the village of Wantagh. 
Asked about the claims, Mr. Trump said, “He’s an idiot  why didn’t this loser come forward earlier with his complaints?”
For his part, Mr. Levinson responded, “I’d expect to hear that from an 11-year-old, not a sophisticated developer.
“Jones Beach is meant for the middle class and Donald Trump is commercializing Jones Beach,” he said. “I’m sure Robert Moses is turning over in his grave.”
To the Editor:
Richard E. Nisbett (“All Brains Are the Same Color,” Op-Ed, Dec. 9) does the black-white I.Q. debate a service by adroitly picking apart hereditarians’ arguments.
What’s always odd about I.Q. discussions, however, is that I.Q. is used synonymously with intelligence. It’s pretty hard to argue that on average blacks aren’t as smart as whites without really knowing what intelligence is or what I.Q. tests measure.
I.Q. tests were created in the early 1900s before scientists had sufficient understanding of the brain or genetics. They were cobbled together with no real intelligence theory  developed and adapted to test children in French classrooms, immigrants at Ellis Island and soldiers in the Army during World War I  and they have changed very little over time. 
If we want intelligence tests, we need to devise new ones based on actual scientific theory rather than Victorian and Progressive Era puffery. Until then, at the very least, we should have a healthy agnosticism about who is smarter than whom.

To the Editor:
As Richard E. Nisbett shows, the evidence now indicates that the black-white gap is environmental in origin and can be reduced through environmental influences. The most recent evidence on this point comes from the long-term trend data from the National Assessment of Educational Progress (the nation’s report card).
Between the early 1970s and 2004, the reading and math scores of black children have risen faster than the scores for white children. Among 9-year-olds, black children have closed more than a third of the black-white gap that existed in the early 1970s. Progress has also been made by 13-year-olds and 17-year-olds.
Changes in genetic endowment cannot explain these gains over time. Rather, the narrowing of the gaps suggests that improvements in home and school environments play causal roles.

To the Editor:
I.Q. is not an inherent trait  it is an invention that measures how much a person knows within one’s cultural context, which is why the environment makes such a profound difference in one’s score.
I.Q. tests are notoriously biased against anyone who is not white, male and middle class. Numerous studies have shown that it is not a valid measure of intelligence and, indeed, even white people who come from other cultures score poorly on the tests.
The idea that psychologists are still trying to find racial differences in I.Q. scores is maddening. Moreover, we know that there are far more genetic differences within races than between them.
The real point of interest is why people do this research in the first place. These studies tell us nothing about intelligence, black people, white people, genetics or environment. What they really show is the inherent racism of the ones doing the research.

To the Editor:
Having seen many brains at autopsy and in teaching labs, I can confirm the statement that “All Brains Are the Same Color.” But the discussion of genetic determination of intellectual capacity falls short of the mark.
It is not the genetic DNA in a cell that determines what a cell is and how it performs; it is, rather, which genes are turned on and when. Turning a gene on or off can be controlled by a wide variety of factors in life: toxins, learning, disease, hormones, drugs, diet  the list is numberless. 
We now know enough about the fine structure of the brain, the proteins involved and the roles they play in learning, cognition, memory and other components of intelligence to understand that the DNA of genes are, generally, many steps removed from determining these capacities. Any study of the genetics of possible racial differences in intelligence must be based not on genes but on knowledge of the fine structure and proteins of the brain. These can provide objective, quantifiable measures.
Such a study must also be conducted on groups that have been rigorously matched on the basis of all the factors that can affect gene expression and protein production and processing, like age, gender, environment, diet, drug and toxin exposure  a daunting, if not impossible, task.

To the Editor:
As heartening as I found Richard E. Nisbett’s arguments against a correlation between race and intelligence, I find it difficult to overlook the fact that one of the world’s most eminent scientists, James D. Watson, recently lost his job for taking the opposite position.
Under such circumstances, essays like Professor Nisbett’s take on the air of dogma. One is left to wonder what researchers might find or say if their careers and reputations weren’t threatened by academic McCarthyism.

To the Editor:
Perhaps Richard E. Nisbett’s report on studies that show the effect of environment on I.Q. scores has provided an answer to a question I have pondered for many years. When I was in high school, I scored 115 on an I.Q. test, but when I had another I.Q. test many years later, I scored over 130. Why the increase?
My skin color hadn’t changed, but my environment certainly had. I grew up in a small town with a father who had dropped out of school in the sixth grade and a mother who was the only one of six children who graduated from high school.
When I took the second I.Q. test some 30 years later, I was living in Baltimore because my husband was a tenured professor at Johns Hopkins University. I had just completed a master’s degree and was thinking of applying for admission to a doctoral program.

It is a classic tale of reinvention, American style.
Born in the Soviet Union in 1966, Felix H. Sater immigrated with his family to Brighton Beach when he was 8 years old. At 24 he was a successful Wall Street broker, at 27 he was in prison after a bloody bar fight, and at 32 he was accused of conspiring with the Mafia to launder money and defraud investors.
Along the way he became embroiled in a plan to buy antiaircraft missiles on the black market for the Central Intelligence Agency in either Russia or Afghanistan, depending on which of his former associates is telling the story.
But in recent years Mr. Sater has resurfaced with a slightly different name and a new business card identifying him as a real estate executive based on Fifth Avenue. And although he may not be a household name, one of the people he is doing business with is: Donald J. Trump.
Mr. Sater  who now goes by the name Satter  has been jetting to Denver, Phoenix, Fort Lauderdale, Fla., and elsewhere since 2003, promoting potential projects in partnership with Mr. Trump and others. In New York, the company Mr. Sater works for, Bayrock Group, is a partner in the Trump SoHo, a sleek, 46-story glass tower condominium hotel under construction on a newly fashionable section of Spring Street.
But much remains unknown about Mr. Sater, 41, and determining the truth about his past is a bit like unraveling the plot of a spy novel: Almost every character tells a different tale. 
A federal complaint brought against him in a 1998 money laundering and stock manipulation case was filed in secret and remains under seal. A subsequent indictment in March 2000 stemming from the same investigation described Mr. Sater as an “unindicted co-conspirator” and a key figure in a $40 million scheme involving 19 stockbrokers and organized crime figures from four Mafia families. 
The indictment asserted that Mr. Sater helped create fraudulent stock brokerages that were used to defraud investors and launder money. Mr. Sater and his lawyer, Judd Burstein, repeatedly refused to discuss in detail his role in the stock scam.
But a onetime friend, Gennady Klotsman, who is known as Gene and who was accused with Mr. Sater as a co-conspirator, contends that they both pleaded guilty in 1998, and that Mr. Sater began cooperating with the authorities. Prosecutors are unwilling to discuss either the 1998 complaint or the 2000 indictment. 
“I’m not proud of some of the things that happened in my 20s,” Mr. Sater said in an interview. “I am proud of the things I’m doing now.”
Mr. Sater, who has an untitled position at Bayrock, said he started spelling his name as Satter to “distance himself from a past” in an age when anyone can look up a name on Google. But he continues to use the name Sater on the deed to his house on Long Island.
Mr. Burstein added, “He does not hide his past, and difficulties he had, from anybody he does business with.”
But Alex Sapir, president of the Sapir Organization, a partner in Trump SoHo, said he was “not happy” to have just learned of Mr. Sater’s past on Thursday. “This is all news to me,” he said. 
Mr. Trump also said he was surprised to learn of Mr. Sater’s past. “We never knew that,” he said of Mr. Sater. “We do as much of a background check as we can on the principals. I didn’t really know him very well.” 
Mr. Trump said that most of his dealings with Bayrock had been with its founder, Tevfik Arif, and that his son Donald and his daughter Ivanka were playing active roles in managing the project. Neither Bayrock nor Mr. Trump has been accused of wrongdoing.
Mr. Sater has generally kept a low profile on the Trump projects, although he mingled with guests and the owners at the September party introducing Trump SoHo. Mr. Trump and Mr. Sater were also together in Loveland, Colo., in 2005, where they were interviewed by a reporter for The Rocky Mountain News about potential development deals in nearby Denver. Mr. Trump said he did not recall Mr. Sater’s being there.
“They seemed to get along just fine,” said Justin Henderson, a Denver developer who worked with Mr. Trump and Mr. Sater on an ultimately unsuccessful deal to build the tallest towers in Colorado. “It seemed that Mr. Trump relied heavily on Mr. Sater’s opinion on certain markets.”
Mr. Sater’s latest transformation could prove to be a cautionary tale for Mr. Trump, who has carefully molded his image into an international brand that has extended from real estate to bottled water, men’s suits, steaks, vodka, a television show and, in his latest invention, the Trump Hotel Collection.
The hotel collection, a hotel management company, includes two projects with Bayrock: Trump SoHo and Trump International Hotel and Tower in Fort Lauderdale. A third joint project, in Phoenix, is also in the works.
“Trump is a name associated with a certain cachet and bravado, I suppose, that will attract certain kinds of people,” said Rita Rodriguez, chief executive of the Brand Union, a corporate branding and identity agency. 
“The brand is a strategic and financial asset,” she said. “It has to be taken care of very similarly to any other asset you have on your balance sheet. Anything that would detract from that could jeopardize the brand impression the brand makes.”
Mr. Sater was born in the Soviet Union, the son of Rachel and Mikhail Sater, according to public records, court testimony and the federal indictment. He has said his parents, who are Jewish, moved first to Israel, then to Baltimore and finally to New York in the early 1970s to escape “religious persecution.”
Mr. Sater was born Haim Felix Sater, but he once testified in court that he “Americanized” his name to Felix Henry Sater in the early 1990s. 
Mr. Sater took classes at Pace University but dropped out at 18 to work at Bear Stearns. Like Mr. Klotsman, he rose quickly, moving from firm to firm selling stock.
Mr. Sater’s first brush with the law came in 1991. Mr. Sater and Mr. Klotsman were at El Rio Grande, a Midtown watering hole, celebrating with a friend and eventual co-conspirator, Salvatore Lauria, who had just passed his stockbroker’s exam.
Mr. Sater later told a judge that he was in a good mood, having made a quick $3,000 in commissions that day. But he got into an argument with a commodities broker at the bar, and it quickly escalated. According to the trial transcript, Mr. Sater grabbed a large margarita glass, smashed it on the bar and plunged the stem into the right side of the broker’s face. The man suffered nerve damage and required 110 stitches to close the laceration on his face.
“I got into a bar fight over a girl neither he nor I knew,” Mr. Sater said in an interview. “My life spiraled out of control.” Mr. Sater was convicted at trial in 1993, went to prison and was effectively barred from selling securities by the National Association of Securities Dealers.
But according to the 2000 federal indictment in the fraud case, Mr. Sater, Mr. Klotsman, Mr. Lauria and their partners gained control in 1993 of White Rock Partners, which later changed its name to State Street Capital Markets. Although the companies “held themselves out as legitimate brokerage firms,” the indictment states, “they were in fact operated for the primary purpose of earning money through fraud involving the manipulation of the prices of securities.”
The trio would secretly gain control of large blocks of stock and warrants in four companies through offshore accounts, the indictment said. In an illegal “pump and dump” scheme, they would inflate the value of the shares through under-the-table payoffs to brokers who sold the securities to unsuspecting investors by spreading false information about the companies. Brokers were prohibited from acting on sell orders from investors unless they found another buyer, the indictment said.
The partners would then sell large blocks of stock at a steep profit. Investors suffered substantial losses as share prices plummeted. Despite the prohibition against selling securities, a subsequent complaint by regulators at the N.A.S.D. recounted how Mr. Sater “cursed, yelled and screamed” at the firm’s brokers in an attempt to motivate them. He also offered cash rewards to brokers who sold the largest block of house stocks.
At the same time, Mr. Sater, Mr. Lauria and others sought protection and help from members of the Mafia in resolving disputes with “pump and dump” firms operated by other organized crime groups. In 1995, for instance, Edward Garafola, a soldier in the Gambino crime family, sought to extort money from Mr. Sater. Mr. Sater, in turn, got Ernest Montevecchi, a soldier in the Genovese crime family, to persuade Mr. Garafola to back off, according to the indictment. 
The denouement of Mr. Sater’s career on Wall Street began in 1998 at a locker at a Manhattan Mini Storage in SoHo, where investigators discovered two pistols, a shotgun and a gym bag stuffed with a trove of documents outlining the money laundering scheme and offshore accounts of Mr. Sater and his partners. According to a law enforcement official, as well as Mr. Klotsman and another defendant in the case, Mr. Sater had rented the locker and then neglected to pay the rent. Mr. Sater denied having anything to do with the locker or the guns.
At the time investigators opened the storage locker, Mr. Sater and Mr. Klotsman had gone to Russia, where their wheeling and dealing continued, they said. Their most interesting stories, however, are hard to assess.
Mr. Sater and Mr. Klotsman tried to cut a deal with the C.I.A., according to a book co-written by Mr. Lauria, “The Scorpion and the Frog: High Times and High Crimes.” In exchange for leniency, the book said, they offered to buy a dozen missiles that Osama bin Laden had placed on the black market. The deal later collapsed. 
Mr. Lauria has since renounced his book, which also details the false stock brokerage scheme, calling it largely a work of fiction. He even tried unsuccessfully to block publication. However, his co-author, David S. Barry, said he documented all the stories in the book with records and other interviews.
Mr. Klotsman said that Mr. Sater did obtain information for the United States about another set of black-market missiles, and that those efforts “bought Felix his freedom” from prison. 
Mr. Sater, Mr. Klotsman and Mr. Lauria eventually returned to New York. Mr. Klotsman and Mr. Lauria agreed to cooperate with the United States attorney’s office in Brooklyn and pleaded guilty to racketeering charges in connection with the fraudulent stock brokerages, other defendants and lawyers in Mr. Sater’s case said. The information they provided helped prosecutors obtain guilty pleas from all 19 of their former cohorts, including six with ties to the mob.
Mr. Klotsman and his lawyer assert that Mr. Sater also pleaded guilty and cooperated. “Felix was one of the significant participants in the fraud,” the lawyer, Alexi M. Schacht, said.
Mr. Klotsman, who grew up with Mr. Sater, now lives in a $600-a-month apartment in Moscow. In an interview, he said he was paying the American government $625 a month in restitution for the $40 million lost by investors. He questioned whether Mr. Sater was paying a dime.
But Mr. Sater and his lawyer, Mr. Burstein, avoided many questions concerning his legal problems involving the Wall Street scam, including whether he pleaded guilty and cooperated. “I challenge you to find any official government document anywhere demonstrating his indictment or conviction for any crime other than the assault,” Mr. Burstein said. 
Mr. Sater said he joined Bayrock in 2003 at the urging of the company’s founder, Mr. Arif. A neighbor of Mr. Sater’s in Sands Point, on Long Island, Mr. Arif is a former economist for the Soviet government who built a chain of five luxury hotels in Turkey and Kazakhstan after the collapse of the Soviet Union. 
Within a stone’s throw of the Manhattan Mini Storage building, the Trump SoHo is rising rapidly at the corner of Spring and Varick Streets, another new glass tower amid the somewhat grubby industrial buildings of what had been the city’s printing district. The tower has generated opposition from some local residents and preservationists.
It is, for Mr. Sater, an emblem of his new life. “I’m trying to lead an exemplary existence,” he said. “Old, bad luggage is not something anyone wants to remember.”
Given the furor he feared it would unleash, it is not surprising that Charles Darwin sat on his “great idea,” refusing to publish “The Origin of Species” until 1859, more than 20 years after he first devised the theory of evolution.
“If I finish the book, I’m a killer,” he said. “I murder God.” 
At least that’s what Peter Parnell has Darwin say in his new play, “Trumpery,” which opened this month at the Atlantic Theater Company in New York.
In the play, as in real life, Darwin is moved to publish by Alfred Russel Wallace, a young man whom Parnell’s Darwin dismisses as “a nobody, a collector, a poor specimen hunter,” but who has independently come up with a theory just like the one Darwin has been chewing on for decades.
So in part the play hangs on scientific “priority:” who will publish first? As the action begins, Wallace, as in real life, has sent Darwin a paper describing his ideas, in hopes that Darwin will help make them known. (If, like many people, you know who Darwin is but not Wallace, you probably think you know how that comes out. Think again.)
But a larger question, Mr. Parnell said in an interview, is “what it means to be a scientist” when confronting issues of faith. It is an idea as controversial today as it was then.
Darwin’s Britain teemed with religiosity as diverse as evangelical Christian fervor and spiritualism, an idea whose adherents included Wallace and Darwin’s wife, Emma Wedgwood. Darwin knew he would be called heretical for challenging the Biblical idea of God as a one-time-only creator of an immutable natural order.
At first, he finds the idea literally sickening. But, as Mr. Parnell put it, Darwin is “both great enough and grandiose enough” to eventually conclude not just that he could do it, but that he ought to. And we all know how that came out.
 But today as then, there are creationists who assert that people must choose between belief in Darwin’s theory and belief in God. Yet Darwin did not kill God. His theory, unchallenged in science, is the foundation on which the edifice of modern biology is built. And it has plenty of adherents among religious believers.
“Trumpery” is not the first foray into science for Mr. Parnell, a screenwriter and dramatist who has worked on television shows like “The West Wing” and who teaches television writing at the Yale School of Drama. That would be “QED,” a play about Richard Feynman, the physicist and theorist of quantum electrodynamics, the modern theory of electromagnetism. 
It was while working on that play that Mr. Parnell stumbled on a book, “The Song of the Dodo” by David Quammen, which describes Wallace’s work. The book led Mr. Parnell to more study of Darwin, Wallace and their times. Pretty soon, he had a three-act play with, he realized, a cast of way too many characters dealing with way too many subjects  not just evolution, but topics like Colonialism and a Tierra del Fuegan accused of murder.
“I didn’t know for a long time what the play was about,” he said.
But just as “QED” focused sharply on Feynman, Mr. Parnell found this play by focusing on Darwin and telescoping some of the events in his life to bring his quandaries into sharp relief.
For example, much of the play is an argument involving Darwin, his biological allies Joseph Hooker and Thomas Henry Huxley, and their foe, Richard Owen. In fact, their debates took place in letters. But confrontation is useful for a dramatist dealing with science. 
“The ideas have to be accurate, they have to be intelligible,” Mr. Parnell said. “But you have to find a dramatic way to tell it  a reason it can be a play, to exist on stage.”
He added, “It has to be grounded in conflict.”
“Trumpery” is not Mr. Parnell’s first exploration of a frightening idea either. That was “And Tango Makes Three,” a children’s book he wrote with his partner, Justin Richardson. The book tells the true story of Silo and Roy, two male penguins at the Central Park Zoo who courted each other and formed a relationship. When a keeper saw them trying to incubate a rock, he gave them an orphaned egg, which they cared for until it hatched as the chick Tango.
While the book received many favorable reviews, some parents and religious groups objected to it as suggesting that a family could be something other than Mom, Dad and kids.
“That idea is considered dangerous,” Mr. Parnell said.
Today, although Darwin’s idea is not so frightening to many, the conflict over evolution still plays on, on stage and in school boards and courtrooms around the country. Perhaps conflict is inevitable when people confront new and frightening ideas. But, as Darwin tells his dying daughter Annie, at the end of the play, it is good to challenge conventional wisdom. He adds, though, “if you question everything, you have to expect to be scared.” 
WASHINGTON  It was a picture-perfect start for Nancy Pelosi as she took the speaker’s podium last January in her tailored aubergine suit surrounded by children to emphasize her singular status as the first woman, mother and grandmother to lead the House.
What Ms. Pelosi did not know, as she beamed at her fellow Democrats cheering their return to power, was that the glum Republicans witnessing the tableau would remain persistently unified against her and her ambitious new majority in the legislative year ahead. 
Defying expectations and surprising even themselves, Republicans were able to slow and sometimes halt Democratic momentum by refusing to break with President Bush and his war strategy, no matter how unpopular, and by resisting social initiatives, no matter how appealing. 
“What is interesting to me is how the Republicans have stuck with the president,” said Ms. Pelosi, of California, looking back on her history-making first year capped by the president signing an energy bill that she declared as a top priority from the start. “I didn’t foresee that.”
Republicans say their unity was inspired by what they saw as Democratic overreaching on policy, bolstered by a fundamental belief that a Congressionally forced withdrawal from Iraq would be disastrous, and stiffened by attacks on vulnerable members from outside advocacy groups. 
Holding together, they exerted their influence in three main areas: a children’s health care bill, domestic spending and, first and foremost, the war in Iraq. Time and again, even when a few of their number defected, they refused to provide the votes needed to challenge the president’s handling of the war. As a result, the final House vote of the year handed Mr. Bush another $70 billion for combat operations in Iraq and Afghanistan, much to the frustration of Democrats who had begun 2007 with enormous expectations.
“I was much more hopeful and optimistic that we would be able to do more to bring a new direction to this war, with our majority in the House and Senate,” said Representative John Lewis, the Georgia Democrat often viewed as the conscience of the party.
As they left the Capitol, Congressional Republicans took the view that they had been able to leverage their minority status to a degree even they had not thought possible.
“A year into ‘the wilderness,’ our Republican team has scored legislative and political victories that no one  no one  could have predicted a year ago,” Representative John A. Boehner of Ohio, the Republican leader, wrote in a confidential memorandum distributed to Republican House members.
Democrats predicted that Republicans would pay a steep price in 2008 for their conduct in 2007 while Democrats would take advantage of their own victories on kitchen-table issues like worker pay and education costs. 
As they face the voters in a presidential election year, Republicans will have to explain their loyalty to Mr. Bush’s war policies when polls have been clear for months about public dissatisfaction with the war. Even the relatively positive military trends that some see in Iraq have not, so far, produced much in the way of social stability there.
Democrats will remind voters at every turn that Republicans fought the expansion of health insurance for children and higher federal spending on biomedical research, college aid and an entire spectrum of federal programs. 
“Many are paying and will continue to pay a price, but they are standing by the president and their most conservative base,” said Senator Richard J. Durbin of Illinois, the No. 2 Democrat in the Senate. “The general polling across the country suggests this will not work in November.”
As Democrats asserted their new power at the start of the year, they raced ahead in the House with a series of initiatives on the minimum wage, higher education, terrorism, health care and energy, often with solid bipartisan support, giving hope that they might be able to attract Republicans. 
But the early action also foreshadowed problems that would hinder the new majority all year: the Senate, with its minority-empowering rules, was not on the same hurry-up schedule, and House Republicans bristled at what they considered heavy-handed treatment. “Overreaching and the exclusion of Republicans  that formula equals a lack of results,” said Representative Dave Camp, Republican of Michigan.
The first serious collision with Republicans and Mr. Bush came in the spring when Democrats first tried to condition $120 billion in war spending on a deadline for withdrawal. Initially they were able to push the measure through with minimal Republican support, but when it was vetoed, they fell far short of the margin needed for an override. 
Unwilling to be accused of depriving the troops of funds, they stripped the withdrawal provision. It was a pattern repeated throughout the year. At different points, Republicans seemed poised to bolt from Mr. Bush on the war  and other issues  but held firm.
On another national security issue, Democrats caved to administration pressure on terror surveillance before a summer break. Ms. Pelosi allowed the House to approve a temporary extension of a wiretapping program even though she considered the proposal constitutionally flawed and felt that the White House had dishonestly accused Democrats of impeding surveillance. “That was a sad day,” she said. “Sometimes it is just a fight where we don’t have a similar platform.” 
The solidarity of House Republicans was also on display in a long-running fight over proposals to expand the Children’s Health Insurance Program, a top priority for Ms. Pelosi and other Democratic leaders. On Sept. 28, one day after a child health bill cleared Congress for the first time, Democrats mapped out a strategy to override Mr. Bush’s promised veto.
Democrats and their allies held rallies, broadcast television commercials and made hundreds of telephone calls. They focused initially on 15 House Republicans, many from swing districts and suburban areas. They predicted that most of these lawmakers would switch sides and support the bill. But none did.
As the spending bills that finance federal agencies stalled, partly because of a long Senate immigration debate that ended without producing major legislation, Republicans joined Mr. Bush in insisting that Democrats not exceed the White House’s spending limit. Democratic leaders, who by and large earned their spurs on the appropriation committees, kept waiting for Mr. Bush to cut a deal. But the White House was spoiling for a fight. 
“The president as we all know, I can verify this for sure, has been eager all year to veto bills sent to his desk,” Representative Roy Blunt of Missouri, the No. 2 Republican, said Thursday.
Though Democrats had to settle for Mr. Bush’s spending figure, they rewrote parts of the $555 billion spending package to suit their own priorities. And they said that by passing the budget measure, they succeeded where Republicans could not in 2006, while depriving Republicans of the clash they wanted.
Heading into 2008, Republicans say they know they cannot campaign without a more positive agenda than simply thwarting Democrats. Republicans say they are putting together their own proposals on health care and the economy to present to the public. 
“I think it’s incumbent upon us to provide solutions to their concerns,” Mr. Boehner said, “but solutions built on our principles.”
Democrats have their own plans. Ms. Pelosi and others say they will revisit elements of the energy legislation that they had to jettison to get the new law enacted. They will have a health care push and major economic legislation to counter the possibility of a looming recession. They will keep the pressure on over Iraq, though the speaker indicated that she might focus more on policy questions and less on money for troops. 
And Democrats will try to paint Republicans as the problem. “But for the president and the Bush Republicans in the Senate,” said Senator Harry Reid of Nevada, the majority leader, “we could have accomplished so much more.” 
LOOKING almost demure in a tailored gray coat, Ivanka Trump stepped onto a makeshift stage to greet the construction crew at Trump SoHo, a new condominium and hotel in downtown Manhattan. The occasion, a topping-off party to celebrate the project’s near completion, was raucous. 
“We love you, Ivanka,” one of the workmen bellowed between man-size bites of sausage, his shout followed by a chorus of “Ivanka, you’re the best.”
No stranger to that sort of overwrought reception, Ms. Trump, the daughter of the real estate magnate Donald Trump, received the homage with aplomb. She stood to thank the men, well aware that her understated coat did little to conceal her curves or dim the sheen of the Champagne-color hair that cascaded past her shoulders. 
Just a few hours earlier at her office in Trump Tower on Fifth Avenue, she had acknowledged that there are distinct advantages to “being young, blond and, if you will, looking a certain way.” 
“I’m 26,” Ms. Trump said, “and I tell myself, ‘Why not have a little fun with that?’ ” 
Seeing her swan alongside Mr. Trump on “The Apprentice,” or vamp demiclad in the pages of a fashion magazine, an observer could be forgiven for sizing her up as a bit of garnish on her father’s multilayered business operation. If they do, “That’s O.K.,” Ms. Trump said evenly. Seated somewhat rigidly in a fan-backed leather chair, she pointed out that it is she, after all, who will have the last word. 
“As a principal of this company, I negotiate all the deals I’m working on,” she said. “If people think I’m just the boss’s daughter, they’re deceived.” 
Clearly, Ms. Trump has inherited her father’s prodigious flair for self-promotion. On the face of it, Mr. Trump rules a real estate empire of 70 properties. But in some ways, he is the Pierre Cardin of the real estate world, a licensing pioneer who has sold the right to use his name on dozens of luxury projects, charging 8 to 15 percent of the gross, according to Forbes magazine, which calculates his net worth as $3 billion. (Mr. Trump, who disputes the Forbes ranking, says the figure is $7 billion.)
Ms. Trump is just as able a master of self-packaging. Her father’s daughter to the bone, she says she has harnessed her energies  to say nothing of television guest spots on “Oprah” and “Project Runway” and nights on the town on the arm of Jared Kushner, the real estate heir and publisher  in service of the Trump brand. 
Then there are her exuberant displays of thigh and cleavage in the laddie book Stuff, and in Arena, the progressive British glossy. In October’s Harper’s Bazaar, she was photographed reclining in a dress slit to her thighs, a burly half-naked construction worker pounding a jackhammer at her feet. 
In conversation Ms. Trump is unabashed. If her brash antics prompt people to question her competence, “I’m fine with that,” she said. Paraphrasing one of her father’s favorite maxims, she was quick to add, “It’s the end result that counts.” 
A full wall in her office is papered with magazine covers emblazoned with her image: Southern Seasons, on the occasion of a new Trump project in Atlanta; New York magazine; and Elle Mexico. (“That last allowed us to appeal to a female buyer,” she said.)
Each cover, she said, represents a calculated effort to promote the family name. “What other developer could generate that sort of publicity for free?” 
Although Ms. Trump shares responsibility for the development of several dozen properties with her brothers Donald Jr., 29, and Eric, 23, her recent high visibility has suggested to some that she is her father’s heir apparent. 
But Mr. Trump made it clear that he has no plans to anoint a sole successor. “I have three children who are of age,” he said. “I’d like to see them work together.”
Last summer Ms. Trump was named vice president for acquisitions and development of the Trump Organization; within days she visited Dubai to negotiate a deal for four Trump towers, then flew to Mexico, Panama, Hawaii and finally Chicago, where she was to oversee the construction of a hotel tower. 
Like her father, she is a hectic multitasker. Last fall, she introduced her collection of diamond hoops, rings and lariat necklaces priced from $750 to $350,000 and up, in partnership with Dynamic Diamonds. The jewelry is showcased in the Palm Beach-playful setting of her new boutique on Madison Avenue. She declined to provide figures but maintained that business “has been great.”
“We are making sales every day,” she said. “It’s encouraging.”
She also appears from time to time as a guest on the Fox Business Network “Happy Hour” at 5 p.m. “We get tremendous response whenever she’s on,” said Roger Ailes, the president of Fox News. “For someone so young, she has quite a following.” Mr. Ailes added he would not be surprised to see her one day turn from real estate to news or entertainment. “She’s going to have that opportunity there,” he said.
 Ms. Trump insists that plunging a finger into so many pies will not distract her from her primary calling. “Real estate is my life,” she said. “It is my day job, if you will. But it consumes my nights and weekends, too.” Armed with a BlackBerry and towering heels, her 5-foot-10-inch frame poured into a slender Dolce & Gabbana suit, she is girded for the brazen world that real estate has become.
“Today it is all about branding,” said Donald Capoccia of BFC Partners, a developer of 48 Bond Street, a luxury residence in downtown Manhattan. “It used to be enough to give a new building a name. And real estate was a low-tech bricks and mortar and dirt operation. But this is a view a young person coming into the business right now certainly wouldn’t have.”
For all her youth, Ms. Trump, who graduated summa cum laude from the Wharton School, can talk the talk. She pointed out that 13 hotels are in the pipeline, adding, “People talk credit crunch, but it’s a great testament within the financial community that we’ve secured financing.” Of her father’s new hotel in Waikiki, the Trump International Hotel and Tower, she noted: “We sold the whole building out in five to six hours.” She called it a “gross sellout” of more than $700 million, which has been reported as a real estate record. 
Ms. Trump’s negotiating prowess is tricky to assess, as no reporter has sat at her elbow in a business meeting. But colleagues, who declined to be identified lest they offend her father  even while praising the daughter  said they are impressed by Ms. Trump’s decisiveness. “If people think they can elicit from me whatever terms they want, they are mistaken,” Ms. Trump said.
Ms. Trump was bred by her father and her mother, Ivana, who have since divorced, to show competitive mettle. She recalled racing down a ski slope, at age 8, during a family trip to Aspen, Colo. “At one point I remember thinking it was rather bizarre that I had started moving backwards up the hill,” Ms. Trump said. “It took me not too long to realize that my father had hooked his ski pole around the cuff of my unitard. Clearly he wanted to win.”
On the job, competition with her brothers sometimes “reaches a pitch,” she said, confiding that shortly before joining the company she didn’t sleep very well. “My biggest fear was that I would perform well but that there would be some internal conflict” with her siblings, she said. “There was no way to know how we’d get along.”
Nor whether she would succeed. “In the worst-case scenario, I knew I could be fired,” she said. “But it would not have been for a lack of deal flow. What would be scary for me is to exist at the Trump Organization in a minor capacity. Mediocrity terrifies me.”
Insistent on proving herself, Ms. Trump first took a job outside the Trump Organization. Bruce Ratner, the Brooklyn developer, put her to work with the project management team for Ridge Hill, his shopping center in Yonkers. “She did everything,” Mr. Ratner recalled, “from running the numbers of a deal to negotiating with tenants and coordinating where they would go in the center, to helping lay out the space.” 
 “She was down-to-earth,” he said. “She worked like everybody else. There was no special privilege about her.”
Ms. Trump disdains the attitude of entitlement that plagues some of her peers. She pays the mortgage on her own apartment, a $1.5 million unit at Trump Park Avenue. No Paris Hilton, she has determinedly sidestepped scandal. After some coaxing, she acknowledged dating Mr. Kushner, but declined to discuss their relationship. “Nothing good can come of that,” she said. 
“There are enough stories about my family,” she said. “We have all been in the public eye. And we understand the process.”
 Ms. Trump is still living down an abortive career as a teenage model and widespread current speculation that her face and figure have been surgically enhanced. 
No matter. The Trumps, she implied, are impervious to shame. “I grew up watching my father on ‘Saturday Night Live,’ ” she said. “You may remember, in some of those skits, they had him dressed up like a chicken.” 
NBC’s “Celebrity Apprentice” won Thursday night’s ratings among adults 18 to 49. Nielsen estimated that the premiere of the latest edition of the reality show, with celebrities including the boxer Lennox Lewis, below, had 11 million viewers in the 9 o’clock hour, an improvement of almost 2 million over last season’s debut. NBC tied Fox for No. 1 over all, leading at 8 with “Deal or No Deal” (13.3 million) but trailing at 10 with “ER” (9.6 million). CBS ranked third, despite drawing the largest audience of the night with a repeat of “CSI” at 9 (13.5 million). ABC was a distant fourth.
It is unusual in any sport for a player to win an event three years in a row. To win four consecutive years is almost unknown. But last week Jay Borker of Greenwich, Conn., won the Friday Open Pairs at the District 3 Winter Regional in Rye Brook, N.Y., for the fourth straight year with his fourth partner. This time he played with Doug Doub of West Hartford, Conn. They finished nearly two boards ahead of Arch McKellar of Dobbs Ferry, N.Y., and Warren Rosner of White Plains. Third were Richard Laufer of Hartsdale, N.Y., and Faye Marino of Greenwich.
The diagramed deal featured some interesting bidding.
Borker (North) and Doub were using the weak no-trump, opening one no-trump with 12-14 points. So North had to start with one club. South used an inverted minor-suit raise, promising at least four clubs and game-invitational or stronger values. South knew that if his partner had only three clubs, he would have 15 or more points, and they would presumably reach three no-trump.
Now West entered the auction with a two-diamond overcall, leaving North unsure what to do. He contemplated doubling, but was not certain how it would have been interpreted by his partner. (It ought to be for penalty.) He decided to make a natural rebid with two hearts, but I think a forcing pass would have been better. Then maybe South would have doubled because he had such a flat hand.
Two diamonds doubled can be beaten by three tricks for plus 800 if the defense takes two spades, three hearts, one diamond and two clubs. This requires keeping declarer out of the dummy, so that he cannot play a club toward his king. When West leads the spade king from his hand, trying to generate a dummy entry with the spade jack, North must duck.
After North rebid two hearts, South raised to three hearts to show where his values lay. Also, perhaps four hearts in the 4-3 fit would have been the best contract. North continued with three spades, nervous of bidding three no-trump with only ace-doubleton in diamonds. And South, feeling that he had denied a good diamond holding by not bidding no-trump earlier, converted to three no-trump. Whew!
The 13th NEC Cup Bridge Festival ended in Yokohama, Japan, eight days ago, and the diagramed deal featured probably the best defense during the five days of play. It was Board 13 of the quarterfinals.
 For the fourth time in five years, Israel won the event, its team consisting of Migry Zur Campanile, Michael Barel and Doron and Israel Yadlin, who are brothers.
 East’s double in the diagramed deal was not for penalty; it was takeout of spades, the opener’s suit.
 Campanile, who now lives in Las Vegas, led her club eight. Barel took two tricks in the suit and gave his partner a club ruff. What happened next?
 At every other table where this position was reached, West shifted to a heart, which was not good enough. When East won with his ace and switched to a trump, declarer ran that to dummy; cashed the heart king, pitching a diamond; and led a diamond toward his king. If East took his heart ace and shifted to diamonds, South won with his king and ruffed a diamond on the board. And when East ducked his heart ace, declarer played a low spade to force a dummy entry for a diamond lead toward his king.
 Campanile, realizing that declarer had three diamonds and would be going for a ruff on the board, shifted to a trump. Then Barel did his part by playing his low spade, not the king.
 Now the contract was dead.
 Whatever declarer did, East, when in with the heart ace or diamond ace, would lead back his spade king, killing the diamond ruff and keeping declarer away from the heart king.
IN some segments of the real estate market, much bigger is much better. Just ask Donald J. Trump. 
Last fall, Mr. Trump sold the last three remaining apartments atop his glass-walled Trump World Tower, a k a 845 United Nations Plaza, to Chinh E. Chu, a senior managing director at the Blackstone Group, a private equity firm, for $34.3 million.
 These units provided a combined total of 16,000 square feet of space with 16-foot high ceilings and striking views from the entire 89th floor and part of the 90th floor of the building. (That is 90 stories according to the elevator buttons, and 70 stories according to the Department of Buildings.)
Now Mr. Chu is in contract to buy some additional space for $5 million atop the building, which is on First Avenue near East 48th Street, bringing his total cost to $39.3 million. That would be the seventh highest Manhattan apartment sale, according to city records.
Mr. Trump says he originally built two apartments on each of the 89th and 90th floors at the top the 900-foot-tall building, which opened at the beginning of 2001. But the penthouses languished on the market, until he began marketing them as combined space for superaffluent buyers. 
“When I reconfigured it, it sold right away,” Mr. Trump said. “The bigger the apartment and the higher the price, the easier it is to sell.”
Mr. Trump declined to identify Mr. Chu as the buyer (though property tax notices were sent last month to the Blackstone Group’s New York office) or to describe the new space. But according to several people briefed on the deal, Mr. Chu paid an extra $5 million to buy a 1,200-square-foot outdoor space on a part of the roof above his apartment. 
Mr. Chu’s three apartments have now been stripped down to the studs and wires, as a huge renovation is under way. According to a company biography, Mr. Chu led Blackstone’s investments in and acquisitions of a series of companies. He was said to be out of town and unavailable for comment last week.
Mr. Chu is less well-known and less flamboyant that the founding partners of Blackstone, though perhaps no less ambitious in the Manhattan real estate market. Stephen A. Schwarzman, one founding partner, who celebrated his 60th birthday last year with hundreds of friends at the Seventh Regiment Armory on Park Avenue, owns a duplex at 740 Park Avenue that he bought from the financier Saul Steinberg. The price has been variously reported as just under $30 million and as much as $37 million.
Last year, the other co-founder of Blackstone, Peter G. Peterson, a former United States secretary of commerce, paid $37.5 million for a duplex at 810 Fifth Avenue, which he bought from David Geffen, the record and film producer. 
Property records filed last week show that Mr. Peterson’s wife, Joan Ganz Cooney, a founder of the Children’s Television Workshop, which created “Sesame Street,” sold their previous apartment at River House at 435 East 52nd Street near First Avenue for $10 million on Valentine’s Day. The buyer was Jeffrey T. Leeds, the president and co-founder of Leeds Equity Partners, another private equity firm.
The sale to Mr. Chu was actually the second time that Mr. Trump thought he had sold the spaces. In the late 1990s, two Turkish brothers with telecommunications interests agreed to pay $32 million for the two top floors of the building. But they faced investigations and legal challenges involving their business activities and never closed. 
Mr. Trump said he won a lawsuit to keep their $8 million deposit.
No one can ever accuse Gucci of doing things halfheartedly. For the opening of its largest boutique in the world  a 46,000-square-foot gold-and-glass extravaganza in Manhattan’s Trump Tower  Madonna and the Gucci creative director, Frida Giannini, held a star-studded fund-raiser on the north lawn of the United Nations to benefit Unicef and Raising Malawi. But those looking to combine their altruism with a little swag need not have worried  Giannini also designed two bag collections for the occasion: “Heritage” (left) plays up Gucci’s history with a rendition of a print from the 1950s, while “New York Exclusive” pays tribute to the Big Apple, with all proceeds benefiting the Central Park playgrounds. [?][?][?]LEE CARTER 
GARDEN CITY, N.Y.  Donald Trump’s plan to build a catering hall at Jones Beach suffered a setback on Tuesday at the end of a prolonged hearing into the technical barriers in building a basement on the edge of the Atlantic Ocean. But technical issues were not what drew most of the 200 people who attended, or what kept many of them waiting five hours for a chance to speak. 
It was more the karma question.
Should the guy with the red-faced-hyper-salesman-ringmaster style  the man whose very name evokes in the mind of the average person the words “You’re Fired!”  be invited by the state to open a restaurant in the sanctuary for barefoot humans that is Jones Beach State Park?
“It’s not the idea of a restaurant that bothers me,” Dennis Owens, a retired building contractor from Massapequa, a Long Island town adjacent to the beach, said at the hearing. “It’s the way he wants to do it. Big and fancy. The $500-a-plate clientele. His name in giant letters. If he could just tone it down a little bit, it wouldn’t be such an affront.”
In a 4-to-1 decision, a state code enforcement board of review said Mr. Trump and his partners would have to scale down their plans for building kitchen facilities in the basement. Steven M. Carl, a Long Island businessman who is Mr. Trump’s partner in the project, said the decision would be contested.
"It’s a shame to be treated like this. Two guys trying to do the right thing for Long Island, and all we get is a bunch of people who don’t appreciate it,” Mr. Carl said. "But we’re going to do everything in our power to preserve our right to build this thing.”
Mr. Trump, who did not attend the hearing, struck a deal with the state in the final days of the Pataki administration to build a 46,000-square-foot catering hall on the boardwalk and operate it for 40 years. In exchange, he would pay the state $200,000 a year plus a percentage of sales revenues that begins at zero and increases to a maximum of 5 percent during the life of the lease. Bernadette Castro, the state parks commissioner who signed off on the deal in 2006, saying it would bring economic vitality to a park property that was not supporting itself, called Mr. Trump’s plan “like a gift from God.” 
Since the original deal, however, Mr. Trump and Mr. Carl have expanded the plans to accommodate 76,000 square feet of space, with a newly excavated 27,000-square-foot basement kitchen area. The basement expansion was the subject of Tuesday’s hearing.
Under state environmental laws, basements built in flood or tidal zones cannot be used for anything but storage. Mr. Trump’s plan would have more than 100 people working in the basement kitchen seven days a week.
During a packed hearing of a state code enforcement board of review, held in an exhibition hall of the Cradle of Aviation Museum at Mitchel Field here, Marco Gennarelli, the board chairman, said the basement would be the only issue under review. 
Aesthetics, expansions, the terms of the lease, and whether the deal kept with the values in which Jones Beach State Park was conceived would not be discussed, he said. 
Thomas J. Garry, a lawyer representing the project, said the basement would essentially be a “waterproof concrete box” that would ensure the safety of people working in it and protect the restaurant against any kind of storm surge, including hurricanes.
There were opponents who disputed the idea of an inviolable concrete box as “Titanic-think,” and opponents who argued that environmental laws should be obeyed by everyone, including famous developers. In rejecting the basement expansion, the review board sited potential fire hazards faced by the people who would have to work there.
But when Bill McNulty of Setauket got a chance to speak (No. 35 on a list of more than 50 people who signed up to address the board), he said the basement was not the point.
“This is a people’s beach,” he said. “It was conceived in the 1930s by Robert Moses as a place for working people. Adding a catering facility for people willing to pay $500 a plate for their dinner is the furthest thing from what Jones Beach was meant to be.” (The beach actually opened in the summer of 1929.)
In advertising brochures, Mr. Trump and Mr. Carl portray their dining hall as “the perfect place to celebrate life’s significant moments in style,” a style they price at rates of $300 to $500 per person.
However, as questions about the scope of the project have been raised, plans to begin accepting reservations for the spring of 2009 were recently put off.
Harvey B. Levinson, chairman of the Nassau County Board of Assessors, has suggested that the project contribute some money to the local school district in lieu of taxes  a suggestion that prompted Mr. Trump to characterize Mr. Levinson as “a loser.”
And while the presiding officer of the County Legislature has endorsed the project, saying it would bring 500 jobs, other legislators, including David Denenberg, whose district includes parts of Bellmore, Merrick, Freeport and Wantagh, the towns nearest the beach, have raised questions about what they call the lack of transparency in which the original deal was struck.
“This whole thing was rammed through in a way that is not consistent with the democratic process,” he said on Tuesday. 
Mr. Carl, speaking to reporters at the hearing, said the deal was made “in keeping with all laws and regulations of the state.”
Louis Albertini, 82, and his wife, Rose, 77, did not rise to speak on the plan, but sat in the back of the room throughout the hearing. They walk for exercise on the boardwalk at Jones Beach several times a week.
“Now he wants to expand this, now he wants to add more tables, now he’s going to need more parking space,” Mr. Albertini, a retired New York City worker, said. “What I want to know is, where are people like me and my wife going to go to get a cup of coffee?”
Trump Entertainment Resorts, the casino company founded by Donald J. Trump, posted on Wednesday its biggest loss since emerging from bankruptcy in 2005.
The fourth-quarter loss swelled to $183.2 million, or $5.89 a share, from $9.68 million, or 31 cents, a year earlier, the company said. Revenue fell 6.4 percent, to $228.6 million.
A fourth consecutive quarter of revenue declines led the company to declare that its three Atlantic City properties were worth $238.7 million less than it said they were last year.
Trump Entertainment has been battered by a slowing economy and competition, both from slots-only casinos that opened in Pennsylvania after November 2006 and other Atlantic City properties that can spend more on marketing. The company’s stock has plummeted since efforts to sell one of its casinos stalled in June. Analysts say a sale is necessary to pay off debt and diversify into other markets.
Trump Entertainment declined 26 cents, or 7 percent, to close at $3.44 on Nasdaq. The shares have dropped 20 percent this year and 75 percent since the company emerged from bankruptcy in May 2005.
GARDEN CITY, N.Y.  Donald Trump said on Wednesday that he would go to court for the right to expand a planned catering hall at Jones Beach to include a 26,000-square-foot basement to accommodate its kitchens, a proposal that was rejected the night before by a state code enforcement review board.
After a public hearing filled with complaints about Mr. Trump’s project, the board voted 4-to-1 Tuesday against granting a variance of state building codes that would let the basement work proceed.
Mr. Trump conceived the expanded basement after signing a 40-year lease in 2006 to build and operate a 46,000-square-foot catering hall anchored by a smaller basement with no kitchen. Mr. Trump said the board ruling would indefinitely delay the opening of the catering hall, planned for 2009.
 “We have a binding long-term contract with the state that was negotiated over a three-year period and which they have now, foolishly, broken,” he said in a written statement on Wednesday. “We must now cancel many weddings, bar mitzvahs, birthdays and business meetings. All this because the state does not want us to build a basement which had already existed for 30 years in the previous building.”
The basement Mr. Trump referred to was a storage basement in the much smaller restaurant that his project, Trump on the Ocean, would replace. The basement in the original structure, since demolished, was used only for storage. The basement proposed by Mr. Trump, on a site just north of the old restaurant, would house kitchen facilities employing more than 100 workers. 
State building codes permit basements to be built in flood and tidal plains, but only for storage, not for human occupancy.
Some political leaders on Long Island have endorsed the expanded project, in which Mr. Trump is partnered with Steven M. Carl, a Long Island businessman, as an economic boon in construction and restaurant jobs. Others have criticized it as too big and showy for the Jones Beach setting. More than 200 people attended the review board hearing on Tuesday, all but a few to argue that Mr. Trump’s vision was out of sync with the low-key charm of Jones Beach.
In his statement, Mr. Trump said, “Unfortunately, instead of investing my money on contractors and brick and mortar, I must sadly be investing the money on legal fees and lawyers. The state is liable for hundreds of millions of dollars in damages over what would have been a great asset.”
Eamon Moynihan, a spokesman for the office of the secretary of state, which administers the review process for buildings on state land, said he would not comment on Mr. Trump’s plans to challenge the Tuesday ruling.
Tokyo
“Welcome to Honda! Please follow me,” Asimo, my guide, implored in a chirpy voice. 
As I walked with Asimo, a humanoid robot developed by the Honda Motor Company, to a table in the reception area of the company’s headquarters here, I thought how similar my guide seemed to a child in a spaceman costume. It was more than the gleaming outfit or the helmeted head with a dark visor covering the face  Asimo even had the deliberate walk of a child burdened by a bulky outfit and unsure of his surroundings. 
The feeling that there was something alive under all that hardware was still harder to shake once Asimo had delivered tea, bowed and headed off to greet another visitor. 
Developing a robot to greet corporate visitors may seem a frivolous use of Honda’s busy research teams, but Asimo is actually part of a larger program the company has started to build practical robots as programmable assistants. Honda, like other automakers, has plenty of experience in the field: the industry is one of the world’s biggest users of robots. Automotive News, a trade publication, recently reported that North American carmakers and suppliers bought more than 10,000 robots, worth an estimated $753 million, in 2007. 
Asimo has earned Honda more than heaps of free publicity  it also drew the envy of a chief competitor. In 2000, when the first Asimo appeared, Toyota started its own humanoid robot program. Last December, Toyota upped the ante when its president, Katsuaki Watanabe, announced that the company would start selling what it calls a partner robot  one that could perform useful services for people  after 2010. 

Honda, refusing to be one-upped, announced it, too, would have a robot ready for the market around the same time. Both companies offered vague commitments about robots doing household chores and assisting the elderly, but their engineers admitted that the robots faced challenges in moving from the garage to the living room. 
Among automakers, Honda and Toyota have been the most ambitious in making a business of building humanoid helpers. The companies said that developing humanoid robots required advances in mechanics, sensors, computer chips and artificial intelligence, all of which will advance automotive technology as well. But their different corporate cultures have led to differing approaches to humanoids. Pragmatic Toyota envisions humanoid robots at work in hospitals and aiding the elderly.
“It is in line with our corporate philosophy of contributing to society through manufacturing things,” said Masashi Yamashita, general manager of Toyota’s Partner Robot Division.
 Honda, which has a reputation as an engineering-driven company where technological innovations are sometimes pursued for their own sake, decided to work on humanoids “because we thought it would be fun,” said Masato Hirose, who has directed the effort for 21 years.
Honda started by tackling one of the biggest robotics challenges: getting a two-legged robot to walk like a human. (Asimo is an acronym for Advanced Step in Innovative Mobility, but in Japanese it could also mean “legs, too.”)
Honda’s first bipedal robot, unveiled in 1986, was just a pair of legs. By 1993 it added a torso and arms, but it was a Frankensteinian 6-foot-3 and 388 pounds. To make it less threatening, Honda shrank the gears and actuators to the size of an adolescent, 4-feet-3-inches tall and 119 pounds, while progressing from walking to running to climbing stairs. The first Asimo was remotely controlled; now it is increasingly autonomous and being given such capabilities as face and voice recognition. 
Rather than concentrate on a single robot, Toyota has produced a range of models, including some with impressive musical skills. It has robots on legs and on wheels that play the trumpet, tuba, drums and violin, though they can’t switch from one instrument to another. 
Robina, a humanoid on wheels, guides visitors through an exhibition hall on the corporate campus in Toyota City that features Toyota technologies. Mr. Yamashita said the company focused on musical robots for their entertainment value. Engineers also studied how humans accomplish certain specific activities by working with professional musicians. 
Mr. Yamashita said techniques they were working on to aid the elderly had been put to use in Toyota factories in devices that, for example, supply the muscle to lift a windshield while human workers guide it into position. 
A few humanoid technologies are creeping into cars and manufacturing. Honda’s automotive engineers borrowed visualization technology from the humanoid program for the company’s Lane Keeping Assist System, a safety system in which a camera monitors lane lines, allowing steering assistance to keep the car centered. The system was recently introduced for Accord models sold in Europe. 
Mr. Hirose of Honda said more technology was flowing the other way. One of Toyota’s robots maintains its balance on two wheels partly because of gyroscopic sensors adapted from the company’s vehicle stability control system. Honda’s team borrowed from work by automotive researchers into collision avoidance systems to enable two Asimos to walk around the same room without bumping into each other or people. When an Asimo found me in the way, it stopped. I could almost hear the wheels turning its head as it appraised the situation for several seconds and finally chose an alternate route. 

These technologies will need to be much more sophisticated before humanoids can operate on their own outside a controlled environment, or even within a controlled environment. The carpet in Honda’s reception area was studded with tiny reflectors for Asimo’s laser and infrared sensors, which it uses in addition to cameras to navigate. Even so, three technicians watched Asimo serve tea, ready to throw a kill switch if anything went awry. 
Mr. Yamashita of Toyota said another big hurdle was the human interface. Robina can respond to a few spoken commands, but it mostly follows programmed orders. 
Despite the hurdles, by the end of this year Toyota hoped to have a robot assisting nurses at Toyota Memorial Hospital. Mr. Yamashita said the company was discussing with the hospital staff just what a robot might do for them. Honda, while offering no specific plans for what a practical robot might do, did make clear it had a business goal: Mr. Hirose said they were intent on beating Toyota to market. 
It could be that just building humanoid robots is accomplishment enough. James Morris, a computer scientist at the Mountain View, Calif., campus of Carnegie Mellon University, said that Asimo and the Toyota robots were inspiring demonstrations. “Like going to the moon, it’s science as performance art,” he said. 
The Jacoby Open Swiss Teams occupied the final weekend of the Spring North American Championships in Detroit. Ending last Sunday, the event was won by Chris Compton of Dallas; Perry Johnson of Bloomfield Hills, Mich.; Jeff Meckstroth of Tampa, Fla.; and Eric Rodwell of Clearwater Beach, Fla. 
Second were Dennis and Jerry Clerkin of Bloomington, Ind.; Bruce Ferguson of Boise, Idaho; Robert Hollman of Santa Barbara, Calif.; and Krzysztof Buras and Grzegorz Narkiewicz from Poland. In third were Michael Becker, David Berkowitz and Larry Cohen of Boca Raton, Fla.; Chip Martel of Davis, Calif.; Lew Stansby of Castro Valley, Calif.; and Aubrey Strul of Delray Beach, Fla.
 In the next-to-last round, the teams that finished first and third played against each other. The diagramed deal is from that match.
 At the other table, Berkowitz (South) opened one spade in the third position, Rodwell (West) passed, Cohen (North) raised to two spades, Compton (East) made a takeout double, South bid four spades, and everyone passed.
 West led the club king. With one club and one heart to lose, declarer had to guess the trump suit. Deciding that East would not have made his takeout double with the doubleton queen-four of spades, Berkowitz played a spade to his king and made the contract.
 In the given auction, Johnson (South) opened one spade, Martel (West) overcalled two clubs, Meckstroth (North) raised to two spades, and Stansby (East) made a responsive double. When South’s jump to four spades came back to East, he doubled for penalties.
 West led the club king, which declarer ducked. After a lot of thought, West shifted to a low diamond, declarer trying dummy’s king, then ruffing East’s ace.
 South now played a heart to dummy’s ace, when maybe leading the queen to locate the king would have been better. Then South called for a spade, East playing low smoothly.
 Deciding that if East had had all three missing spades he might have tried to reach three no-trump, and judging that East was unlikely to have doubled twice with queen-doubleton, Johnson also put up his spade king to make his contract.
 Minus 420 and plus 590 gave the winners 5 international match points on the board and a victory in the match.
 If Johnson had gone down in four spades doubled, the match result would have been reversed, and who knows what would have happened in the last round?
MADISON AVENUE has always been a place for sun worshipers, whether it was naming brands like Sun, Sunlight, Sunbird, Sunbeam and Sol; coining slogans like “A day with orange juice is like a day without sunshine”; or sending the Coppertone girl and her dog out on the beach to urge, “Don’t be a paleface.”
The newest demonstration of solar power (figuratively) is coming from the Frito-Lay division of PepsiCo, which is using the sun to help transform its SunChips line of multigrain snack chips into a “green” brand. The initiative is centered on the addition of solar power (literally) to the Frito-Lay plant in Modesto, Calif., that makes SunChips. A 10-acre “farm” of solar collectors is being added, to provide up to 75 percent of the energy needed to produce the product.
The plant, one of seven in the United States that make SunChips, is scheduled to start using solar power on Earth Day, April 22, as part of ambitious efforts by Frito-Lay and PepsiCo to convince consumers that the companies care about the environment.
Those measures include buying renewable energy credits, a move that is being promoted on packages of SunChips. The company is also rethinking manufacturing processes to use less water and power and is installing fuel-efficient ovens.
Frito-Lay does not intend to hide its light under a bushel. A campaign to inform shoppers about the ecologically friendly changes is getting under way, composed of television commercials, print advertisements, billboards, information on the SunChips Web site (sunchips.com) and a presence on Facebook, the social-networking Web site.
 Environmental themes are enjoying a boom and are changing how marketers and agencies talk to consumers. Companies like Coca-Cola, General Electric, General Motors, Macy’s, E. W. Scripps, Toyota and Wal-Mart are clambering aboard a bandwagon painted green, festooned with flowers and powered by an engine that runs on biodiesel fuel.
A dozen news releases so far this week have featured ecological themes, like Macy’s teaming up with the National Parks Foundation for a fund-raiser called Turn Over a New Leaf and the opening by Union, an ad agency in New York, of a shop named Union Green that will specialize in work for “eco-conscious clients.”
 A skeptic could have fun with the earnest tone and greener-than-thou attitude that infuse many of the initiatives in this realm. So many marketers have been putting environmental claims in their ads that the trade publication Brandweek recently observed in a headline that “a green backlash gains momentum.”
There is even a term, greenwashing, coined to describe the perceptions of consumers that a marketer is inappropriately adopting a green persona.

“This is a space that, frankly, everybody is trying to learn about, and we’re in that boat as well,” said Gannon Jones, vice president for marketing at Frito-Lay in Plano, Tex. He is overseeing the creation of the SunChips campaign by Juniper Park, an agency in Toronto affiliated with the BBDO Worldwide unit of the Omnicom Group.
As consumers express concerns for the planet, Mr. Jones said, “companies are scrambling to find out as much as they can and respond appropriately.”
“The companies and brands that are successful don’t treat green as a promotional strategy,” he added. “They embrace it throughout their business strategy.”
Mr. Jones, as may be expected, places Frito-Lay among the marketers that have deeds behind their green words. Although he declined to offer details, he described the installation of the solar panels at the Modesto plant as a multimillion-dollar investment that exceeded the budget for the SunChips campaign.
That is significant because there are numerous examples of advertisers that spent more on campaigns to tell the public about noble activities, like bringing out green products or making charitable donations, than was spent on the activities themselves.
“What we’re talking about is what we’re doing or what we’ve done,” Mr. Jones said of the campaign. “We’re not making claims we can’t back up because the wild claims have the potential to be harmful to the green movement over the long haul.”
The commercials in the campaign, which are to start appearing on April 4, feature girls and women frolicking in the sun as an announcer invites viewers to “imagine capturing the sun’s power and making chips with it.” The spots end with the words “SunChips, now made with solar energy,” and the brand’s theme, “Live brightly.”
One way green campaigns seek to avoid seeming too morally pure is to take a humorous tongue-in-cheek tack, and elements of the SunChips campaign follow that approach.
For example, the billboards are to be built so that the letters spelling out the brand name are attached above the signs upside down and backward. When the sun comes out, the name will appear, cast in shadow across the top of the signs. 
And advertisements scheduled to run in newspapers are being billed as “solar-powered.” The jest involves Frito-Lay’s buying both sides of a page in each newspaper and printing the type backward on the back side of the page. The front side will carry this note: “Take this page and hold it up to the sun.” When the readers do so, the type will be visible through the page.
“People think they have to make massive changes to affect anything,” said Barry Quinn, creative director at Juniper Park. “We’re giving them the opportunity to make small steps.”
“A tiny little step may lead to more small steps,” he added, “and more small steps may lead to something.”
The SunChips Web site and the product packages also discuss what are called small steps being taken by Frito-Lay to address environmental and diet issues.
“It’s not like I’m eating an apple,” Mr. Quinn said of snacking on SunChips. “We’re not pretending to be a bowl of oatmeal.”
But when consumers choose to snack, SunChips offer “something better” than other options, he added, based on the 18 grams of whole grains  and zero grams of trans fat  in each 1-ounce serving.

As for the environmental aspects of the campaign, “we’re not claiming to be eco-warriors,” Mr. Quinn said, but “it’s not like greenwashing” because the Frito-Lay plant is “really using solar power to make the chips.”
Mr. Jones said that Frito-Lay intended to add solar power to as many of the SunChips plants as it could. But clearly, the Modesto plant in sunny California lends itself to solar power more than, say, the plant in Aberdeen, Md.
A Frito-Lay plant in Casa Grande, Ariz., is getting at least 50 acres of solar collectors to make snacks using solar power, but production of SunChips at that site has not started yet.
Frito-Lay has considerably increased its spending on ads for SunChips in major media, according to TNS Media Intelligence, a research service owned by Taylor Nelson Sofres. Spending last year totaled almost $10.8 million, according to TNS data, compared with $18,000 in 2006.

A humorous campaign for Rolling Rock beer by Goodby, Silverstein & Partners in San Francisco, also part of Omnicom, is all about “moonvertising”  imaginary attempts by Rolling Rock, owned by Anheuser-Busch, to beam its logo onto the moon’s surface when the moon is full each month.
THAT history has not been just a string of kindnesses and gifts of beauty for the ancient, golden city of Prague is far from apparent at first glance. 
The blows of World War II and the heavy hand of Communist construction — so apparent in neighboring capitals — are barely discernable there. It is nothing like the wholesale reinvention of Bucharest, the scars of Warsaw or the division of Berlin.
“The people of Prague had an inferiority complex with respect to those other cities,” Milan Kundera wrote in his now-classic novel “The Unbearable Lightness of Being.” “Old Town Hall was the only monument of note destroyed in the war, and they decided to leave it in ruins so that no Pole or German could accuse them of having suffered less than their share.”
The hall is in ruins no longer, and the city’s Old Town begs a postcard from almost every angle. On a crisp fall day, the flagrant yellows and reds of the autumn trees on the lesser bank of the Vltava gild the city’s already rich skyline. The Charles Bridge remains in a permanent tourist traffic jam long past the summer high season.
The streams of visitors are not disappointed by the Gothic Tyn Church or the Art Nouveau Municipal House. But the result of so much beauty is a visual amnesia that lulls even the historically versed visitor into a kind of forgetting, encouraging a Disney castle version of the city and rendering Prague’s recent wounds almost invisible.
As Tereza, a principal character in the novel, climbs the grassy Petrin Hill, Mr. Kundera wrote, “On her way up, she paused several times to look back: below her she saw the towers and bridges, the saints were shaking their fists and lifting their stone eyes to the clouds. It was the most beautiful city in the world.”
But “The Unbearable Lightness of Being,” first published in a French translation from Czech in 1984, is no love letter to the city; it is a message from a time of oppression, and one worth carrying for perspective on a trip through Prague. Mr. Kundera submerges the reader in the undercurrents of political life, the rough passages of far-too-recent vintage and the personal repercussions of an invasive, claustrophobic time. 
Tereza is climbing Petrin in a dream — a dream in which she will be executed, but only if she convinces the executioners that she seeks death of her own free will. The novel returns again and again to Tereza’s harrowing dreams, simultaneously erotic and morbid.
She and her husband, Tomas, are living through a most tumultuous period for what was then Czechoslovakia: the crackdown by the Soviet Union after Czechoslovakia’s attempt at liberalizing reform. The Prague Spring of 1968 was a brief flowering of openness behind the Iron Curtain; what followed was a trauma hidden inside the city. The novel provides a key to remembering.
Mr. Kundera writes of a time when a former ambassador could be consigned to the reception desk at a hotel, when private conversations were not only recorded by the police but broadcast on state radio and when the cinematographers of authority would set up bright lights and film cameras at a funeral to record the mourners’ faces for study. In the novel, Tomas, a superior surgeon, is consigned by the authorities to wash windows because of a politically provocative essay he once wrote about Oedipus and the guilt of unknowing crimes.
Today, scenes of surveillance and harassment play on a permanent loop in the small video room at the Museum of Communism. The visitor is also confronted by unforgettable images of tanks on the streets outside, armed forces in Wenceslas Square and protesters’ being sprayed by hoses and beaten with clubs.
Much is held at the arm’s-length distance of black and white. But the scene shifts to the demonstrations in 1989 that led to the collapse of the Soviet-backed regime. Suddenly the faded jeans and bad haircuts are distinctly recognizable as — for all but the youngest of us — coming from our own time. The blows of the clubs seem to land that much harder with the realization that it could be you.
Though moving and informative, the Museum of Communism has a strangely amateur feel. Busts of party heroes are collected in one corner haphazardly and without explanation, like knick-knacks in a grandmother’s attic. The texts on the walls are at times quaint, like the one that declares: “From the very beginning, Lenin pushed forward the tactics of extreme perfidiousness and ruthlessness,” which earns a laugh but also cuts through the typical staleness of academic understatement.
But perhaps most surprising is that the museum itself is hidden on a commercial strip of Na Prikope, tucked, as the museum’s own literature puts it, “above McDonald’s, next to Casino.” Decades of a dictatorship for an entire country, a dictatorship within the lifetime of most Czech people, is squeezed into a space smaller than another pleasant enough museum devoted to the Slavic Art Nouveau pioneer Alphonse Mucha.
There is no question that Prague has chosen — at least for its public face — not to dwell on the Communist era. In the Kundera novel, Sabina, Tomas’s lover and an artist, detests when she or her work are revered or adored for her country’s trauma: “The trouble was that Sabina had no love for that drama. The words ‘prison,’ ‘persecution,’ ‘banned books,’ ‘occupation,’ ‘tanks,’ were ugly, without the slightest trace of romance.”
It is easy to understand why residents would just as soon forget the entire episode. And tourists can be forgiven for concentrating on the city’s grandeur rather than hunting for odd remnants of Communism. 
As much as it cherishes the decorative finery of Mr. Mucha, the city unabashedly embraces Franz Kafka as its literary laureate, with Kafka tours, Kafka cafes, Kafka restaurants and Kafka hotels. But it is a branded Kafka commodity, stripped of the dread of “The Trial,” a quaint Kafka tailored to match the charms of old Bohemian beer halls and castle views.
The alleyways and courtyards of the city still embody the disorienting quality of Kafka’s work. As cold night descends, the twisting little lanes seem to mock the city plan clutched in a traveler’s numbing fingers. Prague defies maps. Prague is a place to get lost.
Mr. Kundera recounts how ordinary people across Czechoslovakia tried to foil their invaders not with cannons but by tearing down the street signs to slow and confuse their oppressors. The act feels distinctly Czech in its mixture of defiance, creativity, pacifism and even the hint of oddness.
With Mr. Kundera’s work as a point of reference, the city takes on a different aspect. It is as if Tomas, reduced to window washer by the regime, were wielding the squeegee on the plate glass fronts of the luxury boutiques off the Old Town Square and winking at the shoppers inside.
Though Wenceslas Square is topped by the equestrian rectitude of its patron saint, it is anything but upstanding. Preservationists would no doubt love to wipe away Casino Happy Day’s light-studded facade, its neon palm tree and incongruously colored dollar signs flashing red and yellow. The square is home to drug pushers and strip-club panderers, solicitous to members of the roving packs of stag party celebrants who descend upon the city each weekend.
The novel — and the movie made after it — is best known for the erotic contradiction of Sabina, stripped down to her underwear and wearing an old-fashioned bowler hat. This single object is slowly weighted down with a series of meanings, from the functional article it was for Sabina’s grandfather, a 19th-century mayor; to the sexually charged plaything it became to the lovers; and eventually as a monument to their affair after it had ended. 
“Each time the same object would give rise to a new meaning, though all former meanings would resonate (like an echo, like a parade of echoes),” Mr. Kundera writes, “enriching the harmony.”
The same could be said for the city. The monumental misfit of the former Federal Assembly building, where the Slovak and Czech delegates once met, squats near Wenceslas Square, one of the lonely examples of Communist-era architecture downtown. Its colossal overhang seems to me like a giant chin stuck out for an uppercut from architecture critics.
It was built on top of the old Prague stock exchange without destroying the original building, a project heavy with symbolism. In another layer of historical irony the building became home after the Velvet Revolution to Radio Free Europe, the United States-financed service.
The city is ripe with such turnabouts. The national martyr Jan Palach died after setting himself on fire in 1969 to protest the Soviet occupation. Now, the one-time Square of the Red Army Soldiers bears his name. 
“The history of the Czechs and of Europe is a pair of sketches from the pen of mankind’s fateful inexperience,” Mr. Kundera wrote. “History is as light as individual human life, unbearably light, light as a feather, as dust swirling into the air, as whatever will no longer exist tomorrow.”
From his exile in Paris, Mr. Kundera was less prescient about the imminent collapse of communism, writing of “the forfeit of their nation’s freedom for many decades or even centuries.” The Communist era may have begun to seem like one of those passing sketches in the flipbook of history, but four decades after World War II the Iron Curtain seemed of unshakable permanence. 
That is a memory worth holding onto, one that gives depth to, rather than contradicting, the city’s beauty, as a place that survived its trial and came out, if not unscathed, strong and fair.
IF YOU GO
GETTING THERE 
Czech Airlines flies direct from Kennedy Airport in New York to Prague, starting at around $800 round trip for travel in April. (Under an agreement, Delta can also sell tickets for the Czech Airlines flights.)
WHERE TO GO
The Museum of Communism, with displays on schooling, industry and sports of the era as well as a model interrogation room, is at Na Prikope 10 (420-224-212-966). For a slightly more aesthetic experience, visit the Mucha Museum (Panska 7; 420-224-216-415; www.mucha.cz), devoted to the Art Nouveau artist Alphonse Mucha. To pick up a copy of “Unbearable Lightness” or any of Milan Kundera’s works in English, stop by the Globe Bookstore (Pstrossova 6; 420-224-934-203).
WHERE TO STAY
 The Four Seasons Hotel Prague (Veleslavinova 2a/1098; 420-221-427-000) is a landmark of luxury by the banks of the Vltava River, with rooms starting at 370 euros, or $592 at $1.60 to the euro (hotel rates in Prague are commonly posted in euros). For a boutique hotel with a more modern touch try the Hotel Josef (Rybna 20; 420-221-700-111), a sleek, centrally located, minimalist building designed by the Czech-born architect Eva Jiricna, who herself lived in exile after the Soviet crackdown in 1968. Doubles start at 149 euros a night.
WHERE TO EAT
 Also steps from the Vltava River, V Zatisi (Liliova 1; 420-222-221-155) mixes international cuisine with local specialties to delicious effect, with a playful, artistic décor that includes an entire wall made from yellowing stacks of books, the blank edges of the pages facing outward rather than the spines. Try the duckling and herb dumplings for 495 koruna, or about $30 at 16.25 koruna to the dollar. For a traditional Prague pub, grab a beer and a sausage at the famous U Zlateho Tygra (Husova 17; 420-222-221-111).
The movie “21” held the winning hand against the vintage-football comedy “Leatherheads” in the struggle for weekend supremacy at the box office. “21,” the card-counting blackjack tale distributed by Columbia Pictures and starring Jim Sturgess, right, hung onto the No. 1 ranking by grossing an estimated $15.1 million in its second week in release, according to the tracking company Media by Numbers. “Leatherheads” (Universal), directed by and starring George Clooney, pulled in $13.4 million in its debut, finishing just ahead of the $13.3 million for another newcomer, the comedy-adventure “Nim’s Island” (Fox), starring Abigail Breslin, Jodie Foster and Gerard Butler. Fourth place went to “Dr. Seuss’ Horton Hears a Who” (Fox) with $9.1 million, elevating its four-week total to $131 million. Finishing at No. 5 was the horror film “The Ruins” (Paramount), with $7.8 million on its opening weekend.
To counter opponents’ accusations that he lacks experience in foreign policy, Senator Barack Obama of Illinois often cites his ties to relatives in poor villages in Kenya and the years he spent growing up in Indonesia. Now he has added a new personal detail to that résumé: a trip to Pakistan while a college student. 
 Mr. Obama, the front-runner in the race for the Democratic presidential nomination, made the disclosure Sunday night while speaking to supporters at a fund-raiser in San Francisco. His remarks, in which he poked fun at the utility of traditional foreign policy qualifications like government officials traveling abroad on fact-finding missions, were recorded and were quickly placed on the Web.
 With the war in Iraq and Islamic terrorism among the top issues in the campaign, all three of the presidential contenders have sought to emphasize the value of their very different foreign policy credentials. Senator John McCain, the presumptive Republican nominee, has often pointed to his military and combat experience, while Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton has emphasized her involvement in international and national security issues as both first lady and a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee. 
 But Mr. Obama has argued that his rivals’ longer official record is no substitute for his real-life grass-roots experience. “Foreign policy is the area where I am probably most confident that I know more and understand the world better than Senator Clinton and Senator McCain,” he said in his remarks in San Francisco.
 “Experience in Washington is not knowledge of the world,” he continued, provoking laughter among those present. “This I know. When Senator Clinton brags, ‘I’ve met leaders from 80 countries,’ I know what those trips are like. I’ve been on them. You go from the airport to the embassy. There’s a group of children who do a native dance. You meet with the C.I.A. station chief and the embassy and they give you a briefing. You go take a tour of plant that” with “the assistance of Usaid has started something. And then, you go.” 
 During the speech, Mr. Obama also spoke about having traveled to Pakistan in the early 1980s. Because of that trip, which he did not mention in either of his autobiographical books, “I knew what Sunni and Shia was before I joined the Senate Foreign Relations Committee,” he said.
 Over all, Mr. Obama’s remarks seemed directed primarily at his Democratic rival, Mrs. Clinton. But some of his digs, including the one about distinguishing Shias from Sunnis, also apply to Mr. McCain, whose campaign offered a sharp, mocking response to Mr. Obama’s claim to expertise.
 “When John McCain travels on official business, he meets with presidents, prime ministers, foreign and defense ministers, members of parliament, human rights leaders, N.G.O.’s, business leaders and journalists so that he acquires a full understanding of the country he visits and the issues at stake in our relations,” said Mark Salter, a senior adviser to Mr. McCain. “Oh, and as Senator Obama may know, he has actually spent some time living abroad as well.” 
 Even more than a gap on specific policies, Mr. Obama and Mr. McCain’s respective positions represent a fundamental philosophical difference. Mr. Obama’s advisers argue that “there are multiple aspects to experience, each of which can be relevant.” Mr. Obama’s experience “provides a different kind of insight” than the traditional résumé, said Susan E. Rice, a former assistant secretary of state for African affairs and a National Security Council official who is one of Mr. Obama’s foreign policy advisers.
 “At a time when our foreign policy and national security have so obviously suffered from a simplistic, black-and-white interpretation,” Ms. Rice added, having “an American president who spent part of his formative years and young adulthood living in a poor country under a dictatorship brings an understanding of the complexity of things that others may not have. I’m not saying that official travels and Congressional delegations are without value, but there are limits to what you can glean from that.” 
 Mr. Obama’s advisers acknowledge that there are gaps in his experience  he has never traveled to Latin America, for instance  but they maintain that the sound judgment they say he has demonstrated on foreign policy issues, like Iraq and Pakistan, where he wants the United States to distance itself from Gen. Pervez Musharraf, more than compensates for any such shortcomings.
 According to his campaign staff, Mr. Obama visited Pakistan in 1981, on the way back from Indonesia, where his mother and half-sister, Maya Soetoro-Ng, were living. He spent “about three weeks” there, Mr. Obama’s press secretary, Bill Burton, said, staying in Karachi with the family of a college friend, Mohammed Hasan Chandoo, but also traveling to Hyderabad, in India.
 Mr. Obama appears not to have previously cited his travel in Pakistan in speeches during the campaign. In “Dreams from My Father,” he talks of having a Pakistani roommate when he moved to New York, a man he calls Sadik who “had overstayed his tourist visa and now made a living in New York’s high-turnover, illegal immigrant work force, waiting on tables.” 
Mr. Obama, the campaign and his publisher have not provided any details about the identity of Sadik. 
 During his years at Occidental College, Mr. Obama also befriended Wahid Hamid, a fellow student who was an immigrant from Pakistan and traveled with Mr. Obama there, the Obama campaign said. Mr. Hamid is now a vice president at Pepsico in New York, and according to public records, has donated the maximum $2,300 to the Obama campaign and is listed as a fund-raiser for it.
Mr. Chandoo is now a self-employed financial consultant, living in Armonk, N.Y. He has also donated the maximum, $2,300, to Mr. Obama’s primary campaign and an additional $309 for the general election, campaign finance records show.
The Footsteps column on March 30, about seeing Prague through the perspective of Milan Kundera’s “The Unbearable Lightness of Being,” misidentified an airline that offers direct flights from New York to Prague. It is Czech Airlines, not Delta. (Under an agreement, Delta can sell tickets for these flights, but the flights are operated by Czech Airlines.)
Today we start with a declarer-play problem. In the diagram South is in seven spades. West leads the spade four, declarer puts in dummy’s ten, and East plays the three. How should South continue?
 The bidding was unusual. South, after opening one club and hearing partner respond one heart, rebid a strange one spade instead of two no-trump. North jumped to three spades, which was game-forcing, not a modern game-invitational. South used regular Blackwood twice, then bid seven spades. (Roman Key Card Blackwood would have allowed him to find out that the spade queen was missing. Then he could have stopped in a small slam or gambled on seven no-trump.)
 This deal, which occurred during the 1977 Bermuda Bowl in Manila, was in “Trump Leads” by George Rosenkranz (Baron Barclay, 1986). 
 At the other table North-South bid and made six spades. So if South made seven spades, he would gain 11 international match points. But if he failed, he would lose 14 imps.
 Assuming declarer could draw trumps without loss, he had 13 tricks: four spades, four hearts, three diamonds and two clubs. Without a trump lead, he would have played West for the spade queen. But when West led a trump, South was sure that East had that key queen. So after winning the first trick on the board, he called for the spade ace. Imagine his surprise when East discarded.
 Who found this diabolical lead? Mike Passell, who was playing for the Defending Champions team from the United States.
 This result was good news, gaining 14 imps, but bad news followed when Passell’s team lost in the final to the North American Challengers, Billy Eisenberg, Bob Hamman, Eddie Kantar, Paul Soloway, John Swanson and Bobby Wolff.
 Should declarer have seen through Passell’s imaginative lead? Probably not. But if he was confident that West would not lead a trump from three to the queen, South should have continued not with dummy’s spade ace, but with its spade six.
 If East followed suit, declarer would put in his nine, taking a second trump finesse in a grand slam without playing the ace or the king.
 Here, though, East would discard, so South would win with his king, finesse through West and claim.
 This was the full deal: (See diagram 2).

DETAILS Miraval, about a half hour north of Tucson in the Sonoran Desert, is known as one of the country’s top destination spas. The resort, with 102-rooms at the base of the Catalina Mountains, draws guests with a variety of treatments like watsu (water shiatsu) massages, mud wraps and prickly pear sugar scrubs, and also offers many options for activities including yoga, cooking classes, hiking, mountain biking and horseback riding. To build on its popularity, the resort is adding 26 duplex and free-standing villas on its 400 acres. Ten of the villas will be set aside to become part of Exclusive Resorts, a destination club headed by Steve Case, the co-founder of America Online, who is also the majority owner of Miraval. With two or three bedrooms, the villas are about 2,600 to nearly 3,000 square feet indoors, and all include large amounts of outdoor space  patios with plunge pools and outdoor living and cooking areas with fire pits. Other features include outdoor showers, fireplaces in the living rooms and master bedrooms, and floor-to-ceiling windows. Owners will be required to pay at least $16,000 in annual dues. With that fee will come four weeks of meals, drinks, spa treatments and activities for two people; additional fees bring more time. The resort has four pools, a fitness center and tennis courts. Owners will be assigned a personal adviser to assist with treatments and activities, and there will be concierges to help with arrangements like golf at a nearby Tom Weiskopf-designed course and transfers to and from the Tucson airport.

 District 3, eastern New York (excluding New York City) and northern New Jersey, played its final qualifying match on May 18. Kerri and Steve Sanborn of Stony Point, N.Y., and Irina Levitina of Hackensack, N.J., and Ilya Levitin of Emerson, N.J. (who are sister and brother) played against Stasha and Mark Cohen of Glen Ridge, N.J.; Rozanne and Bill Pollack of Basking Ridge, N.J.; Josh Parker of Briarcliff, N.Y.; and Bruce Rogoff of Upper Grandview, N.Y.
 The diagramed deal decided the match.
 At the other table the Cohens played in three hearts by West, going down only one when the defense dropped a trick.
 In the given auction Steve Sanborn (West) opened one heart, Rozanne Pollack (North) overcalled two clubs, Kerri Sanborn (East) passed, and Bill Pollack (South) passed. Now West, although he might have worried about the spade suit, balanced with two hearts. The spade fear was not realized, but after North competed with three clubs, South, with scattered values, some club fit and heart stoppers, took a shot at three no-trump. At the least, this was a good psychological call, given that West could have left them floating in two clubs.
 West led the diamond deuce. Declarer took East’s jack with his king and returned a diamond, hoping the suit would be 3-3. West won with his ace and led back the diamond ten to dummy’s queen, East discarding a spade.
 Now South had to keep East off the lead; otherwise a heart lead through declarer would give the defense five tricks: two hearts, two diamonds and East’s entry card. This meant that West had to have the club queen.
 Declarer cashed dummy’s club ace. If the queen had not appeared, South would have continued with a low club to his jack. But when the queen did fall, West was marked with 2-6-4-1 distribution. South played a club to his jack, West discarding the heart ten, and took dummy’s two top spades to give this position (see Diagram 1):
 Pollack cashed dummy’s club king (throwing a spade from his hand), knowing that West was caught in a rare “one-suit squeeze.”
 When West threw the heart three, South led dummy’s diamond, pitching his last spade.
 West, endplayed with his diamond eight, exited with the heart nine. But declarer won with his jack and returned a low heart to endplay West again. Pollack scored the last trick, his ninth, with the heart king.
 Minus 100 and plus 600 gave the Pollack team 11 international match points en route to victory by 10 imps.
 Now let’s go back to the partial diagram. Suppose under the club king West had discarded the heart nine, retaining A-Q-8-3. West, after being endplayed with his diamond, would have led the heart eight. But declarer would have won with his jack and played the heart king to stop East from claiming the last three tricks with her heart seven, club ten and spade jack. West would have won with his ace and cashed the heart queen, but South would have taken a noteworthy last trick with his heart five over West’s three.
ATLANTIC CITY (AP)  The Trump Marina Hotel Casino is being sold for $316 million to a New York company that plans to rename it Margaritaville.
The buyer, Coastal Marina, an affiliate of Coastal Development, said on Thursday that it was buying the casino from Trump Entertainment Resorts, the casino company founded by the real estate magnate Donald J. Trump.
After the sale, Trump Entertainment will have two remaining casinos here: The Trump Taj Mahal Casino Resort and Trump Plaza Hotel and Casino.
Richard T. Fields, chairman of Coastal Marina, said the casino would take on a new identity once the sale closed. No timetable was given.
“Together with Jimmy Buffett’s team at Margaritaville, our plans are to create an exciting new property that we believe will tap its full potential and make it one of the most successful destination gaming resorts in Atlantic City,” Mr. Fields said.
Mr. Fields is the co-developer of the Seminole Hard Rock Hotel and Casino in Florida, and also owns a ranching company, Jackson Land and Cattle in Jackson Hole, Wyo..
Trump Marina was the lowest performing of Trump’s three Atlantic City properties. In the city’s marina district, it was dwarfed by the market leaders  and marina district neighbors  the Borgata Hotel Casino & Spa, and Harrah’s Atlantic City.
In the first quarter of this year, Trump Marina reported a 48.2 percent drop in gross operating profit, to $4.8 million.
The sale marks the conclusion of an on-again, off-again courtship that Trump Entertainment Resorts has been holding with potential suitors for the last year. At least two earlier deals to sell all or part of the company fell through.
 Mark Juliano, Trump Entertainment’s chief executive, said cash from the sale would help the company improve its two remaining properties as well as enable it to consider opportunities outside of Atlantic City.
At the trial in Palm Beach Gardens, Fla., to select the United States open team for the next world championship in Beijing in October, the two-day, 120-board final starts on Thursday.
In the semifinals, which began on Tuesday, the top seeds, Aubrey Strul, Michael Becker, David Berkowitz, Larry Cohen, Chip Martel and Lew Stansby, played against George Jacobs, Ralph Katz, Bobby Levin, Steve Weinstein, Zia Mahmood and Michael Rosenberg.
The second seeds, Nick Nickell, Dick Freeman, Chris Compton, Bob Hamman, Jeff Meckstroth and Eric Rodwell, took on Roy Welland, Chris Willenken, Steve Garner and Howard Weinstein.
The diagramed deal was the 34th of the semifinals. At all four tables the contract was four hearts on a low-club lead, but only Garner made the contract.
At the other three tables declarer won the first trick and cashed the two top trumps, which was fatal with this distribution. Declarer now tried to take the three club winners, discarding diamonds from the North hand, but West ruffed the last one with the heart ten. Declarer overruffed with the heart jack and played a spade to the jack, but West won with his ace, cashed the heart queen and shifted to a diamond, giving the defense one spade, one heart and two diamonds for down one.
Garner (South) did much better, cashing only one top trump before turning to clubs. He played all three winners, discarding dummy’s diamonds. West, after ruffing the last club, switched to a diamond, but declarer ruffed on the board, played a heart to his king, trumped his last diamond and led a spade to his jack. West could take only the spade ace and heart queen to go with the earlier trump trick.
Plus 50 and plus 420 gave the Jacobs team 10 well-deserved international match points. And note that if West had had one fewer heart and one more minor-suit card, Garner’s line would still have succeeded.

The final of the trial to pick the United States open team for the first World Mind Sports Games in Beijing next October was scheduled to conclude Friday evening in Palm Beach Gardens, Fla. The 120-board match was between the top-seeded team of Aubrey Strul, Michael Becker, David Berkowitz, Larry Cohen, Chip Martel and Lew Stansby and the second seeds: Nick Nickell, Dick Freeman, Chris Compton, Bob Hamman, Jeff Meckstroth and Eric Rodwell. 
Details are at usbf.org. 
In the semifinals, Nickell beat the Roy Welland team by 245 international match points to 209. Strul defeated the George Jacobs team by 267 imps to 214. Captain Strul played his role in the diagramed deal, which was Board 74. 
In the other room, the auction was identical, except that Cohen (East) did not double. 
Berkowitz (West) might have led a heart, trying to find his partner’s suit, but he selected the spade eight, second-highest from a weak suit. Michael Rosenberg (South for the Jacobs team) took 11 tricks  four spades, two hearts, three diamonds and two clubs  after squeezing East in the red suits. 
In the given auction, Bobby Levin (East for the Jacobs team) risked a double, asking his partner, Steve Weinstein, to lead his shorter major. This would have worked brilliantly if the North and South heart holdings had been exchanged. 
East won the first trick with his heart king and returned the suit to South’s queen. Strul played a spade to dummy’s ten and a diamond to his jack. Then declarer led his club ten, losing to East’s ace. Back came another heart, South discarding a club. Declarer cashed two rounds of spades to reach this end position: (Diagram 1)
Note that East discarded the diamond ten, trying to look like someone who has bared the king. Declarer cashed his last spade, pitching a club from the board and squeezing East. 
When East threw a heart, declarer exited with the club queen. East won with his king and cashed the heart seven, on which declarer discarded clubs from his hand and the board. Now East had to lead away from the diamond king into South’s split tenace. 
Minus 660 and plus 750 gave the Strul team 3 imps on the board. 
Strul played for South Africa in the 1972 World Team Olympiad. The event in Beijing is replacing the Team Olympiad. Strul, who now lives in Delray Beach, Fla., and Becker played half of the 120 semifinal boards. On those, their team gained 93 imps.
ABERDEEN, Scotland — Donald Trump argued his case Tuesday for the construction of a $2 billion golf resort on a stretch of coast in northeast Scotland after months of acrimony between the billionaire developer and local residents.
Trump was in a bullish mood as he faced a panel of planners and lawyers for environmentalists during a public hearing in Aberdeen. He said his golf course would be the greatest in the world - better than Turnberry, Carnoustie, Troon or the Royal & Ancient Golf Club at St. Andrews.
"The sight has superb topography and who's to disagree it has great vistas and magnificent views," Trump said.
He wants to build the course at the Menie Estate, 12 miles, or 19 kilometers, north of Aberdeen. The development has divided political opinion in Scotland and embroiled the first minister in a dispute about overstepping his jurisdiction in planning law.
The plans to create a course on a legally protected site of scientific interest have been met with opposition from local environmentalists and a landowner who steadfastly refuses to sell his property. A local fisherman, Michael Forbes, refused the offer from the Trump Organization of £350,000, or $690,000, for his family's small, run-down farm in the center of the estate.
The proposals for two golf courses, 900 timeshare apartments, a 450-bed hotel and 500 luxury homes were narrowly rejected by the Aberdeenshire Council late last year after local residents and conservationists said one course should not be built on the Foveran Links, a stretch of shifting sand dunes that are home to some of the rarest wildlife in Scotland, including skylarks, kittiwakes, badgers and otters.
But local business leaders, tourism agencies and the nationalist First Minister Alex Salmond approve of the development, which could bring much-needed jobs and money to the area.
Under cross-examination by the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds, Trump drew snickers from the audience when he said that he knew more about the environment than his consultants did. He acknowledged that he had not read the environmental reports that he had commissioned.
Trump said that the moveable sand dunes would benefit from having a golf course on them as they would be stabilized and would not blow away in a storm. He was facing a panel of three senior planning officials, appointed by the Salmond government, and lawyers representing environmental agencies.
WASHINGTON  One was an oilman from Texas, the other a high-paid energy executive. Despite that, or perhaps because of it, for seven years George W. Bush and Dick Cheney have been unable to persuade Congress and the public that domestic oil drilling is an answer to America’s energy needs.
With the clock running down on his presidency, Mr. Bush made one last push Wednesday by calling on Congress to end the 27-year moratorium on most offshore drilling. With oil at more than $130 a barrel, gasoline over $4 a gallon and the broader economy threatened, the White House is betting it can finally break a decades-old Washington deadlock between those who favor domestic oil exploration and those who say conservation is the key.
The question is whether Americans are feeling enough pain at the pump to force their elected leaders to go along, and whether it will make any real difference if they do.
“If Congressional leaders leave for the Fourth of July recess without taking action, they will need to explain why $4-a-gallon gasoline is not enough incentive for them to act,” Mr. Bush said Wednesday in the White House Rose Garden. “And Americans will rightly ask how high oil  how high gas prices have to rise before the Democratic-controlled Congress will do something about it.”
 Other Republicans, notably Senator John McCain, the party’s presumptive presidential nominee, are abandoning their long-held opposition to drilling in coastal waters. Newt Gingrich, former speaker of the House, recently posted an online petition, headlined “Drill Here, Drill Now,” to strengthen support for domestic oil exploration, and gathered 650,000 signatures in two weeks.
“My prediction is that unless oil prices go down below $60 a barrel, you are now at a fundamental turning point at which you will see a new political coalition emerge,” Mr. Gingrich said in an interview. “This is a huge populist issue, and politicians who ignore it do so at their own peril.”
But Democrats do not feel especially imperiled. Although one moderate Democrat  Senator Mary L. Landrieu of Louisiana, who has long advocated expanding drilling in the Gulf of Mexico  is drafting legislation aimed at increasing domestic production, the leadership is holding fast. Speaker Nancy Pelosi of California said Wednesday, “We cannot drill our way to energy independence.”
If anything, Democrats say, the White House action gives them a chance to paint Mr. Bush as beholden to the oil industry and Mr. McCain as a clone of Mr. Bush, a message that will only grow louder as the November election draws near.
“To have President Bush be the face of this issue for the Republicans means having the worst possible spokesman,” said Geoff Garin, a Democratic strategist who helped run Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton’s presidential campaign.
 “What Republicans are doing for themselves right now,” Mr. Garin added, “is deepening the impression that they are the party of Big Oil.”
Whether $4-a-gallon gasoline is producing more support for domestic drilling is hard to discern. A Gallup poll conducted last month found that 57 percent of those surveyed favored drilling for oil in coastal and wilderness areas that are now off limits, but there are no earlier data for comparison. In March, before the latest spike in gasoline prices, a Pew Research Center survey found that 50 percent opposed drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, in Alaska, while 42 percent were in favor. 
Mr. Bush has long supported the proposal to drill along a coastal strip of the refuge. But he has not before taken up the cause of offshore drilling, partly because it was such a hot-button issue in the state of Florida, where his brother Jeb was governor. Congress first adopted its moratorium against drilling on the outer continental shelf, 3 to 200 miles offshore, in 1981. In 1990, Mr. Bush’s father signed an executive order reinforcing the ban; Mr. Bush promised Wednesday to rescind the order if Congress ended its moratorium.
In the Rose Garden, the president made the case that in the long run, the solution to high prices was to reduce demand for oil by promoting alternative-energy technologies, a view widely shared across the political spectrum. But “in the short run,” he said, “the American economy will continue to rely largely on oil, and that means we need to increase supply, especially here at home.”
The federal Energy Information Administration estimates that 18 billion barrels of oil are in the area covered by the moratorium, and the White House says that is enough to match current American production for 10 years. But a 2007 analysis by the agency concluded that opening up drilling in the moratorium area “would not have a significant impact on domestic crude oil and natural gas production or prices before 2030.”
The primary concern about offshore drilling has been that unsightly oil rigs would dampen tourism, or that spills would threaten the environment. Advocates, and even critics, say new technology has greatly reduced the risk of spills. But David B. Sandalow, an energy expert at the Brookings Institution in Washington who advises Democrats, argues that the amount of oil that could be recovered is so small as not to be worth the environmental risk.
“It’s like walking an extra 20 feet a day to lose weight,” he said. “It’s just not enough to make a difference.”
But Robin West, who managed the offshore leasing program for the Reagan administration and is now chairman of PFC Energy, a consulting company, argues that additional supply could make a difference in price, especially if domestic drilling were coupled with aggressive conservation efforts. He said it would take time, though  a minimum of five or six years, even if drilling were to begin today.
“A logical energy policy,” Mr. West said, “is to encourage production and discourage consumption. And prices will go down.”
But with just seven months left in his presidency, the relationship between Mr. Bush and Congressional Democrats is already set, and unlikely to produce fresh agreement on what might be a logical energy policy, especially in the thick of a presidential election season.
As Vin Weber, a Republican former congressman from Minnesota, said: “I think we have been deadlocked on energy over ideological concerns for a long time, and the urgency in the country was not there to break out of this debate. And now the urgency of the country is there, and it’s too late for this administration.”
The trial to select the United States senior team for the first World Mind Sports Games in Beijing in October started on Monday and will end Thursday, in Sturbridge, Mass.
The first day’s play reduced the field of 10 teams to 8. This was followed by three days of 60-board knockout matches to decide the winners.
In the semifinals Reese Milner, Grant Baze, Billy Eisenberg, Sam Lev, Russ Ekeblad and Ron Rubin took on Steve Robinson, Peter Boyd, Fred Stewart and Kit Woolsey. And John Onstott, Drew Casen, Dan Morse and Bobby Wolff played against James Tritt, Bob Etter, Farid Assemi, Edward Wojewoda, Keith Garber and Jim Looby.
 Results are at usbf.org, and play in the final can be seen at www.bridgebase.com.
 Two of the quarterfinals were very close. The team captained by Carolyn Lynch won each of the first three quarters against Robinson to lead by 88 international match points to 73, but lost the last session by 23. Rose Meltzer’s team entered the last quarter against Tritt down by 12 imps. The match was decided by the diagramed deal, which was Board 51.
 The given auction to five diamonds was by Garber (South) and Looby. The two-heart raise by Roger Bates (East) was known to be weak. He would have responded two diamonds with a decent single raise.
 Alan Sontag (West) led the heart queen. Declarer took the trick with his ace, drew two rounds of trumps ending in his hand and played a club.
 West should have ducked this trick because if, after winning with the king on the board, South crossed to hand with a trump and played another club, he would then go down. West would win with the ace and play a heart to East’s king. East would exit with a club, leaving declarer stranded in the dummy. South could not get back to hand to take the spade finesse and ruff his club loser on the board. Yes, declarer could survive by taking the spade finesse after drawing the last trump, but ducking the club ace would have been a stronger defense.
 West, though, rose with his club ace and cashed a heart, leaving South with the rest when the spade finesse won.
 In the other room, over the double by Bart Bramley (North), Assemi (East) bid two diamonds to show a weak heart raise. Lew Stansby (South) doubled, Wojewoda (West) rebid two hearts and North doubled again to indicate extra values. Now South jumped to three no-trump, hoping to have nine running tricks.
 After West led the heart queen, the defense was accurate, holding declarer to his eight tricks: two spades, one heart and five diamonds. Plus 600 and plus 100 gave the Tritt team 12 imps on the board, 3 more than its winning margin.
 At another table Wolff made three no-trump. After taking the first trick with his heart ace, he ran the diamond suit. West, thinking he had to retain three spades, discarded one club and three hearts. But now Wolff could knock out the club ace because the defense had only three heart tricks to cash.

In Monday’s column, when Nick Nickell opened one heart and the next player made a takeout double, Dick Freeman could not respond one spade, because it would have shown a good raise to two hearts.
There are two premier events at the Edgar Kaplan Eastern States Regional in New York, and traditionally each takes up a share of the Memorial Day weekend. On Saturday and Sunday the Goldman Pairs is contested. On Monday the Reisinger Knockout Teams usually begins, running for the rest of the week. This year, though, because of the United States open team trial, the Reisinger was moved forward by a week.
 In the 52-board final played on May 23, Richard DeMartino of Riverside, Conn.; William Ehlers of Jersey City; and John Fout, Michael Kopera, John Ramos and John Rengstorff of New York defeated David Gurvich, Michael Lipkin and Henry Wong of New York; Alex Perlin of Metuchen, N.J.; Michael Prahin of Irvington, N.Y.; and Daniel Wilderman of New Haven.
 The diagramed deal from the final highlights an important defensive technique.
 Both tables were in three no-trump by South after North opened light with one club. In the other room North and South were playing the Polish Club system, so North’s opening bid would usually be based on a balanced 12 to 14 points, perhaps with only a doubleton club. And since Fout (East) did not overcall one heart, Kopera (West) led the club deuce.
 If declarer had taken this trick on the board with the ace and called for a spade, East would have had to win with his ace and return the club jack to defeat the contract. But South took the trick in his hand and played the spade jack, making it easy for East to win and lead his remaining club. The defense took two spades, one diamond and two clubs.
 When Ehlers was the declarer, East had thrown in a thin one-heart overcall. South started nicely, overtaking dummy’s heart jack with his queen and leading the spade ten, trying to look like someone finessing against the spade jack. West ought to have won with his king and led a second heart, but he played low. East took the trick and persevered with a heart.
 Now declarer, who had already decided to play East for the ace and queen of diamonds, called for dummy’s diamond ten. East erred fatally when he played low. The diamond ten won the trick, and South led another diamond from the board. East rose with his ace and played a heart, but South won and led another spade. Now declarer had 10 tricks: two spades, three hearts, three diamonds and two clubs.
 Plus 50 and plus 430 gave the winners 10 international match points on the board.
 East should have covered the diamond ten with his queen. South would have won with his king but would have been in the wrong hand to dislodge East’s diamond-ace entry. If declarer played a club to dummy’s ace and called for a diamond, East could win with his ace and return his second club, establishing West’s suit while he, West, still had the spade king as an entry.
 When you are defending against no-trump and declarer has only one stopper left in your partner’s long suit, do whatever you can to win the next defensive trick. You then lead partner’s suit to establish it while he, with luck, still has a timely entry.
Look at the West hand and the auction. What would you lead against six hearts?
 The team that will represent District 24, New York City and Long Island, in the Grand National Teams in Las Vegas next month will be Franco Baseggio, John Fout, Michael Kopera, Jim Krekorian, John Rengstorff and Andrew Stark, all of New York.
 In the final of the qualifying event, played on June 8, they defeated Gail Greenberg, Jeffrey Hand, Robert Blanchard, Shane Blanchard and Aviv Shahaf of New York and Igor Savchenko of Morris Plains, N.J., by 21 international match points.
 The diagramed deal was decisive.
 At the other table the auction began the same way, but Krekorian (South) decided to rebid a game-forcing two no-trump over the two-diamond reverse (which promised a strong hand) because two hearts would normally have been the first move with a very weak responding hand. Rengstorff (North) raised to three no-trump, ending the auction.
 West led a heart, and declarer took 10 tricks: one spade, four hearts, three diamonds and two clubs.
 The Blanchards, father and son, were more ambitious, reaching the good six-heart contract on the 4-3 fit. Note that Robert (South) knew that his son had only three hearts because with 0-4-4-5 distribution he would have rebid two hearts, not two diamonds.
 Now Fout (West) had to lead. If he had selected, say, a spade, declarer, with some care and attention, would probably have made the contract by collecting these 12 tricks: 1 spade, 2 diamonds, 2 clubs, 3 spade ruffs on the board and 4 trump tricks in hand.
 But after a lot of thought Fout found the most awkward lead of a trump.
 South won with his jack, unblocked the club king, played a spade to dummy’s ace and cashed the club ace, discarding a diamond from his hand. A club ruff established dummy’s last two clubs and left declarer, who was hoping hearts were 3-3, envisioning these 12 tricks: 1 spade, 1 spade ruff, 3 hearts, 2 diamonds, 4 clubs and the club ruff. So South ruffed a spade on the board with the heart ace and took his two top trumps. If both opponents had followed throughout, declarer would have claimed, but when East discarded, South played a diamond to dummy’s queen and cashed the diamond ace. He conceded the last three tricks for down two.
 Plus 430 and plus 100 gave the winners 11 imps on the board. But if South had made six hearts for plus 980, it would have been 11 imps the other way, a difference of 22 imps. And remember that the final margin was only 21 imps.
 Could South have done better?
 He could have made six hearts after the trump lead only if he were looking at all 52 cards. He must take the first trick in his hand and immediately play a diamond to dummy’s queen. When it holds, he continues with the spade ace, a club to the king, a spade ruff on the board, the club ace (discarding a spade from his hand), a club ruff and a spade ruff with the heart ace to give this position (Diagram 2):
 South leads dummy’s club ten, discarding his last spade. How can West defend?
 If he ruffs and plays a trump, declarer draws trumps, discarding two diamonds from the board, and the dummy is high. If West ruffs and leads a diamond, it sacrifices a trick in that suit. Finally, if West discards, South cashes dummy’s diamond ace and has two top trumps for his contract.
WHO can blame Donald Trump for wanting to build overseas?
His home turf, New York City, has become dependent on foreigners who are taking advantage of favorable exchange rates to buy everything from DVDs to penthouses.
“I always liked the sound of a strong dollar until I looked at the bottom line,” Mr. Trump said during a speech last month to several thousand hotel investors at the Waldorf-Astoria hotel. But if a strong dollar returns, he said, “business is going to stop coming to New York.”
Mr. Trump says he is still committed to New York, where his newest property is the Trump SoHo hotel and condominium tower, which is expected to open next year. But he is devoting more of his time to overseas projects, including buildings in India, South Korea, Turkey, Egypt and the United Arab Emirates. In a recent telephone interview, he described each project as the “biggest” and the “best.” 
One project, which seems particularly close to Mr. Trump’s heart, hangs in the balance. Two years ago, he announced plans to build what he calls the world’s greatest golf resort on the northeast coast of Scotland, near Aberdeen. The resort, estimated to cost about $2 billion, would include 1,000 condos, 500 luxury villas, a hotel and two golf courses, on 1,400 waterfront acres.
But the project has outraged environmentalists , who say the site chosen by Mr. Trump  with several miles of rugged coastline  should be left undisturbed.
Last year, the government of Aberdeenshire  the 2,400-square-mile district in which the site is located  rejected Mr. Trump’s proposal. But the Scottish cabinet, which has the power to review planning decisions, scheduled a hearing on the plan. In an effort to revive the project, which he says will bring thousands of jobs to the area, Mr. Trump appeared at the Aberdeen Exhibition and Conference Center on June 10, the first day of the hearing. The cabinet is expected to announce its decision later in the summer.
During his two-and-a-half-hour appearance, Mr. Trump praised the site  which is in Balmedie, 13 miles north of Aberdeen  for its natural beauty. But when the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds argued that the landscape should be preserved, according to accounts in the British press, Mr. Trump said that 25,000 birds were being shot each year over his property and that residents were dumping garbage there. 
“It’s a total mess,” Mr. Trump was quoted in The Guardian as saying. “When you walk on the site right now it’s sort of disgusting. There are bird carcasses lying all over the place. There are dead animals all over the site that have been shot. There may be some people that are into that. I am not.”
Mr. Trump later added: “It’s a killing field. They’re shooting birds. And all we’re going to do is shoot birdies and eagles.”
According to British press accounts, David Tyldesley, a planner hired by the Scottish Wildlife Trust, asked Mr. Trump about Scottish “rambler laws” that would allow birdwatchers and hikers to walk across the site. 
Mr. Trump told the inquiry that golfers “would have a problem with people walking all over the course.” Ramblers, he added, could get hit by a golf ball, or break a leg and sue him. (Back in New York, Mr. Trump said, “We go by the laws of Scotland.”)
He was perhaps most combative when he was asked by Martin Ford, a member of the Aberdeenshire Council and an opponent of the project, how he had managed to buy the land without knowing it had been classified by Scotland as a Site of Special Scientific Interest. “You have little understanding of the property you bought or the environmental status of it,” Mr. Ford told him, according to a report by The Associated Press.
According to the Guardian account, Mr. Trump, who said he did know about the site’s designation, replied: “You know, it’s interesting, nobody has ever told me I don’t know how to buy property before. You’re the first one. I appreciate your advice.”
According to reporters at the hearing, Mr. Trump provoked guffaws when he told the inquiry that his proposed golf resort would “enhance” rather than harm the sand dunes. “I consider myself to be an environmentalist in the true sense of the word,” Mr. Trump said.
When asked about compromising the plan to save some of the dunes, Mr. Trump was adamant that there would be no half-measures. The press took that as a sign that Mr. Trump was going to build the resort his way  or not at all.
THE press even criticized his visit to the Scottish Isle of Lewis  where his mother, Mary MacLeod, grew up  as a public relations stunt. (Just before the hearing, Mr. Trump flew to Lewis on his private jet with his sister, Maryanne Trump Barry, a federal judge. A bagpiper greeted them at the airport.) 
Back in New York, Mr. Trump, whose mother left Scotland as a young woman, said he believed that he had swayed the Scottish public. “It went very nicely,” he said in a telephone interview. “I think we won all of our points.” 
Mr. Trump added that people have called him “brilliant” because he agreed to buy the Scottish site in dollars, before the dollar plummeted in relation to the pound. “I love being called brilliant,” he said, before explaining that his “currency play” was unintentional. “Really,” he said, “dollars are the only thing I deal in.”
Asked if the main street through the Aberdeen project would be named Trump Boulevard, as some British newspapers have reported, he said he hadn’t decided. He added: “But that sounds pretty good to me.”

The press even criticized his visit to the Scottish Isle of Lewis - where his mother, Mary MacLeod, grew up - as a public relations stunt. (Just before the hearing, Trump flew to Lewis on his private jet with his sister, Maryanne Trump Barry, a U.S. judge. A bagpiper greeted them at the airport.)
Back in New York, Trump, whose mother left Scotland as a young woman, said he believed that he had swayed the Scottish public. "It went very nicely," he said in an interview by phone. "I think we won all of our points."
Trump added that people have called him brilliant because he agreed to buy the Scottish site in dollars, before the dollar plummeted in relation to the pound. "I love being called brilliant," he said, before explaining that his "currency play" was unintentional. "Really," he said, "dollars are the only thing I deal in."
Asked whether the main street through the Aberdeen project would be named Trump Boulevard, as some British newspapers have reported, he said he hadn't decided. He added: "But that sounds pretty good to me."
A WHILE back, Naomi Johnson, a communications professor at Longwood University in Virginia, sent me her doctoral thesis, which she described as a feminist analysis of the new wave of teenage romance novels. I don’t read lots of dissertations, and almost tossed this one when the words “ontological,” “objectivist” and “constructivist” appeared in the same sentence, on Page 38. But I kept at it, because one of the series for teenagers that Dr. Johnson analyzed was the best-selling “Clique” books, which my 14-year-old daughter, Annie, loves and we buy the moment the newest one hits the bookstore.
As others have, Dr. Johnson questions the female characters’ preoccupation with looks, thinness, fashion, makeup, wealth  we’re talking spoiled, rich middle-school girls from Westchester County. But what grabbed me as new was her documentation of what she called the “incessant litany of brand names.” She examined three series, with combined sales of 13.5 million  “Clique,” “Gossip Girl” and “A-List”  and found, on average, there was more than one brand mentioned per page, 1,553 brand mentions in 1,431 pages of the six books she had read.
Massie, the lead “Clique” character, doesn’t wear miniskirts and sandals. She wears Moschino minis, Jimmy Choo sandals, and Chanel No. 19 on her thin wrists, rides in a Range Rover, drinks Glaceau Vitamin Water and totes her books in a Louis Vuitton backpack.
Dr. Johnson concluded that romancing boys was no longer the primary objective of this new generation of romance novels, as it had been in the good old days of the 184-book series “Sweet Valley High.”
In the new romances, she wrote, “brands are more important than romantic relationships to female protagonists’ popularity.”
“Heroines no longer become women through romance, they become feminine through consumption.”
Indeed, you can often tell the bad guys by their unfortunate brand choices. The beautiful heroine of the “A-List” series, Anna, drives a Lexus (mentioned seven times in Chapter 1 of “American Beauty”) and wears a Molinari dress and Sigerson Morrison sandals. The poor thing gets in a car crash with some idiot middle-aged woman in a rusty Honda Civic, whose gray roots are showing and  here you may want to exercise parental discretion  who is wearing a bad Chanel knockoff scarf.
But the most worrisome issue Dr. Johnson raises is whether these fashion companies paid the book publishers to have their products mentioned. The three series were written by different authors, but were created and packaged by Alloy Media and Marketing and then sold to Little, Brown publishers. One of Alloy’s chief revenue streams is product placement. As Alloy says on its Web site, it is very good at reaching the pre-teen and teenage audience  through ads in student publications, ads on hot Internet sites, even ads in school bathrooms.
Had the fashion companies paid Alloy to have their products named in these books? Dr. Johnson was concerned because of a posting on Alloy’s Web site in 2006: “Advertisers have the opportunity to get their products or services cast in these best-selling books. The value of these mentions far exceeds the hundreds of thousands of readers, creating a viral product buzz.”
Dr. Johnson says she e-mailed Alloy about its policy, but got no response.
The author of the “Clique” series, Lisi Harrison, as well as representatives of Alloy and Little, Brown all responded to my calls. They were adamant that there had never been any paid placements. “There was no product placement in any of those books, nothing,” said Les Morgenstein, president of Alloy Entertainment, a division of Alloy Media. “We never had any cross-promotion deals, no barter exchanges, nothing.”
Mr. Morgenstein said that the 2006 Web posting had been from another Alloy division. “They had at one point thought this could be an opportunity for our books, but nothing ever came of it,” he said. “No brand ever expressed interest.”
 He said that there is paid product placement for the “Gossip Girl” television series on the CW network. And both he and Megan Tingley, the publisher of Little, Brown Books for Young Readers, said that while they had never done paid product placement in any book, they would not rule it out in the future. Both said that if they ever did, “transparency” would be essential. “We would make it clear that’s the case,” Ms. Tingley said.
I asked Ms. Harrison, the “Clique” author, why, then, her books named brands so often. “Details are what make the books seem so real for these girls,” she said. “It feels very current, like one of them wrote it. It’s actually the stuff they’re talking about.”
Originally, she saw it as satirical, she said, a kind of “over-the-top absurdity.” She says that growing up in Toronto (for the record, she has never lived in Westchester, just visited a few times for weddings), she was never permitted designer clothes: “To this day I’ve never bought any high-brand designer clothing.”
Critics, including Naomi Wolf in The New York Times Book Review, disparaged the books for focusing on girls with such bad values, but Ms. Harrison says that just because a popular, fashion-obsessed mean girl is the protagonist, that doesn’t mean those are the author’s values. “Massie’s a bully,” Ms. Harrison said. “But she’s insecure. She talks a big game but she can’t deliver. By humanizing the social bully, it shows her weaknesses and makes her less fearsome. It takes some of the power from the mean girls.”
Dr. Johnson doesn’t advocate  as some librarians have  pulling the books off the shelf or stopping your daughter from reading them. “Educators should not ignore the pleasures of reading romance novels,” she wrote. “Or treat adolescents as hapless victims of media influence.” She suggests that parents talk to their daughters about Massie’s values, “versus judging people by their heart and intellect and skills.”
And so, I recently read my first “Clique” book. As has been true with romance novels since the beginning of time, Massie doesn’t just speak, she blurts; Alicia gushes, Dylan snorts, Claire’s blood boils and the horses they ride along Westchester bridle paths have thunderous hooves.
On the other hand, Massie’s boyfriend Chris has eyes the color of a royal blue Polo shirt.
“Frankly, sometimes I found the books really entertaining,” Dr. Johnson told me, and so did I. While I didn’t feel the thrill I had when Annie read “To Kill a Mockingbird” for school, there was nothing in the “Clique” book that gave me pause. At her age, I read a ton of trashy sports books.
The mass media has power, but for my money, a vigilant parent has lots more. Annie may devour every word of Massie’s nastiness, but unlike Massie, Annie plays catcher on her softball team and was the only female trumpet player in the county jazz band this year and is working two part-time jobs this summer.
As for clothes, when she had her eighth-grade stepping-up ceremony last month, we didn’t go to Barneys New York and buy Prada. My wife went down the street, borrowed five dresses from a neighbor and Annie picked the one she liked best.
Still, as Annie strode across the middle-school stage in Mrs. Briffel’s borrowed dress, I couldn’t help noticing her eyes sparkled like Tiffany diamonds. 
Oui, there will be tricolor bunting. Balloons? Certainement. And when “La Marseillaise” is played, diners will be asked to stand. But here is the surprise about Monday evening’s celebration of Bastille Day at Chez Napoléon, the diminutive, cozy, venerable Manhattan bastion of La Belle France at 365 West 50th Street: The bistro will be open.
“Normally, we are closed Mondays in the summer,” said Marguerite Bruno, 87, whom everyone calls “Chef Grand-mère.” 
Already, across the city, there have been grand Francophilic celebrations of vin and fromage, cutthroat pétanque competitions and even a Web site, bastilledaynyc.com, that coordinated all the hoopla for an annual street fête on Sunday on East 60th Street from Fifth to Lexington Avenues. 
But here, “there are no parades; it is not the same as in France,” Ms. Bruno said, brown eyes bright with remembrance. “Ah, the public balls. Right in the streets.” 
For at least a decade after her grandson nailed it to the wall, a small sign near the kitchen of the family-owned restaurant between Eighth and Ninth Avenues proclaimed: “If Mama Ain’t Happy, Ain’t Nobody Happy.” (The sign is now in storage, thanks to wallpapering in progress.) 
The mama in question is, of course, the matriarch of this 44-seat, white-tablecloth universe of chunky pâté, blood sausage and frog legs laced with garlic. 
“Everywhere there is nouvelle, but here there is French tradition,” said René Morel, 76, a violin restorer from Manhattan and a Chez Napoléon loyalist who said he was “too old to remember” when he began coming there. 
He was discussing the 1715 Stradivarius played by his luncheon companion, the globe-trotting violinist Rony Rogoff, 62, who was attacking the artichoke vinaigrette appetizer on a recent afternoon. “When I’m here,” Mr. Rogoff said, “I think I’m eating at Grandma’s.” 
And he is. Even though she commutes to the restaurant from Bellerose, Queens, “This is my home,” Ms. Bruno said. 
It would be difficult to make the case that this unassuming, doughty, 48-year-old trouper is the very soul of France on American soil, but the restaurant is certainly an increasingly rare remnant, a survivor from the lost legion of French bistros on the West Side of Midtown.
“This is French territory,” Ms. Bruno said. 
It has outlived the departure of the old Madison Square Garden, the disrupting construction of Worldwide Plaza up the street, the post-9/11 economic slump and anti-French sentiment, Broadway strikes and the transformation of Hell’s Kitchen to Hell’s Breakfast Nook and its rising rents. 
And because of French restaurant attrition, Chez Napoléon is now the northern bookend in the Theater District to that other, southerly, Chez: the indefatigable Chez Josephine, a French outpost at 414 West 42nd Street. 
But compared with the latter’s oft-venturesome cuisine, Chez Napoléon is so old-school that “sometimes I ask tourists from France why they would want to come here, when they could go anywhere,” said Ms. Bruno’s 36-year-old grandson, William Welles, who holds forth behind the postage stamp of a bar. “They say it is getting hard to find this traditional, home-style fare in France.”
Grand-mère has always done the cooking, but these days, though she still stirs the sauce, she has yielded much of the heavy lifting to her sous-chef, Carlos Cisneros, 45, who has worked with her for 15 years.
This is a kitchen overseen by a grandmother who was taught in turn by her grandmother Julienne Meignen, “and also my aunt, Marie Ribon,” she said. 
And in 1943, in the German-French border town Saarbrücken, it was Ms. Bruno and her aunt who gave some bread and other morsels to an underfed French prisoner, Alfred Bruno, who was toiling in a Nazi work camp. A year later, Ms. Bruno surreptitiously opened the barbed wire at the camp, she said, to permit his escape to Metz. 
They were married in 1945, but no film for the camera was to be had, so their wedding picture could not be taken until later that year. It now hangs on the restaurant wall, and Marguerite’s welcoming face is just the same as it is now, save for a timeworn resemblance to the actresses Simone Signoret and Isabelle Huppert. 
For nine years, Marguerite and Alfred operated L’Hôtel du Puy, a hotel-restaurant in Auron, a ski town in the foothills of the Alps. But since the Brunos were unable to buy the property, and the French economy was crashing, “we decided to come to America,” said Ms. Bruno, who spoke in English and French, with translation by her grandson and her daughter, Elyane, 61, who runs Chez Napoléon and usually answers the phone. 
The Brunos arrived in New York in 1975 and opened a restaurant, L’Esterel, at 58th Street and First Avenue; it closed, and Ms. Bruno cooked in several places before buying the tiny, tidy, busy kitchen at Chez Napoléon in 1982.
“It is so hard to keep our prices reasonable, as the cost of meat and fish go up and up,” Ms. Bruno said. The restaurant, like so many other old-timers, is trying to negotiate a new lease for next year. “Rents are a problem for all of us,” she said. 
On the walls are reproduction French flintlocks, a battered trumpet, a map of Paris in 1578 and Napoleonic murals, some painted by Mr. Bruno, who died in 1992. There are also framed jigsaw puzzles (the restaurant sells a “menu” of puzzles with designs ranging from paintings by Monet to the ocean liner Normandie, from $17 to $22).
 And in one of the two mini dining rooms is a framed facsimile of the Little Corporal’s renowned 1821 letter to the French before his death. “People ask if it is real,” Ms. Bruno said. “If it were real, would we have it on the wall?” 
Her daughter shook her head. “Napoléon,” she said, “his handwriting was very bad.” 
Ms. Bruno padded from the kitchen to the bar and sat before her grandson at the lone seat. “I only started drinking Scotch when I came to America,” she said of her custom of sipping “just one glass of Dewar’s” after the dinner rush. 
“But we are allowed,” her grandson said fondly, “to fill that glass again.”
Kay Ryan  was named the poet laureate of the United States on Thursday. Known for sly, compact poems that revel in wordplay and internal rhymes, Ryan has won poetry prizes for her funny and philosophical work, including awards from the Guggenheim Foundation, the National Endowment for the Arts, and in 1994, the Ruth Lilly Poetry Prize, worth $100,000. Poets, editors, critics and academics around the country offered advice to James Billington , the librarian of Congress, about whom to choose as the nation's 16th poet laureate, succeeding Charles Simic , who was appointed in 2007. Ryan's work has "this quality of simplicity; it's highly accessible poetry," Billington said.
The police in Shreveport, Louisiana, said they had video of a bar brawl in which members of a crew filming an Oliver Stone movie - including the actors Josh Brolin  and Jeffrey Wright  - were arrested. Brolin, Wright and five crew members of the film "W." were arrested last week on misdemeanor charges at the Stray Cat Club. Brolin, who plays President George W. Bush in the film, and Wright, who plays Colin Powell , Bush's former secretary of state, are charged with interfering with the police. The actors had just completed shooting the film, which is loosely based on Bush's life. Officers said they were called to the club after a crew member caused a disturbance. Police reports show that the man was charged with resisting arrest and public intoxication; the four other crew members were booked on similar charges.

Britney Spears  is working on a new album, her label said, as she seeks to rebound from a period of troubling behavior and hospital stints for psychiatric evaluations. Spears has spent much of the past 18 months in the headlines for a divorce, losing custody of her two sons, rehab treatment and erratic behavior.

The real estate market might be slumping, but not for Donald Trump , who sold his Palm Beach, Florida, mansion for $100 million, his spokeswoman said. "In an age of so many people getting hurt in real estate, it shows that you can still do well in real estate," Trump said by phone. His spokeswoman says $100 million is the most ever paid for an estate in the United States, though that claim has not been verified. The Russian billionaire Dmitry Rybolovlev bought the oceanfront home, which Trump bought for about $41 million in 2004.

The Rolling Stones guitarist Ronnie Wood  has entered a rehabilitation facility in Britain for help with alcoholism, said a spokeswoman. Wood, 61, has fought a long battle with alcoholism during his rock 'n' roll career, which started in the 1960s when he played with the Faces. The guitarist had seemed to be in good health in recent years and has developed a second career as an artist. But he has been the focus of feverish newspaper reports about his renewed drinking.

The red Steinway grand piano used by Lang Lang at a New York Philharmonic concert in Central Park this week is on the auction block to raise money for the American Red Cross's relief fund for the earthquake in China. Bidding starts at the $165,000 retail price. The Steinway Model D Concert Grand was completed this year and is one of only two in the world. Lang Lang's performance was its first in a major classical concert. Lang Lang said that he had helped raise $3.5 million for relief from the devastating May 12 quake, which killed nearly 70,000 people, many of them children. The Chinese pianist is from Shenyang, outside the Sichuan area, which was hit hardest by the quake.

The first stone has been laid at the Louvre's new Arts of Islam gallery, the first major modern architectural addition to the museum since its famed glass pyramid was built in the 1980s.  President Nicolas Sarkozy and a major donor for the project, Prince Alwaleed bin Talal  of Saudi Arabia, took part in the ceremony initiating the addition, which includes a shimmering glass wave hanging over a 19th-century courtyard. The project's architects say it resembles a cloud or a flying carpet. The wing, expected to open in 2010, will display a vast collection of Islamic art from the seventh to the 19th century.

K ay Ryan , an award-winning poet, mountain bike rider and self-described "modern hermit," was named the next U.S. poet laureate on Thursday. The Library of Congress announced that the lifelong Californian, whose compressed, metaphysical poetry has been compared to Emily Dickinson's , will succeed Charles Simic  as the 16th U.S. poet laureate, starting in the autumn. The appointment lasts for one year and comes with a $35,000 salary, plus $5,000 for travel and a "splendid office," according to James Billington , librarian of Congress. Her books include "Elephant Rocks," "Say Uncle" and, most recently, "The Niagara River," published by Grove Press in 2005. (For more coverage, go to iht.com/culture.)

"Mad Men," the AMC network's drama set in the advertising world circa 1960, and FX's legal thriller "Damages" became on Thursday the first basic-cable programs to gain best-series nods for the Emmy Awards. The HBO historical drama "John Adams" was the overall front-runner with 23 bids, including a lead-actor nomination for Paul Giamatti's  turn as one of America's founding fathers. "30 Rock," the best comedy Emmy winner last year, was the top nominee among sitcoms with 17 bids. "Mad Men" was the leading drama series contender with 16 nominations. In the lead drama actor category, four of the five nominees were stars of cable shows, including Jon Hamm  of "Mad Men." In the corresponding actress category, three of the slots went to cable series stars, including Glenn Close  of "Damages." The ceremony will be held Sept. 21 and broadcast on ABC.

Mattel said on Friday that its second-quarter profit fell by nearly half as higher costs offset strong sales of toys related to summer movies like “Kung Fu Panda” and the benefit of the weaker dollar. The results still beat Wall Street’s expectations. That, combined with Mattel’s legal victory in a case against the maker of Bratz dolls, sent its shares soaring. The company also said it may raise prices again this spring. Mattel, which makes Barbie, Hot Wheels and Fisher-Price toys, said quarterly profit dropped 48 percent, to $11.8 million, or 3 cents a share, from $22.8 million, or 6 cents a share, a year ago. Revenue rose 11 percent, to $1.11 billion, including a 15 percent rise in international sales that came mainly from the benefit of a weaker dollar. 
 The National Front, the French anti-immigration party, is selling its historic headquarters to a Chinese university to raise cash, the party’s leader, Jean-Marie Le Pen, left, was quoted on Monday as saying. Mr. Le Pen, whose slogan in several presidential campaigns was “Keep France for the French,” confounded predictions by reaching the runoff in the 2002 presidential election. But stinging defeats in last year’s parliamentary vote have left the party deep in the red. The magazine L’Express said on its Web site that Mr. Le Pen believed that the university, which he did not name, wanted to turn the building, in the Paris suburb of St.-Cloud, into a French-language school. He did not give the sale price, but L’Express reported that it would be as much as 15 million euros, or about $22 million. 
Christian Bale, Batman in "The Dark Knight," won't be charged in an alleged assault on his mother and sister, in part because they didn't want to press the matter but also for lack of sufficient evidence, prosecutors have said. The Crown Prosecution Service in London ordered the police not to take any further action, saying there was insufficient evidence to make a conviction realistic. The service said in a statement that it treats domestic incidents seriously, but feels it's important "that the views of complainants are also taken into account when making decisions in such cases." Bale, who denies the allegation, said through his spokeswoman he was relieved the issue had been settled. (AP) 
The worldwide release dates for "Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince" starring Daniel Radcliffe, have been delayed by eight months, to July 2009. The sixth film of the teenage wizard's adventures was supposed to have premiered in November. Alan Horn, president of the Warner Bros. studio, said the decision was made to guarantee the studio a major summer blockbuster in 2009. He also blamed the Hollywood writers' strike, which hit the film industry this year. (BBC) 
Jackson Browne doesn't want John McCain running on anything fueled by his lyrics. The singer-songwriter has sued McCain and the Ohio and national Republican committees in U.S. District Court in Los Angeles, accusing them of using his song "Running on Empty" without his permission. The lawsuit claims the song's use was an infringement of his copyright and will lead people to conclude he endorses McCain. (AP)
Donald Trump will soon be Ed McMahon's landlord. Trump has announced he will save the television personality's Beverly Hills, California, mansion from foreclosure by buying it for an undisclosed amount and leasing it to McMahon. The developer told the Los Angeles Times he doesn't know McMahon personally, but acted out of compassion. McMahon, 85, who was Johnny Carson's sidekick on the "Tonight" show for three decades, has not worked for about 18 months because of a neck injury. He defaulted on $4.8 million in mortgage loans with Countrywide Financial. McMahon's spokesman said that McMahon was "optimistic" the deal would go through. Trump told the Times, "When I was at the Wharton School of Business I'd watch him every night. How could this happen?" The home was listed at $4.6 million last weekend - down from a peak price of $7 million. (AP) 
For most people, going on an international tour with a cast of more than 100 and 20 tons of props and sets may not seem like the best way for a family to bond. But for India's first family of acting, it's been rare time together. The actors Amitabh Bachchan; his son, Abhishek Bachchan, and daughter-in-law, Aishwarya Rai Bachchan, along with other Indian movie stars like Preity Zinta, Madhuri Dixit  and Riteish Deshmukh, have spent the past weeks in the United States on "The Unforgettable Tour," a showcase of Bollywood hit songs. Abhishek Bachchan said, "I don't think we've spent this amount of time and this quality of time for over 10 years." The family has played to packed houses. (AP) 
The annual Bulwer-Lytton Fiction contest for bad writing has produced another collection of painful prose, The Associated Press reported. The competition, sponsored by San Jose State University in California since 1982, invites writers to submit the worst possible opening sentences to imaginary novels. The winner this year compares a New York City street to a romantic relationship. "Theirs was a New York love, a checkered taxi ride burning rubber, and like the city their passion was open 24/7, steam rising from their bodies like slick streets exhaling warm, moist, white breath through manhole covers stamped 'Forged by DeLaney Bros., Piscataway, N.J."' The passage was written by Garrison Spik, 41, a communications director and writer from Washington. The contest, named for Edward George Bulwer-Lytton, whose 1830 novel "Paul Clifford," begins, "It was a dark and stormy night," awards a $250 prize to the winner.
Look at the West hand in the diagramed deal. With neither side vulnerable, South deals and opens one heart. What would you overcall?
 Bridge-playing computer programs are getting better, but slowly. The latest world computer championship took place in Las Vegas during the Summer North American Championships. The 64-board final was contested by the programs that seem to be the strongest, Jack, from the Netherlands (jackbridge.com), and Wbridge5, from France (wbridge5.com).
 Jack began with an 18 international match point advantage from the qualifying stage, but Wbridge5 won by 172 imps to 157.
 Each program had its bidding and declarer-play successes, but the match was decided primarily because Jack lost heavily twice when it bid no-trump without a stopper in an opponent’s suit. First, it bid three no-trump with 10-9-8-6 of spades, losing five spades and the club ace. At the other table Wbridge5 bid and made four hearts to gain 13 imps. 
Then Jack bid three no-trump with the singleton heart jack. Partner Jack drove into six no-trump, doubled and down five, losing six heart tricks. At the other table Wbridge5 bid and made six clubs to gain 19 imps, which was more than the winning margin. (Six diamonds was also unbeatable.)
 Now to the diagramed deal. What would you bid over one heart? Humans would usually overcall two diamonds. They would have two eyes on three no-trump. If partner has the heart ace, the diamond ace and enough to hold spades, three no-trump will be laydown. When you have a good long minor, think of three no-trump.
 But West Wbridge5 bid three diamonds, a weak jump overcall that would normally be based on a six-card suit. North Jack made a negative double, and South Jack bid three no-trump. After West Wbridge5 led the diamond king, the contract could not be made. South Jack could have escaped for down one, taking two spades, five hearts and one diamond, but it immediately played a club, so failed by three tricks.
 At the other table West Jack jumped to four diamonds. North Wbridge5 doubled, which was negative but did not promise four spades. The double just said that its hand was too strong to pass but that it had no better call available. The higher a negative double is made, the fuzzier its definition. South Wbridge5, with nowhere to go, passed, converting the negative double into a penalty double. That contract had to fail by three tricks, declarer taking only six diamonds and one club.
 Plus 150 and plus 500 gave Wbridge5 a 12-imp pickup.
Some people like to live behind the 8 ball. 
The sense of impending doom, the getting out of a jam at the last second, creates a rush. Chris Henry, the Cincinnati Bengals’ talented wide receiver, is an 8 ball kind of guy: Since he was drafted by the Bengals in 2005, Henry has been arrested five times and suspended three times by the N.F.L. 
There have been the charges  marijuana possession, concealment of a firearm, providing alcohol to minors. He has offered the customary apologies, the vow to stay on the straight and narrow. But before long, Henry was back behind the 8 ball. 
After a fifth arrest in March on a charge of assaulting a college student, the team had endured enough. The Bengals kicked Henry out. Mike Brown, the owner and general manager, and Marvin Lewis, the coach, were resolute. This was it. Ten Bengals had been arrested over 14 months, and it was time to send a message to the team and to the public. Henry was gone. 
Many critics of the Bengals’ go-soft approach had been waiting for this moment. 
But then T. J. Houshmandzadeh and Chad Johnson, the Bengals’ star receivers, were sidelined with injuries and their young replacements struggled. 
Henry was desperately needed. After the charges against Henry were dismissed following a mistrial, Brown re-signed him, over Lewis’s objections. . 
This was not only a disservice to Henry, who needs time away from the N.F.L. to sort out his life, but it was also an embarrassment to Lewis, who, in a recent Sports Illustrated article, declared that he was drawing the line, taking a stand against disruptive behavior. With ownership’s blessing  he thought  Lewis had agreed to shut the door on Henry. Now he had to take Henry back.
Lewis said he had been fighting Henry’s re-signing since the mistrial. “At the end of the day, he is the owner,” Lewis said of Brown.
How did Lewis feel about the reversal? “My feelings don’t matter,” he said during a telephone interview. “It doesn’t matter. It’s over. I saw that this was something Mike has wanted to do for a while. 
“This does not undercut me. The owner always has the final say, and if you think it’s any other way, you’re fooling yourself.”
The heavy-handed intervention by Brown sends the message that the greater the talent, the higher the tolerance. “We have no discipline in the N.F.L.,” Lewis said. “The only discipline left is not giving them playing time.” 
What about the fines? 
“They don’t care about that,” Lewis said. “The only thing you can take away is playing time. After the first arrest, I sat him down; I didn’t play him. That’s the only thing you have.”
Brown took that option away when he ordered Henry re-signed. 
Was he being benevolent, or pragmatic? During a news conference before training camp began, Brown described himself as a “redeemer.”
“I think people can be made better and right,” he said. “If that’s a fault, so be it.”
If the Bengals really wanted to help Henry, they would have kept him away from football. He has shown that there are issues off the field that he first must deal with.
The latest reinstatement merely reinforces the idea that superior talent will often get you over. This is a message Henry probably began receiving from the moment he demonstrated superior athletic ability. 
“Chris has put himself in such a jam financially,” Lewis said. “Reality has slapped him in the face.” Lewis said that Henry was broke, that he could not pay his rent and that he, Lewis, had to persuade the Bengals to give Henry his signing bonus. This is good for the short term, although now the parasites in Henry’s life will return.
Lewis traced Henry’s problem to Hurricane Katrina. Henry was born in Louisiana and was drafted by the Bengals in April 2005. He reported to camp in July. Katrina struck in August and devastated New Orleans. 
For his family and friends, Henry became the rescue boat; he was FEMA.
After Katrina hit, Henry’s mother and brother  and eventually his brother’s friends, moved to Cincinnati. That was the beginning of Henry’s trouble. “Bad news,” Lewis said about the friends. “They were the ones doing stuff.”
Although Lewis objected to bringing Henry back, he said he had seen signs of maturity. “I was impressed with changes he’s made in his life,” Lewis said.
He is a good person, a likable person, Lewis said. “It’s not like I’m taking Attila the Hun in,” he said. “If you met him, you’d like him.”
So, has he turned the corner? “I can’t tell you that,” Lewis said. “If there was a rock bottom, he’s in it.” 
During a news conference with reporters, Henry told reporters that he had really been scared this time, that this time he really thought the jig was up. In Marvin Lewis’s mind it was.
 “My message has been consistent,” Lewis said. “We’ve got to get the right guy.
“I’ve been asked to give Chris Henry an opportunity to see if he is the right guy. I hope that Chris can do it. There is a lot of risk involved.” 
And in Henry’s life, there always seems to be an 8 ball. 
Richard M. Sudhalter, who won wide respect as a mellifluous trumpet player and perspicacious jazz historian  and ignited controversy for a book arguing that jazz was shaped by white as well as black musicians  died on Friday in Manhattan. He was 69.
The final cause was pneumonia after a long period of declining health, said his partner, Dorothy Kellogg.
Mr. Sudhalter ranged widely across the jazz scene, from critic to concert producer to bandleader to scholar to raconteur to teacher to album annotator. He shared a Grammy in 1982 for notes he and John Chilton wrote for “Bunny Berigan (Giants of Jazz).” He organized the New Paul Whiteman Orchestra; became an admired fixture on the classic-jazz scene, playing with groups that included the short-lived but highly lauded Classic Jazz Quartet; and recorded for Audiophile, Challenge and other labels.
In his 1999 book, “Lost Chords: White Musicians and Their Contribution to Jazz, 1915-1945” (Oxford), he strove to controvert the widely held belief that white players contributed little to the development of jazz. His account began at jazz’s inception in New Orleans, providing captivating accounts of many important soloists, among them Bix Beiderbecke, Benny Goodman, Jack Teagarden, Red Norvo, Bud Freeman, the Dorsey brothers, Bunny Berigan, Pee Wee Russell and Artie Shaw.
Jason Berry, in The New York Times Book Review, praised the book’s “elegant musical analysis” and did not dispute that whites greatly contributed to jazz. But Mr. Berry questioned whether Mr. Sudhalter had properly apportioned credit by giving too much of it to whites.
Writing in The Atlantic Monthy, William H. Youngren defended Mr. Sudhalter’s balance, saying the tendency at the time would be to see the book as an attack on black achievement. “Nothing could be further from Sudhalter’s intent,” he wrote. 
A month before the book was released, The Times published a long essay on the topic by Mr. Sudhalter in its Arts & Leisure section. A storm of letters followed.
In an interview with Contemporary Authors, Mr. Sudhalter said most critics had not grasped his point. “The angrier the denunciation, it seemed, the less the writer had actually read,” he said. His book, he said, was a history, not “a racial screed.”
Mr. Sudhalter, who was a music critic for The New York Post in the 1970s and ’80s, also wrote “Bix: Man and Legend” (Arlington House), a highly praised 1974 biography of Beiderbecke, with Philip R. Evans. His friend the critic Terry Teachout compared its thoroughness to “a scholarly biography of a major classical composer.”
In 2002 Mr. Sudhalter published “Stardust Melody: The Life and Music of Hoagy Carmichael” (Oxford). Jonathan Yardley of The Washington Post said the book showed “that Carmichael’s mind was deeper and tougher than first impressions might suggest.”
Richard Merrill Sudhalter was born in Boston on Dec. 28, 1938. His father was a saxophonist who adored jazz, particularly Beiderbecke, and took his son’s musical education seriously. By his teens the younger Sudhalter was playing his cornet in Boston clubs. He earned a degree in English literature and music from Oberlin, worked as a musician in Germany and then was a reporter for United Press International in Europe.
He gave more emphasis to playing after he visited the Williams College library to research his Beiderbecke book. He discovered all the arrangements of the Paul Whiteman Orchestra of the 1920s, in which Beiderbecke had played, and decided to form a band to play the arrangements.
So he returned to London, where he was then living, and gathered top British musicians to play as the New Paul Whiteman Orchestra. Fans applauded them wildly at a jazz festival, a recording was made four days later, and the group went on to successful appearances at Carnegie Hall and elsewhere. Mr. Sudhalter played the cornet in the role of Beiderbecke, with inflections reminiscent of his other idols, Louis Armstrong and Bobby Hackett.
In addition to Ms. Kellogg, Mr. Sudhalter is survived by his sister, Carol, of Queens; his brother, James, of Harrisburg, Pa.; and his daughters Adrian, of Manhattan, and Kimberly, of Hollywood, Calif.
Dan Morgenstern, director of the Institute of Jazz Studies at Rutgers University, said jazz lovers were disappointed years ago when the Classic Jazz Quartet suddenly broke up after the death of its pianist, Dick Wellstood. He recalled that all four members of the group were writers of various sorts, and all had a hearty sense of humor. 
Their first choice for a name, Mr. Morgenstern said, was the Bourgeois Scum, but “they were told that was not commercial.” 
THE BASICS
Only Donald Trump would have the nerve to open a hotel — at $400 a night and up — in a building still under construction. The upside, for Mr. Trump, is that he has money coming in. The downside, for guests, is that arriving at the hotel means navigating scaffolding and plywood barriers. Construction also brings extra noise (I heard drilling from my room, although not until 11 a.m.) and extra dirt on the floor-to-ceiling windows. Worse, some of the rooms with the desirable Chicago River and Lake Michigan views are unavailable because there are cranes blocking the east side of the building. Despite all of that, there are wonderful aspects to the Trump, especially if you’re into excess. One of the first things you’ll see in your room is a bottle of water that costs $25.
THE LOCATION
Trump’s building, which will top out at 92 stories, is on a bend in the Chicago River, amid several architectural landmarks, including Marina City and the classic Tribune Tower. But my view, from Room 2610, took in a slew of undistinguished condo towers and what appeared to be the world’s largest McDonald’s. 
THE ROOMS
The décor is somewhere between modern and traditional. There’s lots of shiny, dark wood, but none of the moldings or plush upholstery fabrics you’d see at, say, a Ritz-Carlton. Indeed, with every wall and ceiling painted the same putty gray, the room is a bit stark. Still, the bed was soft, if a little too cushy. And even the smallest room, like mine, contains a complete kitchen (which makes it feel as though you’re staying in an efficiency apartment). Another irritant: there were brochures and promotional guides everywhere, including a letter from Donald Trump inviting me to buy a condo in the building. There was even a greeting on the TV (which I spent 10 minutes trying to access, thinking it might be a real message). At these prices, I deserve to be left alone.
THE BATHROOM
A large room, covered in beige marble. The tub and shower are huddled behind glass, which reduces flexibility if there’s more than one person using the bathroom. Toiletries are (naturally) the Trump house brand.
AMENITIES
There’s a bar, called Rebar, on the second floor, with amazing river views. Drinks and nibbles (like a delicious lobster tempura roll) quickly reached $100 a person. The 16th-floor restaurant, called Sixteen, already has Chicago foodies buzzing. A scallop and foie gras appetizer, which I had at the bar, was $28, and worth it. Wi-Fi and the health club and pool (on the 14th floor) are included in the cost of the room.
ROOM SERVICE
Breakfast arrived promptly and was — dare I say it — perfect. (Even the toasted bagel was warm, a room service rarity.) True, at $50 delivered, it was hardly a bargain (for eggs, juice, herbal tea and the bagel). Unless you compare it with Ivanka Trump’s Caviar Breakfast, just a bit more than $800 for two with all the ancillary charges. 
BOTTOM LINE
A few rooms are available at $385, but most are considerably more. If you enjoy seeing the Trump name on everything, you’ll love staying here. Just remember to bring extra cash: you’ll feel cheap tipping a bellhop anything less than $20 for opening a door.

EDINBURGH — Donald Trump, the American real estate developer, won government approval Monday to build a golf and housing resort in northeastern Scotland, fending off opposition from environmentalists.
The Scottish finance and sustainable growth minister, John Swinney, said in a statement that there were "significant economic and social benefits" to the project, which is expected to cost £1 billion, or about $1.58 billion.
The resort, to be built on 1,400 acres, or 566 hectares, at the Menie Estate, in Balmedie, Aberdeenshire, will include two 18-hole courses, a 450-room hotel and 500 homes.
The approval is still subject to a detailed agreement between Trump and the Aberdeenshire Council.
Trump's proposal has been opposed by environmentalists because it encroaches on a nature reserve. Part of the golf course is to be built on a stretch of sand dunes that government environmental advisers say should be protected. Opponents have also said the land is not zoned for new housing.
The application was rejected by a municipal committee this year, but then the Scottish government stepped in. A three-week public inquiry was held in June and July in Aberdeen, where local businesses and politicians called the project vital to the area's economy.
Swinney said the finding by planning inspectors that the project would bring economic and social benefits was a major consideration in deciding to grant permission.
Trump said in a statement: "We are greatly honored by the positive decision and believe that the people of Scotland will be extremely happy with the final product. It will be a tremendous asset and source of pride for both Aberdeenshire and Scotland for many generations."
The dunes, in an area designated a site of special scientific interest, represent an unusual form of geomorphology. They move northward at an average of a few yards each year. Trump intends to plant a stretch of sand with marram grass to keep the dunes from moving onto the course.
"It appears that the desires of one high-profile overseas investor who refused to compromise one inch have been allowed to override the legal protection of this important site," said the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds, one of Britain's largest charities, with more than one million members. "We and thousands of other objectors consider this is too high a price to pay for the claimed economic benefits from this development."
The government's environmental advisers also opposed the development. The planning inspectors attached 40 proposed conditions, which the government has accepted. They include the provision of 98 affordable homes.
The Balmedie estate is in the constituency of Alex Salmond, Scotland's first minister, who delegated responsibility for the decision to Swinney.
Building the two golf courses was dependent on approval for the housing because the return on investment on them alone would not have been high enough, Trump told the inquiry in June.
Though British real estate prices have slumped in recent months, Trump told the inquiry that the golf courses, which will cost about £90 million, would go ahead even if economic conditions delayed the housing element.
Golf-related real estate is now worth more in Europe, the Middle East and Africa than the income generated from greens fees and golf club memberships, KPMG said in a report in September. Buyers are willing to pay a premium of as much as 30 percent to buy a property at a golf resort.
What attracts more local viewers  baseball playoff games or N.F.L. regular-season games?
Conventional thinking would suggest that a division series game starring one team in a market might get a higher rating than a Week 5 football game starring a second local team. But that supposition would be wrong. The N.F.L. is that potent.
On Sunday, just after 1 p.m., Game 4 of the Phillies-Brewers series in Milwaukee competed directly with the Packers’ kickoff against the Falcons at Green Bay. 
In the Milwaukee market, baseball’s 12.7 rating was less than half of football’s 28.7.
Back east in Philadelphia, the same Phillies-Brewers game was shown against the Redskins-Eagles broadcast. And the 13.2 local rating for the division series game fell considerably below the 22.7 for football.
In two other markets where baseball and football were shown hours apart Sunday, the results were the same. When the Tampa Bay Rays played the White Sox in Game 3 of their series in late afternoon, the Chicago market posted a 9.6 rating. But fans rewarded the Bears with a 21.9 rating for their earlier game against the Lions. 
 For Game 3 of Angels-Red Sox series, which started after 7 p.m. but lasted 5 hours 19 minutes, Boston-area viewers generated a 24.7 rating  six rating points below what the market produced for the late-afternoon broadcast of the Patriots-49ers game.
The results suggest that there are distinct followings for each sport, and even when rooting interests in the two sports intersected, football won. The football games have an additional edge because they are on broadcast networks, which are more widely available than the division series games on a broadly distributed cable network like TBS.
Lee Berke, an industry consultant, said the once-a-week frequency of N.F.L. games was a major and continuing advantage. 
“In a best-of-five playoff series, you can have five games,” he said. “So if you’re a fan of the Eagles and Phillies, you might say, the Eagles are only once a week, so I’ll watch the Eagles, then flip, or tune in later to the Phillies.”
In New York, fans motivated by Brett Favre’s move to the Jets are watching the team far more than last season, despite the Jets’ 2-2 record. 
Through four games and a bye week, the Jets’ 12.3 local rating is up 39 percent from a five-game average last year. The Jets opened with 12.6 and 15.5 ratings against Miami and New England, then dipped to a 10.1 against San Diego and a 10.8 against Arizona. Last year, the first four games rated between a 5.9 and an 8.4, but spiked to a 13.3 for the Week 5 loss to the Giants.
 “No doubt bringing Favre on board has had a pretty significant impact, but there’s a general energy about the team that we’re seeing in merchandising and sponsor activity,” said Matthew Higgins, the Jets’ executive vice president for business operations. He added that unique visitors to the Jets’ Web site were up 30 percent over 2007.
The Jets’ leap in local ratings is the biggest in the league, followed by a 24 percent hike for the Falcons and a 14 percent bump for the Dolphins. Coming off their Super Bowl victory, the Giants’ five-game average rating in the New York market is down 5 percent this year, but by this time last year, the Giants had played highly rated games with Dallas and Philadelphia; this year, they have played weak opponents like the Rams and the Bengals.
In other riveting news about what we watch, the league-championship-bound Rays had local ratings for their games on FSN Florida leap by 99 percent, the most in the majors. 
The Mets’ ratings on SNY slipped less than 1 percent, and the Yankees’ ratings on YES fell 10 percent over last year. The Mariners’ rating, once a major-league-high 14.9 in 2001 on FSN Northwest, sank to 4.2 this year.
FRATELLO’S YES TO YES Mike Fratello has signed with YES, joining Marv Albert on Nets games. They have been partners at TNT and NBC. 
Deep beneath the Earth’s surface from New York to West Virginia sits the Marcellus Shale, an enormous geological deposit of natural gas. Natural gas is one of the cleanest fuels available  if you can extract it without ruining the water around it.
 Retrieving Marcellus natural gas requires hydraulic fracturing with horizontal drilling, a process that shoots millions of gallons of water deep underground to break the rock and unlock the gas. Now that prospectors are using this process increasingly in Pennsylvania and hoping to begin soon in New York, there are two important questions: Where will all that water come from? And what happens to it when it is no longer needed?
 New York officials are exploring whether it’s possible to drill safely without poisoning water supplies. High on our list of concerns is whether the used water  some of it tainted with toxic chemicals  will later seep into streams, rivers and deep water wells, placing New York City’s municipal water supply at risk. Before the state allows exploration, there should be a clear agreement on how the used water will be dealt with safely.
Energy companies have already signed so many new leases for drilling rights with landowners in New York and Pennsylvania that one farmer called it a “modern-day gold rush.” Nobody wants to deprive these landowners of the money they can make, but the price of their good fortune cannot be the contamination of water supplies for everyone else.
Pete Grannis, the New York State environmental commissioner, promised at a recent hearing that, “we will not permit any drilling to take place that presents any threat to the city’s drinking-water supply.” That is an important commitment, but Mr. Grannis and Gov. David Paterson should take the safest course. While they search for ways to encourage drilling in less-sensitive areas, they should ban drilling anywhere near water supplies, and especially the city’s watershed.
State leaders in all of the areas touched by the Marcellus formation must find a balance between the need for energy and the need to protect water. 
Consumers need a voice in these tough times. And that voice is coming from Ivanka Trump.
Ms. Trump  daughter of Donald, owner of a diamond jewelry boutique, executive overseeing multimillion-dollar hotel developments and star of “Celebrity Apprentice 2”  has taken to blogging about saving money on lunch.
Last week, Ms. Trump began posting items at blog.ALunchTrade.com. She did not define what, exactly, a lunch trade was, saying only that on Oct. 21, she and a corporate partner would conduct one of them. But she did try to connect with the masses of office workers out there. 
“With gas and food prices on the rise, more and more people are skipping the deli line and bringing lunch to work to save money,” she wrote. “This is great, but all I hear is how boring a brown-bag lunch can get.”
The drudgery of office lunches, Ms. Trump wrote, was “something I completely relate to.”
Ms. Trump, as it turns out, was promoting a new line of microwave meals for ConAgra Foods. The meals are called Healthy Choice Fresh Mixers, available in varieties like Szechwan Beef and Southwestern Chicken, and they can be stored in a desk for up to a year with no refrigeration required.
The link between Ms. Trump and ConAgra was not immediately revealed, a ConAgra executive said, so that they could drum up interest in the promotion. (However, there were only 20 responses to her five blog posts last week.)
The lunch trade that Ms. Trump alluded to will happen on Tuesday, when ConAgra representatives will offer samples of the meals in two office buildings: the Grace Building on 42nd Street in New York, and 1 South Wacker Drive in Chicago. 
While it is difficult to imagine the former model lunching on processed chicken from a plastic tub, ConAgra executives said she was an ideal promoter.
“We wanted somebody who would appeal to a younger office worker who’s technology-savvy,” said Michael Locascio, vice president at ConAgra. “We wanted someone they could identify with, someone they knew, but also not somebody that was on the front of every tabloid.” 
Ms. Trump, possibly slicing baloney for her sandwich at home, was not available for comment. Asked whether Ms. Trump was the best choice to discuss budgeting, Mr. Locascio said that “we want to have her talk in a way that’s credible, which is why we’re talking about this as a business venture for her.”
“Because obviously, she has resources some don’t,” Mr. Locascio said.

A New Jersey appellate panel on Friday reversed a lower court’s decision in 2006 that would have forced the author of a book about the developer Donald J. Trump to reveal the unnamed sources of his information, The Associated Press reported. 
Mr. Trump sued Timothy L. O’Brien, the author of “TrumpNation: The Art of Being the Donald,” and the publisher, Warner Books (now a part of Hachette Book Group), claiming the book damaged his reputation. 
In his book, Mr. O’Brien, the editor of the Sunday Business section of The New York Times, wrote that Mr. Trump’s wealth measured between $150 million and $250 million, while Mr. Trump maintained that his fortune was in the billions.
The appellate judges ruled that details of Mr. Trump’s life were a matter of public interest and therefore subject to a state law protecting the sources and news-gathering methods of journalists. 
PARIS  No show in Europe at the moment bids to be more spectacular, or ends up being more exasperating, than “Picasso and the Masters,” sprawling here through the Grand Palais. If there’s good news to the financial meltdown, it’s that maybe bloated blockbusters like this one should become harder to organize.
Not that anyone in Paris seems discontented with the exhibition. From morning to night, long lines inch through the front doors to pay obeisance to this endlessly popular Spaniard, who was ahead of his time not least in churning out so many works to satisfy what has become the cultural industrial complex of the early 21st century. 
Next door, a fine show of Emil Nolde hardly attracts a soul, sadly. FIAC, the art fair that shared quarters in the Grand Palais these last several days, was populated by shell-shocked dealers murmuring worriedly amongst themselves about the bygone customers whom not so long ago they had blithely turned away or gave five minutes to decide whether to buy a picture. 
Picasso, in such straitened times, remains at least a reliable brand for exhibition organizers, who especially seem to love these compare-and-contrast affairs because they guarantee boffo box office. Just a couple of years ago, Madrid had a pair of such shows, the Guggenheim in New York yet another. 
The Grand Palais, never mind the accompanying displays at Orsay (Picasso and Manet) and the Louvre (Picasso and Delacroix), trumps those events, gathering together hundreds of Picassos along with far-flung trophies that inspired or ostensibly inspired him: pictures by Cranach and Titian, Poussin and Ribera, Chardin and Zurbarán, El Greco and Courbet, Degas and le Douanier Rousseau. The list goes on. 
I lingered in the last room, watching visitors stumble a bit bleary-eyed from the earlier galleries to find Manet’s “Olympia,” Rembrandt’s painting of Hendrickje Stoffels bathing in a brook, Ingres’s grisaille “Odalisque” and Goya’s “Naked Maja” vying with a slew of late, mostly slapdash nudes by the great matador of Modernism. The whole ensemble of pictures was dazzling and fatuous. “Overkill” doesn’t adequately describe the effect.
Let it first be said that Picasso, having taken on history as if fated to do so from childhood, embraced such extravagant comparisons  which isn’t to say he survives the competition altogether intact. “Art is not the application of a canon of beauty,” he once said, “but what instinct and the brain imagine quite apart from the canon.” 
The canon, in other words, remained his starting point but increasingly became his crutch. His achievements were Promethean and unparalleled in the last century, but having said that, as the show proves almost despite itself, Picasso ended up often mired in vain, backward-looking riffs on grander achievements. 
Perhaps it’s as the photographer Henri Cartier-Bresson once put it, talking about Picasso’s failure to appreciate Bonnard. “Picasso had no heart,” he said. That’s pretty harsh. 
On the other hand, there are his copies of Velazquez’s “Méninas.” From the 1950s, they tinker with variations on his familiar devices  the fractured, faux-childish faces; the swift, sketchy brushwork; the primary colors set often against black; the clattery scaffolding of faceted planes and accordion space  to produce what looks clever but finally cartoonish when considered against the grave dignity and humanity of the original. Granted, comparing anything with “Las Méninas” is unfair, but then, Picasso invited the comparison, and from it one gets Cartier-Bresson’s point.
Even that remark about the canon, as it happens, recalls what a century before one of Picasso’s canonical heroes, Delacroix, wrote: That great art derives both from humility before the past and a conviction that “what has already been said is not enough.” 
Picasso’s later career, you might say, was a one-man wrestling match with the limits of his own enormous genius in relation to history, and his failures were, humanly speaking, as compelling as his accomplishments, but that interpretation requires from an exhibition not blind hero worship but, as Delacroix had it, a little humility. The show here lacks this altogether, substituting swagger for judgment, bluster for nuance, and in art, as in politics and finance, we’ve had enough of that approach already. 
It is as if the traveling of priceless art from far-flung places and the clout that made it happen were enough  that we are supposed to feel grateful for what’s over-the-top about “Picasso and the Masters”  whereas the show’s excess is exactly what gets in the way of our standing peaceably and intimately before a picture. 
The best blockbusters make you forget their blockbuster-ness. The Louvre happens to have an Andrea Mantegna show that’s big and marvelous and includes other artists on whom Mantegna depended or whom he influenced, some of them mediocre, some great. Crowds look closely and slowly. The show promotes that. The art rewards it.
At one point at the Grand Palais, I braved the throng and plunged as if into a strong headwind, anchoring myself before a late Picasso portrait. Against a bright orange and red backdrop, a bearded figure with large, hooded, almond eyes and what looks like a long blond wig, returned my gaze. He’s the picture of a proud, weary man with a slight identity crisis. The work appears to have been done in a flash. The date was July 31, 1971. It’s catchy, electric.
But something was missing. It will become clear, I thought, with a little more time, before a tsunami of fellow visitors swept clean the gallery. 
We tend to judge exhibitions as we do one another, according to their regard for individuals. We’re awed by flash and fame. But we’re really looking to make some deeper connection, even just one, beyond the bluster and hype, that feels lasting and true. 
It was those almond eyes, I realized later on the street outside, thinking back on that portrait. They were hollow.
The statistics from the World Mind Sports Games in Beijing are interesting. There were five brain games being played: bridge, checkers (draughts), chess, go and Chinese chess (xiangqi). The games had 2,763 competitors, who came from 143 countries and regions. Bridge, with 1,452 players, accounted for more than half that number, and many of the world’s top experts took part. This tournament replaced and expanded upon the quadrennial World Team Olympiad, which began in 1960.
 More than 700 junior players participated. They received most of their expenses, primarily from Air China and the Russian Soda Company.
 China won far more medals than any other country because it monopolized chess, go and xiangqi. China captured 12 gold, 8 silver and 6 bronze. Second was Russia with 4 gold, 1 silver and 3 bronze. Norway did best in bridge, winning 2 gold, 1 silver and 3 bronze.
 In the diagramed deal, Shane Blanchard of the United States under-26 team saved points against Denmark by playing carefully to make five diamonds.
 At the other table, the Danish pair of Emil Jepsen (North) and Dennis Bilde reached the much easier contract of three no-trump, which had nine top tricks: two spades, six diamonds and one club. A club lead from West gave away a 10th trick, and a subsequent misdefense furnished an 11th.
 In this auction, South should have bid three no-trump over three spades to show his club stoppers. That would probably have ended the bidding, but North might have continued with four diamonds. Notice that if South’s club queen were the spade queen, six diamonds would be almost laydown.
 Against five diamonds, Anne-Sofie Houlberg (West) led the spade jack. Blanchard won with dummy’s ace, played a club to his ace, ruffed a club in the dummy and called for a low heart. Lars Kirkegaard Nielsen (East) went in with his jack and shifted to a trump, exposing the 4-0 break.
 After winning with dummy’s jack, declarer ruffed a heart in his hand, trumped the club queen on the board, ruffed another heart in his hand, cashed his spade king and led his last spade to West’s ten. Everyone had three cards left. South held the A-K-9 of diamonds over East’s 10-5-3, and so took the remaining tricks with a trump coup.
 Minus 460 and plus 400 cost the United States 2 international match points. But it would have been an 11-imp loss if Blanchard had failed in five diamonds.

LONDON — The Scottish government said on Monday that it would grant planning permission for the U.S. tycoon Donald Trump to build a controversial $2 billion golfing development on a pristine stretch of northeast coast.
The permission is subject to Trump and the council satisfactorily concluding legal agreements with each other.
"This is essentially approval for the project," said a Scottish government spokesman.
Last November, an Aberdeenshire council committee rejected on environmental grounds the project to build two championship golf courses, 500 homes, four blocks of holiday flats, a luxury hotel and 36 villas.
But the council later reversed that decision shortly after the Scottish government said it was intervening because the development was too important to be dealt with by local legislators.
Trump, a real estate magnate, had threatened to relocate the project to Northern Ireland.
The Scottish finance secretary John Swinney said he agreed with the conclusions of the government's own planning inquiry, which "found there was significant economic and social benefit to be gained from this project."
Environmentalists had feared extensive construction on the sensitive site would damage wildlife and local habitats.
About a third of the land that Trump wants to build on is classified as an area of "special scientific interest".
 Guess who is complaining that condominiums in Donald Trump’s latest big project are ridiculously overpriced.
 Donald Trump is.
 But he isn’t cutting the prices. He says the banks won’t let him.
 The project is the Trump International Hotel and Tower in Chicago, which is to be the second-tallest building in that city (after the Sears Tower). By Mr. Trump’s account, sales were going great until “the real estate market in Chicago suffered a severe downturn” and the bankers made it worse by “creating the current financial crisis.”
 Those assertions are made in a fascinating lawsuit filed by Mr. Trump, the real estate developer, television personality and best-selling author, in an effort to avoid paying $40 million that he personally guaranteed on a construction loan that Deutsche Bank says is due and payable. 
 Rather than have to pay the $40 million, Mr. Trump thinks the bank should pay him $3 billion for undermining the project and damaging his reputation.
He points to a “force majeure” clause in the lending agreement that allows the borrower to delay completion of the building if construction is hampered by such things as riots, floods or strikes. That clause has a catch-all section covering “any other event or circumstance not within the reasonable control of the borrower,” and Mr. Trump figures that lets him out, even though construction is continuing.
“Would you consider the biggest depression we have had in this country since 1929 to be such an event? I would,” he said in an interview. “A depression is not within the control of the borrower.”
He wants a state judge in the Queens borough of New York to order the bank to delay efforts to collect the loan until “a reasonable time” after the financial crisis ends.
 Deutsche Bank thinks the idea that an economic downturn should free people from the obligation to pay their debts is laughable.
Mr. Trump, it may be noted, does not think remorseful condominium buyers are in a similar position. When I asked him if he would let them walk away from contracts to buy apartments at predepression prices, he said he would not. “They don’t have a force majeure clause,” he said.
The suit, and a parallel one by Deutsche Bank seeking the money, provide a glimpse into both how Mr. Trump does business and into the way the real estate loan market was operating in 2005, when the loan was made.
For this big project, built on the site of the old Chicago Sun-Times building, it appears from the court papers that Mr. Trump put in little of his own money. He got a construction loan for up to $640 million from a syndicate headed by Deutsche Bank and a $130 million junior loan from another syndicate headed by Fortress Investments, a hedge fund operator that has troubles stemming in part from bad loans made for other real estate projects.
The people who negotiated the construction loan did not think real estate prices could tumble. The loan agreement requires partial repayment each time an apartment is sold and provides a detailed list of the minimum prices to be charged.
According to Mr. Trump’s suit, he cannot cut prices without the unanimous consent of the lenders, and that has not been forthcoming. There are a lot of lenders in the deal, and some of them appear to be banks and hedge funds that are no longer in good shape.
The loan was due Nov. 7, and the lenders did not grant a requested extension. Mr. Trump filed his lawsuit just before that deadline.
Mr. Trump sees a dark conspiracy. He says Deutsche Bank, through a subsidiary, owns $30 million of the junior loan, and he says that is a blatant conflict of interest because in some cases the interests of the two loans can differ. To Mr. Trump, the bank’s actions suggest it is trying to seize the building just before its great success is assured. 
The bank responds that the loan agreement makes clear that it has a right to do everything it has done, and that Mr. Trump should live up to his obligations, paying $40 million of the $334 million outstanding balance on the construction loan. The rest is owed by the Trump-controlled company sponsoring the project but is not personally guaranteed by him. 
If Mr. Trump was forced to pay the $40 million, he would be unlikely to permanently lose it, since his company would owe it to him. If the project went under, his claim would rank higher than the Fortress loan. Deutsche will make nothing from its investment in the junior loan if Mr. Trump does lose any money.
Some sort of settlement seems wise. It is in everyone’s interest that construction be completed, and in fact the bank advanced $13 million to pay contractors’ bills this week.
Mr. Trump has not said by how much he thinks the apartments are overpriced, and he did not tell me. But it seems unlikely that sales will be very good until prices are cut.
In his suit, Mr. Trump claims that the bank’s “predatory lending practices” are harming his reputation, “which is associated worldwide with on-time, under-budget, first-class construction projects and first-class luxury hotel operations.”
The bank seized on the opportunity to discuss Mr. Trump’s reputation. “Trump is no stranger to overdue debt,” it said in asking that his suit be thrown out of court. It noted that Mr. Trump’s casino operations have filed for bankruptcy twice, adding, “This suit is classic Trump.”
The bank did not discuss why that history did not dissuade it from making the loan. One explanation might be that the fees it got for arranging the loan more than offset the risk from the small part of the loan it kept on its own books.
Mr. Trump is vigilant in protecting his reputation. After I interviewed him and two associates, his general counsel sent me a note saying “it was a pleasure” talking to me, and adding: “Please be assured that if your article is not factually correct, we will have no choice but to sue you and The New York Times.”
The Friday after Thanksgiving was not a really good one for Mr. Trump. Trump Entertainment Resorts, the casino company, announced it would miss an interest payment on its bonds, raising the likelihood of a third bankruptcy. Most of the shares are publicly owned, having been distributed to creditors in the last bankruptcy. They have fallen from a peak of $23.80 two years ago to 24 cents on Thursday.
Mr. Trump is doing his best to sound like that is not important to him. The casino company’s announcement emphasized that Mr. Trump was the “nonexecutive chairman” who was “not involved in the daily operations” of the company. He told me that “less than 1 percent of my net worth” is in the casino company.
At the current price, no shareholder could have a large net worth in that stock.
On the same day, in New York, Deutsche Bank asked a judge to issue a summary judgment requiring Mr. Trump to pay the $40 million.
In that filing, the bank quoted from a best-selling book Mr. Trump wrote last year, “Think Big and Kick Ass in Business and Life.” In it, the developer said he loved “to crush the other side and take the benefits” and mocked the banks that had lost money on loans made to him before another real estate downturn, in the 1990s:
“I figured it was the bank’s problem, not mine. What the hell did I care? I actually told one bank, ‘I told you you shouldn’t have loaned me that money. I told you the goddamn deal was no good.’ ”
If Mr. Trump manages to persuade a judge that the current crisis provides him with a good reason not to meet his obligations, he will have some great tales to tell in his next book.
The Israeli trumpeter Avishai Cohen places great faith in flow, as both a rhythmic feeling and a metaphysical ideal. His new trio record, “Flood” (Anzic), is the second installment of his “Big Rain Trilogy,” which he conceived as an artistic response to catastrophic events. The album’s folklike, minor-key melodies propose a meditative perspective, and so does Mr. Cohen himself, in a statement printed on the inside jacket. “Nature does not lament the flood nor resist it,” he writes, “but rather accepts it on its own.”
Throughout his second set on Wednesday night at the Jazz Standard, Mr. Cohen exposed both the wisdom and the shortcomings of that philosophy. Leading a band he calls Triveni, after a Sanskrit word describing a convergence of three rivers, he improvised with a steady exhalation of phrases but also a vital undertow of tension. On the whole it was much more turbulent than the music on “Flood,” and a good deal more gripping. 
Triveni usually consists of Mr. Cohen, the bassist Omer Avital and the drummer Nasheet Waits. Here the bassist Ben Street was filling in on short notice, and the substitution worked seamlessly. Right out of the gate  with the opener, “Safety Land”  the group established a casual urgency, swinging fast and loose. 
Mr. Cohen is an extravagantly skilled trumpeter, equally at ease zipping around the stratosphere or ruminating in his dark middle range. He has the stamina and creative resolve to carry a pianoless trio of this sort, and here he made the most of his space. 
His solo on a brooding theme called “Ferrara Napoli” was relaxed and soulful, at one point suggesting vintage Clark Terry. Then, finessing the Charles Mingus ballad “Portrait,” he deftly combined sensitivity and flair. (Mingus means a lot to him; he also quoted a scrap of “Haitian Fight Song” during his solo on another tune.)
Late in the set Mr. Cohen invited his sister, the clarinetist Anat Cohen, to join the group for a brand-new composition called “November 30th.” Featuring open-ended harmonies and an even-keeled groove, it was the only piece in the set that emanated a spirit of stillness. It also felt only half finished, as if awaiting further instructions.
That wasn’t an issue with the following tune, “Vote for Barack.” (When he performed it on the WNYC show “Soundcheck” on Election Day, Mr. Cohen puckishly claimed it was for his friend Barak Mori, a bassist.) Its mischievous tone and slippery form evoked the frontier of free jazz, and the musicians tackled it gleefully. Sticking to the realm of watery metaphor, they were shooting rapids: riding the current even as they resisted it.
To the Editor:
Re “Billy’s Gotta Dance. Does He Gotta Fly?” by Charles Isherwood [Dec. 14]:
As a choreographer and avid theatergoer I agree with Mr. Isherwood on the unnecessary detour Billy Elliot takes to Neverland via a clunky metal clasp.
Because I admired earlier scenes in the play for their originality, the opportunity squandered in the duet between Billy and his older self came as even more of a shock. Perhaps more important: I waited in vain for Billy to fulfill his teacher’s command to express his feelings instead of merely displaying his technical skills as a dancer. 
The superb Kiril Kulish, playing Billy the night I saw the show, was clearly capable of investing movement with emotional power, but the director must have decided that virtuosity is more important. The choice puzzled me until I read Mr. Isherwood’s view, that “the musical is infected by the supersized ethos that followed in the wake of megahits like ‘Cats’ and ‘Les Miserables.’ ”

 Not a creature stirred.
 I wonder if West will ever bid, South mused restlessly.
 West: Should I bid one heart or two no-trump? Who will benefit more if I show both of my suits immediately? Given the vulnerability, I think I will stay low. “One heart.”
 North: Do I show my spades, or do I jump to three clubs, which we play as a game-invitational limit raise? Those spades are so weak. “Three clubs.”
 East: That’s annoying. I would have liked to bid two hearts, but with 4-3-3-3 distribution, three hearts is too rich for me. “Pass.”
 South: We must have a chance at game. But partner won’t have four spades, because he didn’t make a negative double. “Three diamonds.”
 West: Three diamonds? That’s a surprise. And North paused awhile. Perhaps he was thinking of bidding no-trump. Maybe I did well not to overcall two no-trump. For the moment, though  “Double.”
 North: I’ll show my heart card and see what partner wants to do. “Three hearts.”
 East: That’s lucky; now I can tell partner about my heart values. “Double.”
 South: This is working out well for me. Partner will know I am short in hearts after I bid  “Three spades.”
 West: No problem. “Four hearts.”
 North: Why should I be ashamed of my hand? I’d like to bid four spades, but partner would think I was showing a control in the suit, not length. “Five clubs.”
 East: There seem to be 50 points in this deck. Do we all have the same colored cards? Yes, we do. Well, enough of this nonsense. “Double.”
 South: “Pass. Content.”
 West: “Pass. I hope he knows what he is doing.”
 North: “Pass. Hmm.”
 West: What to lead? A spade? If partner has the ace and can give me a ruff, that would be great. But it is one of South’s suits. And it sounds as if South will be taking tricks by ruffing. I am going to lead a trump.
 South: Oh no! Partner has four spades. That was our spot. I must not fret about that now, though. My 11 tricks will have to be five clubs, one heart, three spades and two heart ruffs in my hand. To open lines of communication I must cash the heart ace, then give up a diamond.
 East took this trick and played another trump, which ran to dummy’s six.
 Declarer ruffed two hearts in his hand and two diamonds on the board to give this end-position: (See Diagram 2)
 Cashing the club ace, then running the spade nine would have worked, but South realized that he would lose the rest of the tricks for down three if East had a red card left or if West had a singleton spade jack. Instead declarer immediately ran the spade nine.
 East took the next spade trick and returned a spade. South cashed his winners in that suit and won the 13th trick with dummy’s club ace, East having to underruff with his jack.
 Did you ever see the trump ace take the final trick? And with a defender underruffing?
 Perhaps you think this deal was composed for the holiday season. Ye of little faith. It occurred more than 40 years ago in Geneva during a challenge match between Britain and Switzerland. South was the Swiss expert Jean Besse, who arrived late for the session, complaining of a migraine.
 In the other room North-South found the spade fit and settled in four spades, which could have been made. But West went on to five hearts, which was doubled and went down two. So Switzerland was plus 550 and minus 500, gaining 2 international match points.
Freddie Hubbard, a jazz trumpeter who dazzled audiences and critics alike with his virtuosity, his melodicism and his infectious energy, died on Monday in Sherman Oaks, Calif. He was 70 and lived in Sherman Oaks. 
The cause was complications of a heart attack he had on Nov. 26, said his spokesman, Don Lucoff of DL Media. 
Over a career that began in the late 1950s, Mr. Hubbard earned both critical praise and commercial success  although rarely for the same projects. 
He attracted attention in the 1960s for his bravura work as a member of the Jazz Messengers, the valuable training ground for young musicians led by the veteran drummer Art Blakey, and on albums by Herbie Hancock, Wayne Shorter and many others. He also recorded several well-regarded albums as a leader. And although he was not an avant-gardist by temperament, he participated in three of the seminal recordings of the 1960s jazz avant-garde: Ornette Coleman’s “Free Jazz” (1960), Eric Dolphy’s “Out to Lunch” (1964) and John Coltrane’s “Ascension” (1965).
In the 1970s Mr. Hubbard, like many other jazz musicians of his generation, began courting a larger audience, with albums that featured electric instruments, rock and funk rhythms, string arrangements and repertory sprinkled with pop and R&B songs like Paul McCartney’s “Uncle Albert/Admiral Halsey” and the Stylistics’ “Betcha by Golly, Wow.” His audience did indeed grow, but his standing in the jazz world diminished.
By the start of the next decade he had largely abandoned his more commercial approach and returned to his jazz roots. But his career came to a virtual halt in 1992 when he damaged his lip, and although he resumed performing and recording after an extended hiatus, he was never again as powerful a player as he had been in his prime. 
Frederick Dewayne Hubbard was born on April 7, 1938, in Indianapolis. His first instrument was the alto-brass mellophone, and in high school he studied French horn and tuba as well as trumpet. After taking lessons with Max Woodbury, the first trumpeter of the Indianapolis Symphony Orchestra, at the Arthur Jordan Conservatory of Music, he performed locally with, among others, the guitarist Wes Montgomery and his brothers.
Mr. Hubbard moved to New York in 1958 and almost immediately began working with groups led by the saxophonist Sonny Rollins, the drummer Philly Joe Jones and others. His profile rose in 1960 when he joined the roster of Blue Note, a leading jazz label; it rose further the next year when he was hired by Blakey, widely regarded as the music’s premier talent scout.
Adding his own spin to a style informed by Dizzy Gillespie, Miles Davis and Clifford Brown, Mr. Hubbard played trumpet with an unusual mix of melodic inventiveness and technical razzle-dazzle. The critics took notice. Leonard Feather called him “one of the most skilled, original and forceful trumpeters of the ’60s.” 
After leaving Blakey’s band in 1964, Mr. Hubbard worked for a while with another drummer-bandleader, Max Roach, before forming his own group in 1966. Four years later he began recording for CTI, a record company that would soon become known for its aggressive efforts to market jazz musicians beyond the confines of the jazz audience.
His first albums for the label, notably “Red Clay,” contained some of the best playing of his career and, except for slicker production and the presence of some electric instruments, were not significantly different from his work for Blue Note. But his later albums on CTI, and the ones he made after leaving the label for Columbia in 1974, put less and less emphasis on improvisation and relied more and more on glossy arrangements and pop appeal. They sold well, for the most part, but were attacked, or in some cases simply ignored, by jazz critics. Within a few years Mr. Hubbard was expressing regrets about his career path.
Most of his recordings as a leader from the early 1980s on, for Pablo, Musicmasters and other labels, were small-group sessions emphasizing his gifts as an improviser that helped restore his critical reputation. But in 1992 he suffered a setback from which he never fully recovered.
By Mr. Hubbard’s own account, he seriously injured his upper lip that year by playing too hard, without warming up, once too often. The lip became infected, and for the rest of his life it was a struggle for him to play with his trademark strength and fire. As Howard Mandel explained in a 2008 Down Beat article, “His ability to project and hold a clear tone was damaged, so his fast finger flurries often result in blurts and blurs rather than explosive phrases.” 
Mr. Hubbard nonetheless continued to perform and record sporadically, primarily on fluegelhorn rather than on the more demanding trumpet. In his last years he worked mostly with the trumpeter David Weiss, who featured Mr. Hubbard as a guest artist with his group, the New Jazz Composers Octet, on albums released under Mr. Hubbard’s name in 2001 and 2008, and at occasional nightclub engagements.
Mr. Hubbard won a Grammy Award for the album “First Light” in 1972 and was named a National Endowment for the Arts Jazz Master in 2006.
He is survived by his wife of 35 years, Briggie Hubbard, and his son, Duane. 
Mr. Hubbard was once known as the brashest of jazzmen, but his personality as well as his music mellowed in the wake of his lip problems. In a 1995 interview with Fred Shuster of Down Beat, he offered some sober advice to younger musicians: “Don’t make the mistake I made of not taking care of myself. Please, keep your chops cool and don’t overblow.” 
 Trump Entertainment Resorts, the casino operator, said on Wednesday it won more time from its lenders to negotiate or make interest payments on its debt. The company has obtained a forbearance agreement from the holders of about 70 percent of the value of 8.5 percent senior secured notes due 2015, on which the company missed interest payments in December. It also announced a forbearance agreement from lenders under the company’s $490 million senior secured term loan. Holders have agreed to abstain from exercising their rights until Jan. 21, Trump Entertainment said in a regulatory filing. The company remains in discussions with lenders and certain note holders about a possible restructuring of its capital, it said. On Dec. 1, the company missed a $53.1 million bond interest payment, citing an effort to “maintain sufficient liquidity.” 
The winners of the Truscott Board-a-Match Teams at the Edgar Kaplan Winter Regional, played in Manhattan last month, were Janice Seamon-Molson of Hollywood, Fla.; Debbie and Michael Rosenberg of New Rochelle, N.Y.; and R. Jay Becker of New York. They sent in a deal with interesting play at both tables. So we are going to experiment, splitting it across two columns, today and Saturday.
 In the first room, with Seamon-Molson sitting North and Debbie Rosenberg South, the auction went as given. North underbid slightly at her second turn. If she had had the doubleton ace of diamonds and a low club, she would have made a four-club splinter bid, showing four-card spade support, the values for game and a singleton or void in clubs.
 South control-bid (cue-bid) four clubs to promise a control in that suit. North showed her heart control. South signed off, having made her slam-try, but North had enough to bid again, and six spades was reached.
 What should West have led?
 Although nothing definitely defeats the contract, West led the diamond jack, hoping his partner had the queen. This gave South several winning options. Declarer won with her queen and played a trump. When West discarded a club, South could have won with dummy’s ace and played on crossruff lines. But she inserted the spade jack, losing to East’s king.
 If East had returned a trump (best), declarer would have got home by finessing in hearts. East, though, shifted to a club to dummy’s ace.
 The play proceeded: diamond to South’s ace, club king, diamond ruff, heart ace, heart ruff, club ruff, heart ruff to give this position: (see diagram 2)
 Declarer ruffed her diamond with dummy’s spade ace, East having to underruff. Then a heart lead caught East’s spades in a trump coup for plus 980.

WASHINGTON  As the ranking Democrat and then chairman of the House Budget Committee, Representative John M. Spratt Jr. of South Carolina accused President Bush for eight years of recklessly running up huge fiscal deficits.
But by noon on Wednesday, after listening for two hours as economists explained why it was crucial to run a large deficit  one that would triple the previous record and vault far above $1 trillion  Mr. Spratt looked shell-shocked. 
Lingering in his chair as the cavernous hearing room emptied, he stared into the distance and gave vent to his concerns.
“The thing I wanted to ask,” he said, “was if there was some limit which we should be wary of? Is there some limit in terms of how much borrowing and debt creation we should take on?”
For the moment, the answer is no. The Congressional Budget Office predicted on Wednesday that the federal deficit would balloon to $1.2 trillion this year  even before Democrats pass an economic stimulus bill that could cost an additional $1 trillion spread over this year and next.
To a degree that would have been unimaginable two years ago, economists and politicians from across the political spectrum have put aside calls for fiscal restraint and decided that Congress should spend whatever it takes to rescue the economy. 
A startling range of name-brand economists  Martin Feldstein of Harvard and a top adviser to Republican presidents; Mark Zandi of Moody’s Economy.com and a former adviser to Senator John McCain’s presidential campaign; and Robert B. Reich, secretary of labor under President Clinton  urged Democratic lawmakers on Wednesday to think more boldly than ever before.
“It pains me to say that because I am a fiscal conservative who dislikes budget deficits and increases in government spending,” Mr. Feldstein told the lawmakers. But he said, “Reviving the economy requires major fiscal stimulus from tax cuts and increased government spending.”
Economists and politicians alike admit they are in uncharted territory. They are looking at an economic downturn far worse than any in the past half-century  and nobody knows how deep it will prove to be. “We have never been here before,” Mr. Reich said. “If anybody tells you they know exactly what to do, don’t believe them.”
Despite the consensus on the need for a mega-stimulus package, the sheer size of the projected budget gap is likely to revive age-old tensions between short-term goals like an economic recovery and long-term goals like reining in the soaring cost of the entitlement programs Social Security and Medicare. 
“This is one of the worst budget forecasts I have seen in my lifetime,” said Senator Kent Conrad, Democrat of North Dakota and chairman of the Senate Budget Committee. 
But Mr. Conrad said the forecast merely highlighted the urgency of enacting a stimulus program to prevent the recession from getting worse.
“We must act quickly to pass an economic recovery package that will create jobs and jump-start economic growth,” he said. “While it is understandable that this package will worsen our near-term budget picture, we should not enact provisions that will exacerbate our long-term deficits and debt.”
The good news is that, for the moment, there is plenty of cheap money available for the Treasury to borrow because investors around the world view Treasury bills and bonds as a haven from the turmoil in financial markets.
But over time, especially as global confidence revives and demand for credit climbs, the government’s huge appetite for borrowing could drive up interest rates. The situation could worsen if countries like China, which has soaked up vast amounts of American debt, become more reluctant to do so in the future.
Those worries are likely to embolden budget hawks  like the Blue Dog Democrats who make up a large bloc of votes within the House Democratic caucus  to push aggressively for tough new versions of the pay-as-you-go rules that imposed tight constraints on spending in the 1990s.
President-elect Barack Obama has said he wants to reform the budget process and tighten discipline, but a revival or even expansion of prior budget rules could constrain his ability to finance his other goals. Those include expanding health care coverage, investing in “clean” energy and ramping up spending on education. 
On Wednesday, Mr. Obama hinted at what could be another, more formidable path toward fiscal discipline: overhauling Social Security and Medicare, which are the fastest-growing parts of the federal budget and the biggest long-run threat to fiscal stability.
Asked at a news conference if he intended to tackle those programs, Mr. Obama said that “entitlements will be a part, a central part,” of his budget discussions and predicted that he would have more to say on the subject by February.
The budget office said the $1.2 trillion deficit would equal 8.3 percent of gross domestic product, obliterating the previous postwar record of 6 percent, reached in 1983 under President Ronald Reagan.
If Democrats enact a stimulus program of $1 trillion over two years, which is possible, the deficit this year could widen to about $1.7 trillion or more than 10 percent of gross domestic product.
The budget office said its grim budget projection stemmed from the severe plunge of the economy, which it predicted would contract 2.2 percent in 2009 and register anemic growth in 2010. The agency predicted that unemployment would climb to more than 9 percent by the end of 2009, up from 6.7 percent in November.
The economy had already lost 1.9 million jobs in 2008 through November, and that total is certain to jump to well above 2 million on Friday, when the Labor Department reports employment numbers for December. 
The recession, which officially began in December 2007, has pummeled the federal budget by both reducing tax revenue and increasing costs for unemployment benefits, food stamps and the growing number of corporate bailouts.
The budget office estimated that tax revenue would sink by $166 billion this year, a 6.6 percent decline. 
But one reason that the deficit estimate was higher than those of outside analysts was that it added in hundreds of billions of dollars in spending tied to the government’s existing bailout programs, which the Bush administration has thus far treated as “investments” it would recoup rather than “spending” or “costs” that are down the drain.
For example, the budget office estimated that the present-value cost of the Treasury Department’s $700 billion bailout program for financial institutions  known as the Troubled Asset Relief Program  would be $180 billion in 2009. The agency said that estimate was based on its judgment of the program’s risks and probable losses over time.
In addition, the budget office said it included all the money used in propping up Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the government-sponsored mortgage finance companies that the Treasury seized in September and put into a conservatorship. Those costs would add $240 billion to the deficit in 2009. 
NBC’s broadcast of the Golden Globes ceremony attracted 14.6 million viewers during prime time on Sunday, according to Nielsen’s estimates, lifting the network to second place in the night’s ratings. Although the broadcast was down more than 5 million viewers from two years ago (20 million), it was up considerably over last year’s show (6.2 million), when a news conference substituted for the regular awards ceremony because of the writers’ strike. CBS led Sunday’s ratings, averaging nearly 30 million viewers during the 7 p.m. hour with postseason football coverage. CBS’s “60 Minutes” followed at 8 (15.7 million), but the network gradually lost viewers as the night went on with “Cold Case” at 9 (12.4 million) and “The Unit” at 10 (10.4 million). ABC finished third, attracting 13.8 million viewers at 9 for “Desperate Housewives,” well below average for the series. At 8 ABC drew 10.3 million for “Extreme Makeover: Home Edition,” and at 10 “Brothers & Sisters” garnered 9.1 million. Fox ranked fourth over all as the two-hour seventh-season premiere of “24” delivered 12.5 million viewers from 8 to 10, well short of the 15.8 million who tuned in to the show’s last season debut, in 2007.
THE West Branch and BarBao opened only about a week and half a dozen blocks apart in late October.
Over the next months I never ate dinner at the West Branch when it wasn’t packed.
BarBao, on the other hand, had more empty seats than full ones.
A fluke of the nights I went? Maybe. But I get the strong sense that one of these Upper West Side newcomers is faring appreciably better than the other. And I think the discrepancy may say a lot about which types of restaurants this cruel economy is going to be kinder to, which are in for a less merciful and less certain run, and the fact that quality isn’t necessarily the chief determinant.
Both the West Branch, a mostly Mediterranean brasserie, and BarBao, which interprets Vietnamese cuisine, deserve to make it. While their kitchens aren’t consistent enough or their menus quite original enough to brand them destination restaurants, they have real talent in their DNA and bring serious food to a patch of Manhattan that, for all its recent strides, could still use more of it. At a different moment, in a different climate, both could probably count on success.
But in this one, merit and good intentions aren’t enough. Caution, classics and French fries  these may matter more. Our next president himself, Barack Obama, perhaps said it best, though back in 2001, when taping a restaurant-related television show in Chicago.
 “I’m not looking for some fancy presentations or extraordinarily subtle flavors,” Mr. Obama said, defining his epicurean bent. “What I’m looking for is food that tastes good for a good price.”
That’s a sensibility perhaps better fed by the West Branch than by BarBao, even though BarBao’s cooking is more exciting and slightly more memorable.
An offshoot of the beloved Upper West Side restaurant Ouest, the West Branch has a ready-made clientele in all the grateful diners who consider the chef Tom Valenti, who runs both establishments, a hero for improving their ZIP code’s culinary lot.
It maintains Mr. Valenti’s Franco-Italo inclinations and meaty preoccupations while adjusting to a miserable economy by having lower prices than Ouest’s. About half the entrees are less than $20.
It also has a looser spirit, symbolized by a large TV playing sports events over the front bar. Beyond the bar are a series of rooms that look instantly weathered and utterly familiar, the dark woods, dark booths and distressed mirrors straight out of the pub-cum-brasserie playbook. 
Approachability is the guiding ethos, manifest as well in raw bar selections, crowd-pleasing salads (Caesar, frisée aux lardons, beets with goat cheese), starchy sides (including, of course, fries) and an overall collection of dishes with an emphasis on comfort foods from the past and present.
This emphasis tugs the menu beyond the Mediterranean: for example, to Britain (for an excellent fish and chips) and to the Caribbean (for an even better Cuban pork sandwich).
Like Secession most recently, the West Branch opens up the brasserie format to Italy, taking advantage of the popularity (and affordability) of pasta by putting a half dozen such dishes into play. Only two delighted me, the squash and ham tortelli and the shrimp raviolini.
Unevenness plagued the whole menu. Among the appetizers a gorgeous lobster salad kept company with an undersauced vitello tonnato, and superb steak tartare was dragged down by insipid duck liver mousse.
I enjoyed the choucroute garni that accompanied (and rhymed with!) duck confit and the potato salad with the fried quail. But the star of each of those entrees gave the least commanding performance.
Opt instead for the hearty veal stew or the calf’s liver. Know that there are many red wines in the $50-a-bottle range to go with either and that you can finish the night with a generous cookie plate for just $7.
BARBAO exhibits price-consciousness as well, with only one main course exceeding $25. It teams the owners of the restaurant Rain  whose space has been redesigned in a less gimmicky, classier vein  with the chef Michael Bao Huynh, who ran the kitchens at Bao 111, in the East Village, and Mai House, in TriBeCa.
Although hardly anonymous, Mr. Huynh has a lower profile than Mr. Valenti and doesn’t have Mr. Valenti’s traction in this part of town. He’s also working in a genre less immediately recognizable to his audience.
Sizzling cuttlefish? Daikon duck hash? A diner spotting these on the menu may not be sure what’s in store. And that, coupled with glossy good looks that may tag BarBao as more of a splurge than it is, probably works to its disadvantage.
Although the wine list is a bit too expensive and the specialty cocktails a bit too sweet, the food at BarBao is more ambitious and nuanced than at the West Branch, and it reflects Mr. Huynh’s gift for refracting Asian conceits and ingredients through a contemporary prism.
The duck hash, combining cubes of rice cake with shredded duck confit and a poached egg, has one foot in the Far East and the other in fatty, gut-busting Momofuku Manhattan. The cuttlefish defers cunningly to many New York diners’ Mediterranean sensibilities by coming up with a version of salsa verde that adds Vietnamese mint, Thai basil and yuzu to anchovy.
It’s an excellent dish, and so is a loup de mer entree that floats morels in an unusually light, luxuriant coconut and green curry emulsion. Afterward try the yucca waffle with sweet corn, peanuts and dulce de leche. I’m not sure how it fits ethnically into everything else, but it has the mix of savory and sweet  and the degree of salt  that often make a dessert stand out. 
The argument for BarBao is undercut somewhat by Mr. Huynh’s readiness to repeat himself. He has been cooking more than a few of these dishes, or close approximations, for years.
And in the case of the iron pot chicken and the crispy whole red snapper, which was overcooked, he has done them better.
But I suspect it’s not dry fish but rather larger forces that are keeping diners away. Although BarBao could certainly improve, it deserves more attention and affection than it’s getting.

WASHINGTON  If Timothy F. Geithner were a bank, he might well be considered “too big to fail.”
In better economic times, Mr. Geithner’s confirmation to be President-elect Barack Obama’s Treasury secretary might be in danger after the disclosure this week that he had paid more than $48,000 in delinquent taxes and interest. But with the economy so fragile, many senators are loath to rattle financial markets by rejecting someone with Mr. Geithner’s qualifications and international respect. By late Wednesday, Republicans as well as Democrats were predicting he would survive the controversy and be confirmed next week.
Mr. Geithner has broad experience in global economics, financial regulation, currency and monetary policy. And lately, as president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, he has been at the center of the government’s efforts to manage the financial chaos, sharing some criticism for its mixed record but not blame.
“These are not the times to think in small political terms,” said Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina, who just returned from Afghanistan and Pakistan with Vice President-elect Joseph R. Biden Jr., and briefly met with reporters on Wednesday alongside Mr. Obama. “I think he is the right guy.”
Mr. Graham thereby validated what the president-elect had just said: That Mr. Geithner, by bipartisan agreement, is “uniquely qualified.”
“Look, is this an embarrassment for him? Yes. He said so himself,” Mr. Obama said, referring to Mr. Geithner’s remarks in a private meeting with the Senate Finance Committee the day before. But Mr. Obama said Mr. Geithner had made a common mistake and corrected it.
The committee chairman, Senator Max Baucus, Democrat of Montana, early Wednesday postponed Mr. Geithner’s confirmation hearing from Friday to the day after the inauguration. Senators said the delay was unrelated to the tax issue, but at least for a time it will leave Mr. Obama without a Treasury secretary.
The panel’s senior Republican, Senator Charles E. Grassley of Iowa, declined for a second day to take a position on Mr. Geithner’s nomination. In an interview with Iowa reporters, Mr. Grassley reiterated his concern about having a Treasury secretary, with responsibility for the Internal Revenue Service, who had been delinquent on taxes. But he said Mr. Geithner had been “very sincere” in accounting for his violations.
He added: “I don’t believe there’s any doubt about his qualifications. For a partisan person like Obama, appointing a relative political independent as Geithner is, I think that that’s a plus.”
Mr. Geithner called other senators to discuss the controversy, if they wanted, as well as his views on the big issues that otherwise had been expected to dominate his confirmation hearing: an emerging $800 billion economic recovery blueprint, plans for the remaining half of a $700 billion financial bailout fund, and ideas for rewriting regulations for the nation’s financial system to avoid another collapse.
The controversy over his taxes, as it happens, goes to the one area where Mr. Geithner has the least experience, despite serving 13 years at the Treasury Department: domestic tax policy. 
Mr. Geithner, 47, rose from a lower-level civil servant at the department at the end of Ronald Reagan’s presidency to under secretary for international affairs under President Bill Clinton, then was a director of the International Monetary Fund before becoming president of the New York Fed in late 2003. 
Mr. Obama chose Mr. Geithner on Nov. 24, despite knowing of the tax issue.
“Life’s about choices” is a favorite saying of Mr. Geithner’s, according to associates. Lately he has said it so often that he gets laughs even from the professorial Federal Reserve chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, breaking up the unfunny times that the two men  with current Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson Jr.  have had in past months making difficult choices about which institutions to bail out and which to let fail. 
Mr. Obama’s hard choice was between Mr. Geithner and Lawrence H. Summers, who had been Mr. Geithner’s mentor and boss at the Treasury Department in the 1990s, served as Mr. Clinton’s final Treasury secretary and wanted another turn. In a first meeting with Mr. Obama three weeks before the election, Mr. Geithner, in characteristic self-effacement, told him, “Larry would be great as Treasury secretary,” according to someone familiar with the meeting.
But Mr. Summers had drawbacks in the Obama camp’s eyes. He had clear Clinton connections when the “change” campaign was trying to limit those ties. Mr. Summers also was known to have a sometimes difficult personality, and his troubled tenure as president of Harvard University had left some women’s and minority groups bitter and posed potential confirmation problems. 
On Oct. 17, at a New York hotel, Mr. Obama and Mr. Geithner met for an hour and talked about policy and personal matters, according to accounts of the session. Mr. Obama, who spent four childhood years with his mother in Indonesia, asked Mr. Geithner about his own early years in India and then Thailand as his father oversaw Asia development programs for the Ford Foundation.
What neither man knew at the time, but the foundation has confirmed, is that Mr. Geithner’s father, Peter F. Geithner, oversaw a program that Mr. Obama’s mother, Stanley Ann Dunham Soetoro, had worked on. The two may even have met in Jakarta. 
Obama advisers say the candidate “fell in love” with Mr. Geithner, in the words of one, while a Geithner associate said Mr. Geithner reported being “smitten” with Mr. Obama. “They both have that kind of quiet confidence in their demeanor,” the associate said.
When an Obama adviser asked Mr. Geithner if he wanted to be considered for the Treasury job, he said he had to first consult his family  his wife, Carole Sonnenfeld Geithner, a grief counselor for poor New York children whom he had met as an undergraduate at Dartmouth College, and two teenagers, Elise, 17, and Benjamin, 14. The job would also pay less than half of the $411,200 he made last year at the Fed. The family acquiesced, and Mr. Geithner turned over reams of records  including the years of tax returns. 
When Mr. Obama announced the nomination, he also named Mr. Summers as director of the National Economic Council, to coordinate policy from the West Wing. Ever since, the biggest question among associates is how well the two men will get along, what with Mr. Geithner, the onetime underling, now “the chief economic spokesman for my administration,” in Mr. Obama’s words, and Mr. Summers, the former Treasury secretary, enjoying proximity to the Oval Office.
The morning of the announcement, Mr. Geithner and Mr. Summers had breakfast together in the Chicago Hilton. Since the Treasury years, they have continued to consult each other, friends say, and play tennis at economic gatherings. Mr. Geithner told others that he regretted that the weeks of media speculation had focused so much on Mr. Summers’ reputed arrogance. He joked at his own expense that the news media’s story line amounted to, “Larry is arrogant and smart; Geithner’s not so smart but he’s very humble.” 
In truth, Mr. Geithner is known as exceptionally smart and unafraid to speak up  traits that drew Mr. Summers’s attention at the Treasury Department 16 years ago.
“I might worry if I didn’t know it was Tim on the other end of the phone or across the street from Larry,” said a former Treasury Department colleague of both men who did not want to be quoted because of the sensitivity of the confirmation process. “Because I’ve seen them, I’ve seen them clash, I’ve seen them have real, real serious different perspectives on an issue, and I’ve never seen them damage that relationship. And you can’t say that about many people.”
ATLANTIC CITY (AP)  Donald Trump fired himself Friday from the casino company that bears his name.
Spurned by bondholders, who rejected his effort to buy Trump Entertainment Resorts, Mr. Trump and his daughter Ivanka are resigning from its board.
The company won a fourth extension Wednesday on restructuring $1.25 billion in debt, and some analysts have predicted it will file for bankruptcy protection for a third time if it does not work out a deal with its bondholders.
“If I’m not going to run it, I don’t want to be involved in it,” Mr. Trump said Friday. 
Mr. Trump said he recently offered to buy the company, which he used to control before yielding his grip as part of a bankruptcy restructuring.
For now, his name will remain on the company’s three Atlantic City casinos, although Mr. Trump said he might seek to remove his name from the business.
“I don’t like that my name is still going to be on it,” he said.
He also said he wanted to sell his shares in the company, although it was not clear when that might happen or whether he would even be able to under securities laws if he possesses information about the company that is not publicly known.
The company would not identify the bondholders or say who represents them.
Mr. Trump said allies of the bondholders have a 5-to-3 edge on the board of Trump Entertainment Resorts, leading him to believe he was not likely to prevail any time soon in talks on the company’s direction.
The company skipped a $53.1 million biannual payment to bondholders that was due Dec. 1. That led to talks on restructuring the debt, which have been extended four times. The next deadline is Tuesday.
If you would like to test your declarer play, look only at the partial diagram above. You reach four spades, and West leads the heart queen. What would be your plan?
 The deal occurred during a Swiss team event at the District 3 Winter Regional in Rye Brook, N.Y., last month.
 In the auction, North’s two-spade raise showed three or four trumps because they were not using support doubles. Greg Woods (South) jumped to four spades because he was looking at a double fit in the pointed suits.
 After West led the heart queen, declarer assumed, based on the bidding, that East had the club ace hovering over dummy’s king. It was also obvious that the trumps would have to be 3-3. 
But South realized he could not immediately draw trumps, because when he lost a trick to the diamond ace, the defenders would return a heart, leaving him with only nine tricks: four spades, one heart and four diamonds. South had to get five trump tricks by ruffing two hearts in his hand. That, though, would require dummy entries. West would have to have jack-third of spades.
 Woods took the first trick on the board and called for a low diamond. East won with his ace and returned a heart. Declarer ruffed high with his spade queen, played a spade to dummy’s nine, trumped a heart with the spade ace, took a second spade finesse, drew trumps and claimed.
 This was the full deal:



 
 NORTH K 10 9 A 8 6 4 Q 8 3 2 K 2
 


 WEST J 5 4 Q J 5 10 5 4 Q 10 8 7

 EAST 7 6 2 K 10 9 7 3 A A J 6 3


 
 SOUTH A Q 8 3 2 K J 9 7 6 9 5 4
 



 At the other table, East bought it in three hearts, which made, losing three spades and one heart. Plus 620 and plus 140 gave the Woods team 13 international match points.
 Did you notice that East missed a chance to defeat the contract? If he had shifted to a trump at Trick 3, he would have destroyed declarer’s timing.
 The guaranteed line is to win the first trick and immediately to ruff a heart high before driving out the diamond ace. If East returns a heart, declarer would ruff low, cash his spade ace, play a spade to dummy’s ten, draw trumps with the spade king and run the diamonds.
 Or, if East leads back a trump, declarer would take the trick on the board, ruff a heart with his spade ace, pick up trumps and cash the diamonds.
Trump Entertainment Resorts filed for bankruptcy protection before its bondholders could present a petition to do so. The Chapter 11 petition, filed days after its founder, Donald J. Trump, quit the board, listed assets of $2.06 billion and debt of $1.74 billion as of Dec. 31, according to the filing Tuesday in United States Bankruptcy Court in Camden, N.J. 
The N.B.A. trading deadline was a bust, all that hope and anticipation gone to waste unless you were intensely interested in the fate of Rafer Alston. You can pack away your visions of Shaquille O’Neal playing with LeBron James for at least another year. But today brings new hope and anticipation, a new potential savior arriving on the scene: Tiger Woods is coming back.
Cue the trumpets-from-heaven sound clip.
Woods is returning to save golf from Tiger-less oblivion. The news came from the same placeWoods news always comes from: his web site, which curiously does not launch with a trumpets-from-heaven sound clip. Now that he is healthy, maybe he can work on that too.
Up until now, Woods has been busily rehabbing his injured knee and posing for family pictureswith new baby Charlie, proving that, in troubled times, America wants to turn to another black man with an adorable family. His return to golf at next week’s Accenture Match Play Championship came as welcome news to Steve Rushin at golfdigest.com, who details the reasons why Woods’s return feels so therapeutic: “Because golf without Tiger is whiter than C-SPAN, and about as entertaining.” Take that, Phil Mickelson.
Rushin’s point is echoed in sharper fashion by Yahoo’s Dan Wetzel, who says golf should probably start coming up with a Plan B to Tigermania, because banking on one human with a balky knee does not sound like a strong business model.
Even so, baseball could only hope its season was kicking off with trumpets-from-heaven sounds, instead of that incessant buzzing about steroids. There are a few seemingly pleasant stories out there, including Jason Giambi’s happy return to Oakland after his tumultuous Yankee years, although Giambi being an admitted performance-enhancing drug user does bring that buzzing sound back into the picture. And the Wall Street Journal takes a deeper look at the troubling record of the Texas Rangers, with their record of wins, losses and drug cheats.
If that is not sobering enough, join the Washington Post’s Thomas Boswell by taking a nice depressing look at the Washington Nationals’ pratfalls, which includes being duped by identity fraud.
If you prefer to rehash the non-news of the N.B.A. trading deadline, there is plenty of hand-wringing out there for you. Sports Illustrated’s Ian Thomsen explains why it was such a dud. Hint: Money is the root of all dudness. SI’s Chris Mannix then goes through the limited list of winners and losers in the day’s transactions. Or you can judge the day on your own dud-meter, by looking at all the deadline deals since 1987 with this list.
Or you may choose to ponder the Suns’ fate now that Amar’e Stoudemire might miss the rest of the season with an eye injury, or the Celtics’ fate with an injury to Kevin Garnett muddying their future. 
If you prefer your sports involving snow or ice, there is the news of an American winning the first world championships in women’s ski jumping, or the chance to contemplate the idea that Washington’s Alex Ovechkin is the Tiger Woods of hockey, or at least a potential back-to-back M.V.P. 
Hey, we are for anything that brings on that trumpet sound.
 On Tuesday night, President Obama talked about a national culture of irresponsibility. He talked about the way Americans have sacrificed the long term for the short term, spent more than they could afford, and how the country’s leaders have broken promises and delayed reform. Obama described a rot that was ingrained and pervasive. 
 On Thursday, he offered a budget of his own, and the question arises: Will he really change all that? 
 The answer is somewhat, but not enough. Obama’s budget is far more honest than the ones that preceded it. It imposes real pay-as-you-go rules on future outlays. Intellectually serious efforts are made to pay for at least half of the cost of health care reform.
 But the ingrained habits are still there, and the rot is not expunged. Obama enthusiastically perpetuates the myth that the American people can have everything they want without a dose of shared sacrifice. They can have health care, education reform, even a cure for cancer, and 98 percent of them need pay nothing. The burdens of progress will be borne by the rich while everyone else can enjoy their tax cuts and go shopping. 
 Obama perpetuates base-line gimmickry. He claims to save hundreds of billions by drawing down forces in Iraq. But even the Bush administration was going to draw down. Obama is claiming bogus savings by not spending money that never would have been spent anyway. 
 Obama grades himself on a curve. He’s set a target of merely cutting the deficit in half from 2010 to 2013. But the red ink has quadrupled in one year. Cutting the deficit to still unsustainable levels as the economy recovers is about as challenging as riding a sled downhill.
 The greatest shortcomings are sins of omission, not commission. If you watched Obama’s magnificent speech Tuesday night, you got the impression that he bestrides Washington like a colossus. He imposes his authority in ways large and small, purging old habits. In reality, the situation is messier. At times, there is a weird passivity emanating from the White House, a deference to the Washington establishment. Almost no sacred cows are cut from this budget. The president is now engaged in an argument with Democratic appropriators about whether to strike earmarks from the omnibus spending bill. He’s apparently getting rolled even on a matter as easy and clear-cut as this. 
 The bigger problem is health care. This is an issue where everybody wants benefits they don’t pay for, where perverse incentives have created an expensive system that doesn’t deliver results. This is an area where aggressive presidential leadership is mandatory.
 Yet in no other area does the administration cede so much authority. The administration has over-learned the lessons of the Clinton-care fiasco. They’re not going to send up a detailed 1,400-page program. Fine. But they’re not pushing a plan at all.
 Instead, replicating the model that did such harm to the stimulus package, they are merely outlining eight general principles and then sending the matter up to Capitol Hill. They vow to have a series of “conversations” and then presumably at some point some group of committee chairmen will write a bill or a bunch of bills. 
 The balance of power will be clear. The White House will have no dominating figure to ride herd day to day now that Tom Daschle is out of the picture. Instead, the same old chairmen habituated by the same old interest groups will dominate everything. 
 If Hillary Clinton were still in the Senate, at least there would be a focus. If Ted Kennedy were at full strength, the negotiations would be coherent. Instead, there will be a wide array of committee chairmen in the House and Senate scrambling for influence, maneuvering with and against each other through a Machiavellian process of secret negotiations and back-room deals. 
 Thursday, there was a weird burst of optimism in the halls of the Washington Establishment. Most members of Congress and lobbyists are delighted that the White House has surrendered so much authority to Capitol Hill. Everybody is working on a way to push their own particular vision of reform through the muddle.
 There are good plans on offer, but it won’t take long for this to get ugly. We’ll either get an irresponsible bill produced by the Old Order or no bill at all. It could be that even with a thousand “conversations,” no consensus will automatically emerge from the hundreds of players who have produced the gridlock of the past 30 years.
 Even though the budget is not all one would have hoped, I’d trust the folks in the Obama administration to craft a decent health care plan before I’d trust the Congressional Old Bulls. Obama blew a mighty trumpet Tuesday night, but after you blow the trumpet, you actually have to charge. 
Ian Carr, a Scottish-born trumpeter who, like his formidable influence, Miles Davis, was an early practitioner of jazz-rock fusion and later repaid his artistic debt by writing Davis’s biography, died on Feb. 25 in London. He was 75.
The cause was complications after pneumonia and a series of mini-strokes, Alyn Shipton, Mr. Carr’s biographer, said in an e-mail message. An obituary on the Web site iancarrsnucleus.net  dedicated to the music of Mr. Carr and the band, Nucleus, which he founded nearly 40 years ago  said that Mr. Carr had Alzheimer’s disease.
As a writer and researcher, composer and bandleader, Mr. Carr contributed to jazz history both by making music and by explaining it. He started Nucleus in late 1969, a time when jazz musicians were just beginning to find ways of appropriating the tools of rock ’n’ roll. Nucleus mingled traditional jazz instruments (like trumpet, soprano and tenor sax) with rock band staples (like electric bass and electric guitar) and melded improvisations with a driving, creative bass line and urgent, forward-leaning rhythms. It was a hit at the 1970 Montreux Jazz Festival and the Newport Jazz Festival that year as well. 
The band, which had several different rosters, dissolved in the 1980s, though there were several reunions for concert dates and recordings into the 21st century. Its sound was clearly related to that of the rock-infused records Davis was producing as the 1960s turned to the 1970s  “In a Silent Way,” “Bitches Brew” and “A Tribute to Jack Johnson”  and Nucleus pre-dated several better-known bands that became mainstays of jazz-rock fusion, including Weather Report and the Mahavishnu Orchestra. 
In its heyday in the 1970s, Nucleus recorded a dozen or so albums, including “Belladonna,” “Alleycat” and “Out of the Long Dark,” the last reflecting Mr. Carr’s battle with depression. (Mr. Shipton appropriated the title for his 2006 biography.) 
Mr. Carr wrote for several jazz publications, and his first book, “Music Outside: Contemporary Jazz in Britain,” was published in 1973, but his 1982 book, “Miles Davis: A Critical Biography,” was the high point of his writing life. An evenhanded assessment of Davis’s life and music, it distinguished itself by its careful analysis of Davis’s playing and his innovations. Writing about the book in The New York Times Book Review, Bill Zavatsky lauded the clarity of Mr. Carr’s writing and his ability to explain musical technique to the lay reader. (The book was expanded and revised in the 1990s and republished as “Miles Davis: The Definitive Biography.”)
 “He has come as close as any writer can,” Mr. Zavatsky wrote, “to upsetting Davis’s famous dictum that music can’t be talked about and should be left to speak for itself.”
Ian Henry Randell Carr was born April 21, 1933, in Dumfries, Scotland, and was reared in Newcastle-upon-Tyne, in northeastern England. He began playing trumpet as a student at King’s College there, which was then a part of Durham University, and received a degree in English and a teaching certificate. He served in the British Army, and afterward, living in Italy, he began playing with local jazz groups. 
In 1961 his first band in England, the EmCee Five (which also included his brother), recorded a tune, “Let’s Take Five!,” which received wide radio play. Over the next few years he played with a number of prominent musicians, including John McLaughlin (later at the center of the Mahavishnu Orchestra) and Eric Burdon, of the Animals. Before starting Nucleus, he joined with the tenor saxophonist Don Rendell to formed the Rendell/Carr Quintet, which became one of Britain’s best-known jazz bands of the decade.
Mr. Carr’s first wife died in childbirth. His second marriage ended in divorce. He is survived by a daughter, Selina.
In later years, in addition to playing with revived incarnations of Nucleus and other bands, Mr. Carr wrote a book about the pianist Keith Jarrett, contributed to several jazz reference books and was a consultant for television documentaries about Davis and Mr. Jarrett. 
Many reality competitions are adjusting to the changed economy, but it’s a particularly tricky transition for “The Apprentice” on NBC, which began in 2004 as a “greed is good” manifesto by Donald Trump. 
 The subprime mortgage bubble has burst, the real estate market is in disarray, and even the high-flying Mr. Trump is beset by struggling projects that bear his name. Wisely, this installment of the “Apprentice” franchise, the eighth, which began on March 1, repeats last season’s formula of celebrity contestants competing for charity. 
Winning teams are spurred on by cancer drives and aid to the homeless, not, as they were in the first seasons, by a taste of Mr. Trump’s helicopter rides, polo matches and pink-and-gold luxury penthouse.
 The names are not the biggest show business can offer  Joan Rivers and Dennis Rodman are among the headliners  but the basic formula still works, and Mr. Trump manages to preside with a straight face. 
That was a little harder for Sunday’s guest judge, Erin Burnett, a CNBC business news anchor, who took the place filled by Mr. Trump’s daughter Ivanka on the premiere episode.
 NBC keeps testing the limits between news and entertainment in pursuit of cross-promotional synergy. 
Ms. Burnett, whose day job is to report on the teetering economy, was shown last Sunday night shilling for Mr. Trump. It’s one thing for NBC to promote the reputation of a business tycoon who makes money for the network; there’s no synergy in denting the credibility of one of its most visible business reporters.

Ian Henry Randell Carr was born on April 21, 1933, in Dumfries, Scotland, and grew up in Newcastle-upon-Tyne, in northeastern England. He began playing trumpet as a student at King’s College there, which was then part of Durham University, and received a degree in English and a teaching certificate. He served in the British Army, and afterward, living in Italy, he began playing with local jazz groups. 
In 1961 his first band in England, the EmCee Five (which also included his brother), recorded a tune, “Let’s Take Five!,” which received wide radio play. Over the next few years he played with various prominent musicians, including John McLaughlin (later at the center of the Mahavishnu Orchestra) and Eric Burdon, of the Animals. Before starting Nucleus, he joined with the tenor-saxophonist Don Rendell to form the Rendell/Carr Quintet, which became one of the best-known British jazz bands of the decade.
Mr. Carr’s first wife died in childbirth. His second marriage ended in divorce. He is survived by a daughter, Selina.
In later years, in addition to playing with revived incarnations of Nucleus and other bands, Mr. Carr wrote a book about the pianist Keith Jarrett, contributed to several jazz reference books and was a consultant for television documentaries about Davis and Mr. Jarrett. 
 To start today here is a declarer-play problem: If you were South in seven diamonds, what would be your plan after West leads the heart six?
 The Nordic Junior Championship took place last weekend in Reykjavik, Iceland. Seven teams entered, four junior (under 26), two schools and one girls. Each team played two 14-board matches against the other six. Only the results among the four junior teams determined the Nordic title, the winners being Sweden, with 108 victory points, ahead of Norway (105) and Denmark (102). But if all the results had counted, Norway would have won from Denmark and Sweden.
 The diagramed deal, Board 2 of Round 9, was the most interesting of the tournament. It was shown to me by Roland Wald of Denmark.
 The board was played six times. In the match between Denmark School and Iceland School, both pairs played in six spades, made with an overtrick for a flat board. The Denmark Juniors got to seven spades and gained 11 international match points when the Denmark Girls stopped in six spades.
 The Sweden Junior pair of Cecilia Rimstedt (South) and Mikael Gronkvist stopped in six spades, making seven.
 The given sequence was produced by the Iceland Junior pair of Johann Siguroarson (South) and Gabriel Gislason. Two clubs was fourth-suit game-forcing. Five clubs was Exclusion Roman Key Card Blackwood, promising a void in clubs and asking for key cards outside clubs. Five hearts indicated one key card, five no-trump asked for the spade queen, and six diamonds showed it along with the diamond king. Now South bid seven diamonds to offer a choice of grand slams, which North accepted because he had the diamond queen.
 Both grand slams are excellent. In seven diamonds, though, you must allow for the possibility that East has jack-fourth of trumps. After winning the first trick in your hand and playing a trump to dummy’s queen, ruff a club to reduce your trump length. You play a second trump to dummy, seeing West discard, and ruff another club. Now your trump length is the same as East’s. 
Cash the heart jack and spade ace, play a spade to dummy’s queen and lead winning hearts. If East ever ruffs, overruff, draw his last trump and claim because your spades are high. Alternatively, if East discards on all of the hearts, so do you. At Trick 12 the lead from the dummy catches East’s doubleton jack-eight of diamonds in a trump coup.
 Sadly, declarer immediately cashed dummy’s two trumps and could no longer make his contract.
 Plus 1,010 and plus 50 gave Sweden 14 imps on the board. The winning team was Eric Arvidsson, Simon Bech, Gronkvist and Rimstedt.
 This was the full deal: (See Diagram 2)
On the final day of the Long Island Regional in Smithtown on Sunday, the winners of the Open Top Flight Swiss Teams were Debbie and Michael Rosenberg of New Rochelle, N.Y., and Andrew Rosenthal and Aaron Silverstein of New York. They finished more than one match ahead of Glenn Milgrim, Barry Rigal and Jared Lilienstein of New York and Jacek Pszczola of Chapel Hill, N.C.
 The winners scored well on the diagramed deal.
 East doubled three no-trump to ask for a heart lead, the first suit bid by the dummy. He was hoping West or South had the heart eight, but in that case maybe declarer could have gained by playing low from the board on the first trick.
 Then Silverstein (South) redoubled. Assuming at the other table that three no-trump was undoubled, if the contract was making, the redouble would increase the gain to 9 international match points from 4. If both tables were going down one, redoubling would increase the loss to 7 imps from 3. Also, lucrative overtricks at 400 points each looked more likely than multiple undertricks.
 East took dummy’s heart king with his ace and returned the heart jack to dummy’s queen. Declarer played a spade to his king, led a club to dummy’s queen, returned a spade to his queen and played a third spade. East now cashed his two heart winners to stop an overtrick.
 At the other table South rebid three clubs, fourth-suit forcing, keeping open the chance that his partner had three-card spade support. North closed the auction in three no-trump.
 Debbie Rosenberg (East) led her club six. Probably declarer should have taken the trick with his queen and played a spade to the queen, but he won with South’s ten and led a diamond to his jack. 
When the finesse won, North played a spade to the king and called for another diamond, ducking West’s eight. (He was hoping for a later dummy entry if diamonds were 3-2, but winning with the ace and trying to guess spades looked better.)
 Michael Rosenberg (West) would have beaten the contract for sure if he had shifted to his singleton heart, which was not obvious. (If North plays an honor, East wins with the ace and returns the jack, giving the defense one spade, three hearts and one diamond. Or if North plays a low heart, East wins cheaply and can either cash the heart ace, then play a club, or lead a club immediately.)
 West, though, returned a club, hoping to kill the dummy. He correctly anticipated that North would lead a heart next. This allowed East to capture the king with her ace and return the jack. Now North had to go down two.
 However, declarer could have made his contract. After winning the club in the South hand, he plays a diamond to his ace, leads a spade to South’s queen, concedes a spade, wins East’s heart shift and gives West the lead with the diamond king. West must bring the dummy back to life.
 Plus 1,000 and plus 200 gave the winners 15 international match points on the board.
Jessica Lappin, a first-term city councilwoman from the Upper East Side of Manhattan, has been known to answer the phone singing the fight song: “Meet the Mets, meet the Mets, step right up and greet the Mets!” 
Councilman James Oddo of Staten Island becomes Facebook friends with minor-league players so he knows about them if they are drafted by his beloved Mets or become available in his fantasy baseball league. 
Speaker Christine C. Quinn is a Yankees fan, not by birth but, she said, “out of love.” She rooted for the Mets until her partner, a Yankees loyalist from New Jersey, made her choose: the relationship or the Mets.
Beneath the civility and protocol that dictate life at City Hall lies a patchwork of baseball passions, resentments and rivalries that the public seldom sees. Forget fault lines of party or borough: The true divide is whether your team wears pinstripes, orange and blue, or even (horrors!) the dreaded crimson stockings.
And as is common with the Council, idiosyncrasies and oddities abound: Among all New Yorkers, for example, Yankees fans outnumber Met loyalists by nearly two to one, according to polls. But among the council members it is a different story: The number of Mets partisans exceeds Yankee supporters, 18 to 13, according to a survey of members by The New York Times.
Seven council members  echoing Hillary Clinton in 1999, when she was running for Senate  said they liked both teams; 10 said they did not follow any team; one Brooklynite said he favored the minor-league Cyclones, who play at Coney Island; and another said his loyalty was to the Dodgers  the team that played at Ebbets Field, not the one now housed in Chavez Ravine in Los Angeles.
Then there is Bill de Blasio, an up-and-coming councilman from Park Slope, Brooklyn, now running for the citywide office of public advocate. Mr. de Blasio, who grew up in Cambridge, Mass., roots for the Boston Red Sox. And despite his ambitions, he is not shy about displaying his feelings.
Mr. de Blasio and Erik Martin Dilan of Bushwick, Brooklyn, have had a running bet for six years. If the Red Sox win the American League East division, Mr. Dilan buys Mr. de Blasio a steak at Peter Luger Steak-house. If the Yankees win, Mr. de Blasio buys the steak.
In 2004, when the Red Sox overcame a three-game deficit to the Yankees to earn a spot in the World Series, Mr. de Blasio took matters a step further: He required Mr. Dilan to wear a Red Sox cap at a Council meeting, rise and make a speech praising the Boston club.
Mr. de Blasio gloated, “He was very uncomfortable, but he honored the agreement.”
Mr. de Blasio, who is raising his children to be Red Sox fans, said that “everyone should be proud of whatever team they root for.” (He added that among New York teams, he has a soft spot for the Mets.)
Still other council members worry about his exposure as a Sox fan. “If I were Bill de Blasio, I wouldn’t publicize that too much,” warned John C. Liu of Queens, a Mets man.
Speaker Quinn is not one to loudly advertise her Yankee leanings, but smiled when recalling the time a bill sponsored by a Mets fan was approved by the Council and a Yankee-loving member yelled out, “At least something you support is moving forward!”
“Now that’s got to hurt,” she said with a chuckle.
This being an election year, some council members were not very eager to answer when The Times posed a seemingly simple question: Which of the hometown teams is your favorite? 
“It’s more complicated than you think,” said Councilman G. Oliver Koppell of the Bronx. After smiling uncomfortably, Mr. Koppell finally said he was a Yankee fan first, but also liked the Mets. What happens when the teams face each other? “I plead the Fifth,” he replied.
Some Italian-Americans, including the former Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, have long had an affection for the Yankees. But such fondness was not reflected among the council members. Of the eight members with Italian surnames, none identified as a Yankee fan, though Peter F. Vallone Jr. of Queens said he supported both teams.
In a breakdown by borough, interesting allegiances emerge: Queens, home to Citi Field, is of course the most Mets-mad; all but 3 of its 14 members root for the Mets exclusively. One of them, Councilwoman Helen Sears, boasted that she has a jacket she has not washed or worn since it was signed by the third baseman David Wright. 
Staten Island is mostly Mets territory: Two council members like the Mets, one follows soccer. 
The Bronx is more surprising. Though home to baseball’s most storied franchise, the borough has only three diehard Yanks fans. Two council members say they support both teams, and three do not cheer for either.
Councilwoman Helen D. Foster of the Bronx said that she used to root for the Yankees “before they destroyed my community,” referring to the construction of the team’s new $1.5 billion stadium, which replaced public tennis and basketball courts, baseball and soccer fields, and a running track with smaller parks.
Brooklyn is the most agnostic: 8 of the borough’s 16 representatives do not favor any one specific team.
Councilman Mathieu Eugene said that although he is not a fan, he respects anyone who plays sports “because it’s a healthy habit.” 
And Councilman Simcha Felder of Brooklyn, the impish former tax auditor who is a member of the Council’s Committee for Governmental Operations, explained his lack of affinity for either team this way: “Do I look like a person who watches people play?”
BALMEDIE, Scotland  Since refusing to let Donald Trump buy his house, inconveniently located in the middle of Mr. Trump’s planned $1.5 billion development in the countryside here, Michael Forbes has had an unusual number of visits from local enforcement officers. 
One, he said, came to see whether he was abusing his hens, his geese or his horse (he was not). Another came to see whether he had an unlicensed shotgun (he did not). And a third came to investigate reports that there was a flammable substance in an old tanker on his land (there was not). 
Mr. Forbes, a fisherman and granite quarry worker who has lived here for 41 years, since he was 15, said he did not care and would not move, no matter who wanted him to. But the unpleasant attention he is getting, regardless of who is behind it, comes as no surprise to the scattered, battered opponents of Mr. Trump’s grand golf-and-housing project, which already has preliminary approval and may start construction early next year.
 Bruised by a fruitless effort to block the plans, they are learning that in a time of financial misery, few people are sympathetic to arguments that appear to put the environment over the economy. 
Mr. Trump swept in a few years ago and bought 1,400 acres here at the edge of the North Sea, eight miles from Aberdeen (Mr. Forbes’s 23-acre holding is part of the project site, on a fragile, frequently foggy, shifting sand dune). Mr. Trump pronounced it the perfect place to build two golf courses, a 450-bedroom hotel, 950 vacation homes, 500 single-family houses, a conference center and a golf academy. 
Environmentalists across Scotland reacted with horror, arguing that the area had special environmental protection and that the project was far too big, anyway. But residents did not want to hear about the environment, and did not react kindly when a local planning committee voted to reject the plan. 
The seven officials who voted “no” found themselves in an Aberdeen newspaper under the headline “You Traitors.” The paper Photoshopped their heads onto pictures of turnips, Scottish symbols of stupidity. 
The decision was overturned, when the Scottish government in Edinburgh stepped in and convened its own planning inquiry, which approved the project. 
Since then, Martin Ford, an elected official who as chairman of the local committee cast the deciding vote against the plan, has been stripped of the chairmanship and other committee posts. This has caused him to lose nearly half his previous annual income of about $40,000, he said.
He said he had been vindicated by hundreds of supportive e-mail messages and letters. In January, a Scottish architecture Web site and magazine gave the project one of its Carbuncle Cup prizes: the Pockmark Award for the worst planning decision of 2008.
Critics of the project are as bitterly against it as they always were, but with planning approval already granted there is not much they can do to stop it. They haven’t stopped trying, though. In March, for instance, a group of airport expansion opponents put on Donald Trump masks and briefly seized Aberdeen Airport (they were arrested).
None of this bothers Mr. Trump, who remains extremely pleased about the project and his ability to pay for it. (The recent unpleasantness, where Trump Entertainment Resorts went bankrupt, he says, had little to do with him because it was no longer his company.) 
“This is probably the most unique piece of property in the world for what we’re doing,” he declared in a telephone interview. He added, “I just sold a house for $100 million in Palm Beach, though I don’t want to be bragging.” 
In a letter to a local elected official, Debra Storr, he also said, “It has become clear to everyone that your bitter and negative campaign against this project is purely motivated by self-interest.”
People here are not sure what to make of Mr. Trump, who has a tendency to fly in to Balmedie on his private jet, issue a string of statements about the superiority of his plans while his unusual hair blows around in the brisk Scottish wind, and then fly out again. 
They are not sure he understands Scotland, for one thing, for all that he says about his plans to spend a lot of his time here, eventually, in his newly refurbished 14th-century manor house. 
“I’m all for development and for people building golf resorts,” said one local resident, Bill Grant, 54, who spoke in downtown Aberdeen. “But he’s doing it in the wrong place.”
 Mr. Grant explained that the dunes tend to suffer from the notorious haar, a thick fog that pours in from the sea. “You cannot see your hand in front of your face, and if the wind goes calm it can stick there for days,” Mr. Grant said. “If you were playing golf, you would need a homing device to find your ball.” 
As for Mr. Forbes, he is holding firm. Mr. Trump, who called Mr. Forbes’s property “a monstrosity,” said that either Mr. Forbes should be forced to clean up his various outbuildings, or his property should be condemned.
 Mr. Forbes has retaliated against such remarks by painting a large anti-Trump slogan on the side of his barn. He also sent back, unopened, the last letter he got from the Trump Organization.
“I think I’ll be annoying them more than they’ll be annoying me,” he said. 
WASHINGTON (AP)  The Pittsburgh Penguins can say they have outplayed the Washington Capitals and had the perseverance to overcome a two-game deficit to take the series lead.
But the Pittsburgh star Sidney Crosby would be the first to acknowledge that the Penguins are ahead because the puck was deflected into the net by a Capitals player in overtime. Twice.
Evgeni Malkin’s pass to Crosby was broken up by the sliding defenseman Tom Poti, who helplessly watched the puck sail past goalie Simeon Varlamov 3 minutes 28 seconds into overtime Saturday to give the Penguins a 4-3 victory in Game 5 of the Eastern Conference semifinals.
“These games come down to mistakes and bounces,” Crosby said. “And we got a good bounce there.”
The Penguins overcame a third-period deficit and survived Alex Ovechkin’s tying goal with 4:08 left in regulation before winning on Malkin’s goal, which came with a second remaining in a power play. Malkin had drawn a tripping penalty on Milan Jurcina, who stopped him on a possible breakaway.
The final goal brought flashbacks to Game 3, when Kris Letang’s winner was deflected in by Capitals defenseman Shaone Morrisonn.
“It’s always hard when you play in overtime and you allow a silly goal like this,” Varlamov said through an interpreter. “That’s twice now.”
Jordan Staal, Ruslan Fedotenko and Matt Cooke also scored, and Marc-Andre Fleury made 28 saves for the Penguins, who have won three straight after dropping the first two games. They can close out the series Monday night in Pittsburgh.
“We’ve been in this position before,” said Washington Coach Bruce Boudreau, referring to the Capitals’ rally from a 3-1 deficit to beat the Rangers in the first round. “It’s a tough hill to climb, but you’ve just got to think of it as one game.”
Ovechkin scored twice, giving him 10 goals in the playoffs.
The trumpeter John McNeil’s imagination is right on the line between jazz at its most secure and coded and jazz as an open window, letting anything in and out of its house. For the last five years or so he’s been running bands that tend to have a slightly arch repertory concept: the pointed and airy West Coast jazz of the 1950s or the pains and pleasures of the infamous amateur rock band the Shaggs. 
His new quartet, in its third month of weekly gigs at Puppets Jazz Bar in Park Slope, Brooklyn  three sets every Wednesday  has no concept in particular and uses more of his own compositions. Perhaps it’s more flexible as a result.
Mr. McNeil’s tone is soft and thin, sort of ribbonlike; he doesn’t use the trumpet for its ruckus potential, and he’s interested in even and elaborate melodic improvisation through moving harmony. The young tenor saxophone player in his band, Noah Preminger, works beautifully through chord changes, but he’s also interested in speed and sound: split-tones and big Ben Webster-like notes that are three-quarters air and one-quarter music. But they don’t settle into purely opposite roles. Mr. McNeil goes foggy and abstract at times, retaining a singing feeling. 
With the bassist Mike McGuirk and the drummer Rudy Royston, on Wednesday the band played a couple of standards  a slow “Where or When,” with a long, expressive trumpet solo, and “Try a Little Tenderness,” with a gradual, inventive wind-up toward the core of the song. It also played “Rondette,” an obscure and dryly beautiful piece by Bob Zieff that Chet Baker recorded in 1955. (With its tricky, rapid chord changes it could have been an étude for improvisers, had it ever had its moment in the sun.) 
Looser and more exciting, the band also played an original, a fast line based on a sturdy model  “I Got Rhythm”  with references to a bebop song based on those same chord changes, Jimmy Heath’s “C.T.A.” Mr. McNeil is a respected figure among a few generations of jazz musicians, and there’s an intricate hipness about his performances: in his late 50s now, he’s old enough to remember the jazz musician’s consensus language of secret references. 
There’s also a funny defiance about him. He couldn’t say the name of the last tune, he said, because it was too rude. (As written on top of the sheet music, it’s a common insult, perhaps for a common set of chord changes.) And when the audience pressed him on it, he wouldn’t budge.
CANNES, France  It goes by a single name, but the Cannes Film Festival is a hydra-headed beast. For most of the world it is a red-carpet event, a seductively foreign affair in which glamorous stars wave at the cameras on their way into films that, save for the larger studio releases, much of the world will probably never see. This is the Cannes where art triumphs over industry (if not necessarily good taste), a festival of auteurs whose work has, at least in the United States, become increasingly difficult to sell to the public. This is the Cannes that, in time, shows up piecemeal at places like Film Forum in New York or through download on cable. 
 And then there is the Cannes where movies like “Hitler Goes Kaput!” (“Over $12M at the Russian box office!”), “Kambakkht Ishq” (a Bollywood film shot in Hollywood and featuring Sylvester Stallone) and “Stripped Naked” (“Cassie’s done stripping... Now she’s about to blow you away!”) are for sale, finished or not. These are the titles that dominate the warren of booths that fill the lower floor of the Palais, the festival headquarters. There, amid this year’s noticeably thinned ranks of buyers and sellers, gaudy posters for lookalike thrillers from Iceland to India compete for attention alongside more sober endeavors, like the brochures for the Kenyan Department of Film Services (“Motto: Efficiency is our strength”) and the Era New Horizons (“the biggest film festival in Poland”).
 Upstairs in the two grand theaters where much of the main lineup is presented  now increasingly in digital, as in the market theaters  creativity rather than commerciality dominates the conversation and sometimes the screens. Midway through the 62nd festival a few critical favorites have emerged, notably “A Prophet,” a sensational prison film and moral history from the French director Jacques Audiard that could just as easily be titled “Sentimental Education: The Story of a Young Criminal.” The newcomer Tahar Rahim plays Malik, an illiterate innocent who, while in a French prison, comes under the brutal protection of a Corsican gang leader, played with animal ferocity by Niels Arestrup. (Mr. Arestrup played another paternalistic criminal in Mr. Audiard’s previous film, “The Beat That My Heart Skipped.”)
 Sweeping and precisely observed  in one scene a gunman stares transfixed at a pair of expensive shoes in a shop window before committing a multiple hit  the film tells the story of one person that eventually becomes a story of an entire world ordered by violence. Using an occasional surrealistic flourish  a ghost makes regular appearances, at one point engulfed in flames  Mr. Audiard tracks Malik’s descent into this underworld with transparent compassion but none of the sentimentalizing that softens and cheapens too many mob stories. You see how violence is inscribed on Malik’s body, in old scars and new wounds, some of which he opens himself, some of which the Corsican inflicts. Prison takes care of the rest. 
 Other festival favorites include “Bright Star,” from the New Zealand-born director Jane Campion, making a strong return more than five years after her last feature, “In the Cut.” Set in 1818 this sumptuously photographed love story explores the passionate if virtuous love affair between the British poet John Keats (played by a suitably brooding beauty, Ben Whishaw) and a young fashion devotee, Fanny Brawne (Abbie Cornish). Working with the cinematographer Greig Fraser, Ms. Campion brings an extraordinary tactility to her images, particularly through her representation of touch. With delicacy and caressing light that self-consciously invokes Vermeer, she distills desire through the flutter of fingers against a rough bit of cloth, though I do sometimes wish there were a bit more wildness amid the fluttering.
 Another highlight is “Vengeance,” a brilliantly directed genre study from the Hong Kong master Johnnie To in which the French legend Johnny Hallyday pays a blood-soaked visit to Macao. There he hires three Chinese gunmen (led by Anthony Wong), whom Mr. To consistently arranges in triangular formations that give his widescreen compositions incredible dynamism. With his ruined face and pale snake eyes Mr. Hallyday holds the screen while Mr. To shakes it up. Equally impressive if far more visually streamlined is “Police, Adjective,” from the Romanian director Corneliu Porumboiu. Further proof of the strength of the Romanian New Wave, this deadpan meditation on authority and moral conscience is playing out of the main competition, despite being one of the finest films at this year’s festival. 
 For critics these red-carpet entries are the main event, though there are side attractions, including what publicists like to call interview opportunities with the talent. There are news conferences, official dinners, beach parties and round-table encounters during which select journalists play a version of musical chairs, moving together from one table to the next to talk briefly with a director and some of the cast and crew. There are also a multitude of pseudo-events, during which a producer or a star, say, announces a new venture, which is how I ended up on Friday in a modest ballroom at one of the grand hotels with a hundred or so mostly Europeans to listen to a pitch from the king of comedy, Jerry Lewis. 
 Wearing a bright blue jacket and flanked by photos of himself holding the Oscar he received in March for his humanitarian work, Mr. Lewis sat at a long table and worked the room hard. “Jerry’s here to announce the film he will be starring in next October,” the French translator said. “We’re going to do ‘Mutiny on the Bounty’ again,” Mr. Lewis said, as laughter filled the room. “I’m playing the Christian part, and we need an Arab so we can beat” the stuffing “out of him.” Silence fell like a lead curtain. Being an old nightclub performer, he didn’t use the word stuffing. Being an old nightclub guy, he also recovered fast, but he clearly wasn’t going to make himself especially loveable. I wonder if he ever had. 
The screenplay, “Max Rose”  about a widower’s relationship with his daughter  he explained, is “marvelous.” He talked about his Oscar (“It was an incredible feeling and one that is very difficult to talk about”) and complained about the lack of questions. (“If you’ve come here to stare, I don’t need you here.”) The last time he was at Cannes 800 people showed up, he said, joking that they were either on the beach or with Martin Scorsese, who was holding a news conference elsewhere to announce the formation of the World Cinema Foundation, a nonprofit dedicated to preserving and restoring neglected films. Mr. Scorsese is the best, Mr. Lewis said: “You have to work with him to find out just how good he is.”
The premier event at the Eastern States Regional, organized by the Greater New York Bridge Association, is the Goldman Pairs. It is the oldest regional pair championship in the country, and the winners of the 81st title last Sunday were R. Jay Becker of New York and Michael Rosenberg of New Rochelle, N.Y., who also won last year. 
With a top of 19 match points, the winners had 586.92, just ahead of David Herman and Artur Malinowski from England (584.13) and Sherry Jackson and Bjorn Fallenius of New York (581.43).
 The winners defended perfectly on the diagramed deal from the first final session.
 South’s two-club rebid was checkback, promising at least game-invitational values and asking for more information. When North showed three-card heart support, South jumped to game.
 Rosenberg (West) led the diamond four, lowest from an odd number or third-highest from an even number. (Many would have led the nine, top of nothing, to deny an honor in the suit. Rosenberg prefers to give count on opening lead, not attitude. But, as you will soon see, he is a firm believer in attitude shifts.)
 Declarer took East’s jack with his ace and led the heart jack, which Becker (East) ducked to see in what order West played his trumps. South continued with a trump to dummy’s king and East’s ace. West had played first the heart six, then the five, as a suit-preference signal for spades.
 East therefore shifted to a spade, selecting the six, second-highest from a relatively weak suit when the top two cards in the suit were not touching.
 Reading this correctly, West took declarer’s king with his ace and switched back to diamonds. Now South had to lose one trick in each suit.
 Plus 100 was worth 15.5 match points out of 19.
 At some tables East could not resist overcalling one spade. Then West led the spade ace, and four hearts could no longer be defeated.
Game 3 of the N.B.A. Finals cruised to first place in Tuesday’s ratings. According to ratings numbers from Nielsen, ABC’s prime-time coverage of the Orlando Magic-Los Angeles Lakers matchup attracted 14. 2 million viewers, lifting that network to No. 1 for the night in the demographic of adults 18 to 49. NBC, which broadcast Game 6 of the Stanley Cup Finals, between the Pittsburgh Penguins and the Detroit Red Wings, finished second in that age group. The game averaged only 5.8 million total viewers, falling well short of CBS’s lineup, which included repeats of “NCIS” (11.1 million) and “The Mentalist” (11.6 million).
At first blush Arve Henriksen and Nils Petter Molvaer might seem nearly indistinguishable. Both are pristine-sounding Norwegian trumpeters with conspicuous investment in electronics. They share a fondness for fragile lyricism and rippling atmosphere, building on a 40-year tradition that began with the Miles Davis album “In a Silent Way.” Both have pushed toward modern fusions, imbuing chamberlike or folkloric pop music with currents of improvisation. Each has recorded for the German label ECM. 
But judging by their successive sets at Le Poisson Rouge on Tuesday night, Mr. Henriksen and Mr. Molvaer might as well come from different planets. Performing to an enthusiastic full house the two trumpeters presented distinct visions of a post-Miles landscape. There was overlap between them, but the dissimilarities were more striking, and perhaps more telling. 
Mr. Molvaer advanced a familiar brand of electrojazz, oscillating between chilly calm and steep propulsion. Appearing in a late headlining slot with two accompanists, the guitarist Eivind Aarset and the drummer Audun Kleive, he fashioned his first piece into an overture: starting in a fog, it gradually took shape and ended with a riot of samba rhythm. Mr. Molvaer made shrewd, ample use of his digital filters. He refracted some horn lines as if through a harmonic prism and polished others with a metallic gleam. 
Mechanism occupies a central chapter in Mr. Molvaer’s playbook. During one lively stretch in his set, he barely used his trumpet, focusing instead on the dials at his console. His final tune  “Cruel Altitude,” from a new European release, “Hamada” (Sula Records)  took on a brutal intensity, with his trumpet slashing bladelike through blasts of distortion. 
There was no such moment in Mr. Henriksen’s more human-scale performance, which drew in small part from an austere new ECM album, “Cartography.” He played seated, entrusting the electronics almost fully to an understated partner, Jan Bang. (Mr. Aarset and Mr. Kleive appear on “Cartography” too, but they didn’t join in here.) 
Mr. Henriksen has little use for effects on the trumpet: his arsenal of manual techniques is astonishment enough. For much of the set he worked with a controlled and penetrating tone, sounding disconcertingly flutelike. He also used the instrument to produce sharp whinnies, breathy slurs, lingual flutters and braying foghorn calls. At times he played with a saxophone mouthpiece or without a mouthpiece entirely. Echo was his only sustained indulgence. 
What kept his devices from feeling larkish was a sly vocal intimation: even at his most weirdly expressive, Mr. Henriksen seemed to be speaking or singing through his horn. For this reason it felt only natural when he did vocalize, first in a plaintive Arabic style and then in a haunting choirboy falsetto. It was all gorgeous and engrossing, coming across as less armored than Mr. Molvaer’s output and altogether more original. 
MOSCOW  Just months after it was embarrassed by the defection of a Russian conscript soldier to Georgia, Russia made a countermove on Friday. It brandished its own military defector, a Georgian officer, apparently seeking to score points in the countries’ propaganda war. 
Though the Russian military quickly defeated Georgia’s smaller forces in the war in August, Georgia has proved more adept on the public relations front. The sides have sparred continually in the news media, at international conferences and even on the dance floor. 
Georgia paraded around the Russian conscript, Junior Sgt. Aleksandr Glukhov, like a championship trophy. He defected in January, he said, because his commanding officer verbally abused him and because he was denied enough food and a bath. 
Russia struck back by introducing Alik D. Bzhania, a lieutenant in the Georgian Army, at a packed news conference here. Mr. Bzhania, 35, described how on May 23 he left his post as a navigator on a coast guard cruiser, changed into civilian clothes and crossed into Russia, seeking political asylum. It is unclear what he has been doing in Russia between the time of his defection and his media debut on Thursday, when he gave an interview to the radio station Echo Moskvy. 
In that interview and at the news conference on Friday, he spoke of his anger at Georgia’s president, Mikheil Saakashvili, and of creeping fears of a renewed confrontation with Russia. 
“I thought that after the August conflict, Saakashvili would come to his senses,” he said. “But there have been no changes. Reserves are being enlisted, and the army is being called up. I do not want to fight against Russia, so I left.” 
In recent months, Georgia’s opposition has held near continuous protests seeking the resignation of Mr. Saakashvili, whom it accuses of reneging on promises of democratic reform and of provoking the war with Russia.
Mr. Bzhania, however, said he was never involved in politics. In fact, he rejoined the military in October after a stint as a construction worker and thus did not fight in the war. He complained about his monthly salary of $300 but said that otherwise his life as an officer was “great.” 
In an interview with Echo Moskvy radio, Temuri Yakobashvili, Georgia’s minister of reintegration, called the affair “a very cheap provocation.” 
He added, “The Georgian leadership laughs at these gimmicks by the Russian special services.” 
The trumpeter Tim Hagans makes an art and science out of assertiveness. Repeatedly during his first set at Birdland on Wednesday night he unfurled long arcs of eighth notes, clipping each one neatly at the end. His businesslike facility on the instrument, along with the hard gleam of his tone, was impressive even when it wasn’t quite absorbing.
A decade ago Mr. Hagans applied these skills toward a millennial upwelling of fusion, working intently with electronic textures and mechanized rhythms. His aims were ultramodern, and his execution  on a pair of impetuous Blue Note albums, his last for that label  earned some acclaim. But Mr. Hagans might have begun to feel that he was painting himself into a corner. He now works mainly in an acoustic postbop mode, seeking a similar air of progressivism, but with a subtler, less frenetic feel.
His current quintet could hardly be better suited to the task. It features a pair of advanced harmonic colorists, the guitarist John Abercrombie and the pianist Marc Copland, who share an affinity for softly luminescent chords. The bassist Drew Gress and the drummer Bill Stewart, who have worked often with Mr. Copland, round out the rhythm section. Mr. Hagans enlisted more or less the same crew for his two most recent albums, on the German label Pirouet: “Alone Together” (2008) and “Beautiful Lily” (2005).
“Beautiful Lily,” the title track of one of those albums, imbued the performance with its only dose of vulnerability. The song’s shadowy melody would have been better served by an open horn, as on the album, than by a Harmon mute, which inexorably evoked Miles Davis. But Mr. Hagans played it with admirably solemn concentration before yielding the floor to Mr. Abercrombie, whose solo was a model of coherent flow, and Mr. Copland, who made a concise statement feel capacious and open-ended. 
“Immediate Left,” an aggressive scrap of a tune, struck the opposite tone, with jabbing accents and surging rhythm. It ended up as a showpiece for Mr. Stewart’s restlessly alert drumming, and not just during his no-holds-barred solo. (Billy Hart, who replaces Mr. Stewart on Friday and Saturday, should be no less daring or resourceful in the role.) 
The rest of the set offered variations on standard forms. “No Words” was a leisurely abstraction on “I Got Rhythm” changes (George Gershwin), while “First Jazz” charged through a harmonic sequence descended from “Milestones” (Miles Davis). 
And “Space Dozen” was a loping blues, in a manner of speaking: its melodic obliqueness attested to the influence of 12-tone classical modernism. “We’re going to play the blues in all keys at once,” Mr. Hagans said in his introduction, sounding typically self-assured.
Ditzingen, Germany
STRIDING into a hangarlike building with several of her top executives, Nicola Leibinger-Kammüller looks every bit the boss as she settles in for a two-hour survey of the latest research projects at Trumpf, a maker of laser machine tools.
So there is something unnerving, especially in a country that values formalities, about the behavior of the male executive responsible for production and sales. As Mrs. Leibinger-Kammüller peers down into a machine that uses a laser to slice through metal, the man places his hands on her midsection to reorient her view. As the two squint upward at a lens, he drapes his arm around her shoulder.
The body language between Mrs. Leibinger-Kammüller and her lieutenant speaks volumes about how the company really functions. His name is Mathias Kammüller; he is her husband of 25 years.
At this family-owned company, based in the rolling hills outside Stuttgart, each of the 8,000 employees is treated as a close relative. It is a model that warms the hearts of Germans, often leery of bare-knuckled “Anglo-Saxon” ways. Trumpf also has been immensely successful, with $422 million in profit in the 2008 fiscal year. 
“The responsibility I have for our employees is what is dearest to my heart,” Mrs. Leibinger-Kammüller says. “It’s not the family’s wealth. It’s not our standing with the public.”
But any company that would treat its employees as family is on a collision course with reality, and none more so than Trumpf. The worldwide business cycle that vacuumed up its exports for the last four years has ground to a halt. The German economy is expected to shrink by 6 percent this year, and Trumpf expects to fare even worse.
This rapid deterioration in business is forcing Trumpf executives to contemplate layoffs for the first time in 20 years even as the company uses peculiarly German tricks, from clever time management to an assist from the welfare state, to avoid them.
“What vexes me day and night is the idea that I would have to lay people off,” Mrs. Leibinger-Kammüller says. But by year-end, that may be unavoidable.
Trumpf belongs to a collection of German companies know as the Mittelstand. Family-owned though not necessarily family-run, they typically make things that are unknown to the public but are vital to modern manufacturing. 
For example, Trumpf provides automakers with lasers used for welding parts together, saving money and reducing weight. The company’s machines slice fenders from sheet metal for Harley-Davidson motorcycles, and casings for products from Apple, the maker of iPhones and iPods. Advanced technology meets artisanal production in the Trumpf lasers that sear logos onto cheese rinds. The company also has a medical unit.
Deliveries of such high-value products made Germany the world’s largest merchandise exporter six years running through 2008, when it exported 993 billion euros ($1.4 trillion) worth of goods, just edging out China. Trumpf rode that wave, with sales of more than 2 billion euros in the fiscal year that ended in June 2008. But it expects that sales cratered by up to 25 percent in the just-ended fiscal year, heightening worries about layoffs if the slide does not stop.
Trumpf provides its employees with a level of job security unimaginable in the United States. Turnover is negligible. Virtually every high school graduate who undergoes vocational training at Trumpf can expect to move on to a full-time position. New hires expect to spend their careers there.
But as global demand collapsed late last year, companies like Trumpf began grappling with the idea that even family-minded executives, despite their best intentions, cannot uphold their end of such a generous social contract. Unemployment in Germany, already 8.2 percent, is likely to rise through 2010 to near 12 percent, according to economists. 
Frank Wallau, director of the Institute for Mittelstand Research, a group based in Bonn, says that these companies lay off people less readily than public companies that must listen to outside investors. Benign intentions and a desire to retain talent both play a role.
“These companies always tend to hang on to their employees,” Mr. Wallau says. “I’d almost say it negatively: that they hang on too long, and endanger the company.”
IN a word, Trumpf practices paternalism. Although that is common in German manufacturing, a patriarchic world of brainy engineering and patient scientific inquiry, this company’s paternalism takes the form of Mrs. Leibinger-Kammüller, 49, a thin woman with lively eyes, four children and an affinity for clunky pearl necklaces. 
She is also a United States citizen by the grace of her birth in Wilmington, Ohio, during her father’s stint at what is now Milacron, a company based in Cincinnati. But Mrs. Leibinger-Kammüller’s melodiously accented German identifies her as very much a Swabian, as people from the area around Stuttgart are known. 
A philologist by training, she got the top job when her father, Berthold Leibinger, chose her over her brother Peter, an engineer, on the grounds that the growing company needed a generalist at the helm.
 Researchers often put the ceiling for Mittelstand companies at 500 million euros in annual sales, a threshold that Trumpf passed in 1998. And with its granite-and-glass architecture, Barcelona chairs and walls hung with modern art, Trumpf’s headquarters has a distinctly corporate feel. 
But the company’s ethos owes far more to the Bible than to Jack Welch.
Peter Leibinger, a boyish-looking 42, is the third member of Trumpf’s inner circle. He headed the company’s American subsidiary, based in Farmington, Conn., from 1999 to 2003. He arrived there just in time to see orders fall off in the wake of the dot-com boom. Business had been brisk enough that overtime made up 30 percent of paychecks, so Mr. Leibinger decided to limit work to a standard 40 hours a week. Everyone bled, but no one was turned out. 
“I thought they’d be happy with the security,” he says. “I was wrong.”
Top sales staff, used to overtime pay, argued that weaker performers should be let go instead. Faced with a firestorm over his very German solution, Mr. Leibinger relied on a very American principle of management: What the boss says, goes. Period.
 About 15 years ago, Leibinger père put together his family’s principles in a written 20-page codex outlining rights and, above all, the responsibilities of Trumpf’s stewards. The imperative is to run the business in an ethical manner, to take care of employees and to earn a decent profit, which is largely reinvested in the company.
The Leibinger codex flows from the family’s Lutheran faith, and what Peter Leibinger characterized as a “joyless” movement within it known as Pietism, which emphasized personal faith alongside compassion and discipline in daily life, especially in difficult times. 
“This is not a culture where we sit around singing ‘Kumbaya, my Lord,’ ” Mr. Leibinger says.
In the early 1990s, though, the company was singing the blues, as a severe recession forced Trumpf to bring in an outside investor and to lay off 200 of the 3,100 employees it then had. (A small portion, maybe 15 percent, were hired back.)
Mr. Kammüller, who was then already a manager at Trumpf, recalls watching grown men break down as he laid them off. The son of a Lutheran pastor, he says the experience “is the motivation you have to never go through that again.”
Gerd Duffke, a 36-year veteran of Trumpf who is simultaneously deputy chairman and head of its employee committee, says he is certain that the family’s emotions are heartfelt.
“I can judge them well from many years here,” Mr. Duffke says. “I can say with absolute certainty the family wants to avoid layoffs.”
MUCH will depend on how Trumpf, alongside other German exporters, can recast itself after a time when people in other countries, above all the United States, lived beyond their means, creating demand for German products. In fiscal 2008, some 70 percent of Trumpf’s sales were outside Germany.
Stimulus packages have delayed the impact of the pullback in individual and corporate spending. But a small and growing number of economists argue that Germany’s export-driven economic model has to change by the time government spending winds down.
“What happens when the state pulls back?” says Peter Bofinger, an outspoken member of the German government’s council of economic advisers.
Others are more sanguine but do not dispute that a major transformation is coming.
“The Mittelstand managed to handle the changes of the last 50 years, and they’ll do it again,” Mr. Wallau of the research institute says. “Germany is a very open economy, so they have to change. They have no choice.”
The best news for the Mittelstand is that the world does need the goods that they produce. What’s more, the skills and knowledge that underpin their businesses will not vanish with the crisis.
“The question is: Who can satisfy global demand for these kinds of goods?” says Andreas Rees, the chief economist for Germany at UniCredit in Munich. “Germany is in a very good position to do that.”
But Mr. Rees predicts a hard fight for a total volume of business that is now shrinking. Up-and-coming Chinese manufacturers will challenge Germans at the lower end of the market, and if the dollar goes into a sustained swoon, revived American makers of capital equipment will threaten them as well.
Mr. Kammüller pointed out that demand from China had changed as a result of the government’s stimulus package. A year ago, China ordered mostly tools used to make goods for export.
Now, the Chinese are ordering Trumpf machines used to build railroads and other infrastructure projects.
 “China has switched over to more internal demand,” Mr. Kammüller says.
Further out, he predicts that environmentally friendly technologies will expand the horizon of tool makers like Trumpf. Already, its machines are used to shape the metal frames of solar cells.
But cost-cutting everywhere, from production lines to research and development, is unavoidable, Trumpf executives say. 
Employees are tapping “time accounts,” a device that Trumpf and many other companies created over the last decade to cushion the effects of a slowdown. 
During the fat years, employees stored hours of overtime, for which they were not then paid, in anticipation of tougher times. Now those hours are being paid out, keeping paychecks heftier than they would be otherwise.
Mr. Duffke estimates that using the accounts is the functional equivalent of eliminating 1,000 jobs, or about 12 percent of its work force.
 The banked overtime hours will be exhausted this month, and then Trumpf plans to embrace “short-time work,” a program in which the German state finances up to 67 percent of paychecks as long as companies keep their employees on staff. 
This use of tax money, however, may be a bad tradeoff. Though it allows companies to protect their talent in tough times, it also creates a substantial fiscal burden, even though Germany does not face the levels of debt now accumulating in places like Britain and the United States.
The European Central Bank has criticized short-time work as interrupting the normal reallocation of labor to more profitable industries as a recovery emerges.
Mr. Leibinger said that Trumpf expects “a high degree of loyalty” in return for the effort to avoid layoffs. Its engineers are putting in late nights to finish projects on time so that Trumpf’s product line is in good shape when an upswing comes.
MR. LEIBINGER’S sister, too, is coaxing more out of employees, but her patience is not endless.
On a recent afternoon, a somewhat exasperated Mrs. Leibinger-Kammüller was traveling 50 miles to a Trumpf facility responsible for laser sales in Germany. Her plan is to concentrate all of the German sales staff in Ditzingen, saving money but forcing 60 employees either to move or adjust to a lengthy daily commute. The change prompted grumbles from workers, and a debate with management. 
“The world is burning and we’re discussing whether they are able to drive an hour in the morning,” she says, before adding, “I can’t say that, of course.” 
IF asked to identify the intellectual founder of their discipline, most economists today would probably cite Adam Smith. But that will change. Economists’ forecasts generally aren’t worth much, but I’ll offer one that even my youngest colleagues won’t survive to refute: If we posed the same question 100 years from now, most economists would instead cite Charles Darwin. 
Darwin, renowned for the theory of evolution, was a naturalist, not an economist, and his view of the competitive struggle was different from Smith’s in subtle but profound ways. Growing evidence suggests that Darwin’s view tracks economic reality much more closely.
Smith is celebrated for his “invisible hand” theory, which holds that when greedy people trade for their own advantage in unfettered private markets, they will often be led, as if by an invisible hand, to produce the greatest good for all. The invisible hand remains a powerful narrative, but after the recent economic wreckage, skepticism about it has grown. My prediction is that it will eventually be supplanted by a version of Darwin’s more general narrative  one that grants the invisible hand its due, but also strips it of the sweeping powers that many now ascribe to it. 
Smith’s basic idea was that business owners seeking to lure customers away from rivals have powerful incentives to introduce improved product designs and cost-saving innovations. These moves bolster innovators’ profits in the short term. But rivals respond by adopting the same innovations, and the resulting competition gradually drives down prices and profits. In the end, Smith argued, consumers reap all the gains.
The central theme of Darwin’s narrative was that competition favors traits and behavior according to how they affect the success of individuals, not species or other groups. As in Smith’s account, traits that enhance individual fitness sometimes promote group interests. For example, a mutation for keener eyesight in hawks benefits not only any individual hawk that bears it, but also makes hawks more likely to prosper as a species. 
In other cases, however, traits that help individuals are harmful to larger groups. For instance, a mutation for larger antlers served the reproductive interests of an individual male elk, because it helped him prevail in battles with other males for access to mates. But as this mutation spread, it started an arms race that made life more hazardous for male elk over all. The antlers of male elk can now span five feet or more. And despite their utility in battle, they often become a fatal handicap when predators pursue males into dense woods. 
In Darwin’s framework, then, Adam Smith’s invisible hand survives as an interesting special case. Competition, to be sure, sometimes guides individual behavior in ways that benefit society as a whole. But not always. 
Individual and group interests are almost always in conflict when rewards to individuals depend on relative performance, as in the antlers arms race. In the marketplace, such reward structures are the rule, not the exception. The income of investment managers, for example, depends mainly on the amount of money they manage, which in turn depends largely on their funds’ relative performance. 
Relative performance affects many other rewards in contemporary life. For example, it determines which parents can send their children to good public schools. Because such schools are typically in more expensive neighborhoods, parents who want to send their children to them must outbid others for houses in those neighborhoods.
In cases like these, relative incentive structures undermine the invisible hand. To make their funds more attractive to investors, money managers create complex securities that impose serious, if often well-camouflaged, risks on society. But when all managers take such steps, they are mutually offsetting. No one benefits, yet the risk of financial crises rises sharply.
Similarly, to earn extra money for houses in better school districts, parents often work longer hours or accept jobs entailing greater safety risks. Such steps may seem compelling to an individual family, but when all families take them, they serve only to bid up housing prices. As before, only half of all children will attend top-half schools.
It’s the same with athletes who take anabolic steroids. Individual athletes who take them may perform better in absolute terms. But these drugs also entail serious long-term health risks, and when everyone takes them, no one gains an edge.
If male elk could vote to scale back their antlers by half, they would have compelling reasons for doing so, because only relative antler size matters. Of course, they have no means to enact such regulations. 
But humans can and do. By calling our attention to the conflict between individual and group interest, Darwin has identified the rationale for much of the regulation we observe in modern societies  including steroid bans in sports, safety and hours regulation in the workplace, product safety standards and the myriad restrictions typically imposed on the financial sector. 
Ideas have consequences. The uncritical celebration of the invisible hand by Smith’s disciples has undermined regulatory efforts to reconcile conflicts between individual and collective interests in recent decades, causing considerable harm to us all. If, as Darwin suggested, many important aspects of life are graded on the curve, his insights may help us avoid stumbling down that grim path once again.
The competitive forces that mold business behavior are like the forces of natural selection that molded elk. In each case, we see instances of socially benign conduct. But in neither can we safely presume that individual and social interests coincide. 
A judge in New Jersey dismissed on Wednesday a $5 billion defamation lawsuit filed by Donald J. Trump against an author whose book placed Mr. Trump’s personal wealth far below his public estimates.
Superior Court Judge Michele M. Fox in Camden, N.J., found there was insufficient evidence to allow the case to go to trial.
Mr. Trump sued the author, Timothy L. O’Brien, in 2006 after his book “Trump Nation: The Art of Being the Donald” placed Mr. Trump’s wealth at $150 million to $250 million, citing three confidential sources. Mr. Trump argued it was in the billions.
Mr. Trump failed to demonstrate “clear and convincing evidence to establish malice,” Judge Fox ruled, according to Bloomberg News. 
Mr. Trump vowed to press further legal claims, insisting that his wealth was more than $5 billion when the book was released in 2005 and is more than $6 billion now.
“The libel laws in this country have never been fair,” he said. “We proved our case 100 percent. We’ll appeal and see what happens. Unfortunately, the court’s decision today condones the gross negligence, and lack of professionalism and bias on the part of a reporter.”
Mr. O’Brien  now the editor of the Sunday Business section of The New York Times  said he was “deeply gratified that the court’s decision has vindicated the reporting in ‘Trump Nation.’ ”
 The judge also dismissed Mr. Trump’s claims that the co-defendant in the lawsuit, the Hachette Book Group, was “vicariously liable,” concluding that Mr. O’Brien had worked independently on the project. The book was published by a Time Warner subsidiary that was subsequently bought by Hachette.
“We are gratified that the court has granted summary judgment dismissal of Mr. Trump’s meritless lawsuit,” the publisher said in a statement. 
MASSENA, N.Y.  It has been nearly eight years since the 9/11 terrorist attacks, but the fears and anxieties they gave rise to continue to take a toll on the design of public buildings. Even the words “United States,” it seems  when spelled out in the wrong size and color  can be an unacceptable security risk.
Four years ago, when the federal General Services Administration unveiled its plans for a new border-crossing station here in northeastern New York State, the design was presented as part of the agency’s campaign to raise the dismal standards of government architecture. Even many in the famously fractious architectural community celebrated the complex  particularly its main building, emblazoned with glossy yellow, 21-foot-high letters spelling “United States”  as a rare project the government could point to with pride. 
The Customs and Border Protection agency of the Department of Homeland Security seemed to like it too. After years of working closely with the architects, the New York firm of Smith-Miller & Hawkinson, the agency signed off on the final version of the project in 2007.
Yet three weeks ago, less than a month after the station opened, workers began prying the big yellow letters off the building’s facade on orders from Customs and Border Protection. The plan is to dismantle the rest of the sign this week. 
“At the end of the day, I think they were somewhat surprised at how bold and how bright it was,” said Les Shepherd, the chief architect of the General Services Administration, referring to the customs agency’s sudden turnaround.
“There were security concerns,” said Kelly Ivahnenko, a spokeswoman for the customs agency. “The sign could be a huge target and attract undue attention. Anything that would place our officers at risk we need to avoid.” 
 The move is a depressing, if not wholly unpredictable, example of how the lingering trauma of 9/11 can make it difficult for government bureaucracies to make rational decisions. It reflects a tendency to focus on worst-case scenarios to the exclusion of common sense, as well as a fundamental misreading of the sign and the message it conveys. And if it is carried out as planned, it will gut a design whose playful pop aesthetic is an inspired expression of what America is about.
Just as disheartening, it underscores how the desire for security continues to override the spirit of openness that is fundamental to a functioning democracy.
The General Services Administration’s efforts to raise the quality of government architecture date to 1994, when it established its Design Excellence Program to reverse a decades-long trend of government commissions going to firms with the deepest political connections rather than to those with the most talent. One of the program’s greatest accomplishments is that it was able to maintain its high standards of design despite mounting security concerns that began with the 1995 Oklahoma City bombing.
The visual transparency of projects like Richard Meier’s district courthouse in Central Islip, N.Y., completed in 2000, and Morphosis’ 2007 federal building in San Francisco, were proof that it was possible to pump up security without transforming government buildings into fortified bunkers, even as the country’s anxiety mounted over fears of more terrorist attacks.
The Massena station is the latest chapter in that history. As you come over the St. Lawrence River on the bridge from Canada, you see the big sign looming directly in front of you. 
The metal letters spelling out “United States” are painted the yellow of a yield sign. Their top halves are tucked underneath a translucent polycarbonate screen that encloses the second floor of the building, giving them a blurry quality and imbuing the sign with a sense of mystery. You wonder, is this simply an emblem of American pride, or is there something more nuanced going on here? Some private code the viewer is meant to decipher? 
The answers are in the architecture.
As you approach the station, yellow lines funnel you into one of several lanes  some for cars, some for commercial trucks  before disintegrating into a series of yellow bollards that lead to checkpoints to the right and left of the main building. A few yards from the guard booth, ominous-looking security cameras and warning signs flank you on both sides. 
Those with a paranoid turn of mind may feel they have entered a gantlet in which they are relinquishing more and more control to government authority with every step. But any such impression is quickly tempered by a sense of ease of movement. There are no curbs anywhere, which emphasizes the smooth, flowing surface of the asphalt. The slender canopies over the checkpoints resemble airplane wings on a runway, as if parts of the complex were preparing to take off.
This tension  between the need for control and the architects’ desire to create a feeling of lightness and transparency  is apparent everywhere in the design of the crossing station. A few hundred feet beyond the main building, for example, is the Nonintrusive Inspection Building  a giant X-ray machine for trucks. One side of this structure, made of corrugated metal, has a narrow slot window along its base so that from the crossing area the wall seems to be floating, unsupported from below. The back wall, by contrast, is made of one-foot-thick poured-in-place concrete, both to absorb radiation from the X-ray machine and to protect the site’s perimeter.
Even the arrangement of the buildings is more complicated than it at first seems. The big open spaces between them give the site an open, airy quality. But when I asked Laurie Hawkinson, one of the architects, about the layout, she said it was partly designed to create view corridors, so that border officers could monitor anyone approaching them from the surrounding woods.
To some, Smith-Miller & Hawkinson’s mix of pop references and tough everyday materials will bring to mind Robert Venturi and Denise Scott Brown, who famously celebrated the architecture of the Las Vegas strip in the early 1970s. It also owes a debt to the work of postwar Los Angeles architects like Charles and Ray Eames, who were striving to create an architecture that reflected the optimism of the postwar era. Their lightweight structures, made of everyday mass-produced materials, were the sunny face of cold war America.
But in Massena that optimism has been carefully ratcheted down. The buildings’ translucent plastic surfaces are not only about light; they suggest a cautious, at times shadowy, interior world. The lightness of the forms reminds us of how fragile our ideals can sometimes be.
In fact, the sign itself demands multiple readings. Unlike the Freedom Tower, whose name could be interpreted as a jingoistic expression of America’s post-Sept. 11 arrogance, Smith-Miller & Hawkinson’s “United States” sign is politically neutral. Its meaning is constantly changing for the viewer. It communicates openness and possibility, not aggression.
It is hard to see how values like those would make any building a target. They may even seem like something worth defending. They certainly put into question the thinking behind Customs and Border Protection’s decision. It is as if the government is attuned to architecture’s symbolic power, but unable to decipher its meanings.
Donald Trump’s latest resurrection isn’t necessarily a bellwether for other buyouts. The casino mogul turned reality television star has persuaded a bank to restructure a loan to allow his Atlantic City casinos to emerge from bankruptcy  again. While that sounds like an encouraging return of risky lending, it doesn’t necessarily mean financing will flow for private equity firms seeking to fix their own problem companies. 
 Trump Entertainment Resorts entered bankruptcy for the third time in February, and a clash with its bondholders led Mr. Trump to resign as chairman. He subsequently bid to buy the company for $100 million, a deal that the company chose over a competing offer from bondholders. As part of the deal, Beal Bank Nevada agreed to extend the repayment date on a $486 million loan.
 Other investors, including private equity firms, are seeking to restructure loans. But buyout shops aren’t finding it so easy. Deutsche Bank played hardball before recently agreeing to a debt swap proposed by Kellwood, a clothing retailer owned by Sun Capital. And JPMorgan Chase is fighting the bankrupt cable company Charter Communications over a restructuring plan that could disadvantage its senior lenders.
 Beal Bank may be cutting Mr. Trump some slack because the casinos are so closely tied to his personal brand. And Mr. Trump may be a rarity in believing the casinos have a future. Whether they like it or not, he may be lenders’ best hope for recovering some of what they are owed.
 By contrast, some other failed companies have attracted flocks of vultures, giving them more options. Nortel, for example, recently received several bids for one of its units.
 Private equity firms also may not want to take the same trouble as Mr. Trump to revive failed companies they own. They often prefer to leave them in the hands of creditors and move on to other targets. Mr. Trump’s personal involvement in the Atlantic City properties gives him more reason to go the extra mile. Beal Bank must be hoping his third new beginning proves to be the charm.
Price Conspiracy?
The global economy is still suffering, yet the oil price has risen to $72 a barrel, from $34, in five months. Copper, sugar and iron ore prices are also up strongly. Could this be a conspiracy of traders, speculators and investment banks? Britain’s Financial Services Authority is taking a look, following its American regulatory counterparts. 
The debate is fierce. On one side is common sense. Commodity funds and many speculators both chase and create market momentum. They tend to push prices up or down more than is justified by industrial supply and demand. 
On the other side are articulate defenders of a profitable trading business  as well as a mass of confusing market information. Data can be found to demonstrate that “fundamentals” determine prices, especially if those fundamentals include financial conditions and producers’ expectations. 
Regulators are mulling various changes. One would require more transparency. That might help prevent manipulation, but it is still hard to corner markets that are mostly large and liquid. 
The effort to flush out speculators won’t, however, do much to ease price volatility. As long as commodity prices vary with financial trends  rising sharply when money is easy and falling fast when credit is squeezed  these markets will attract traders’ interest. Crack down in one place and they will come up somewhere else. 
There are two effective ways to reduce volatility in commodity prices, though both are beyond the control of market regulators. First, get rid of easy money. With low inflation, reasonably high and stable real interest rates, and credit in fairly short supply, the financial winds wouldn’t blow strongly enough to retain the interest of speculators. 
Second, rely less on spot and more on cost-based prices. Most commodities come out of mines and wells that last decades, and flow to buyers who need steady supplies and would prefer steady prices. 
But for the last few decades, prices have increasingly been set in volatile markets dominated by financial, rather than industrial, considerations. If the trend can be reversed, there will be no need to hunt for the witches of speculation.
LAUREN SILVA LAUGHLIN and EDWARD HADAS 
SAINT-OUEN, FRANCE — From a warehouse in this scruffy suburb outside Paris, Jacques Attali has been building what he calls the “McKinsey” of the microfinance world, a one-stop consulting shop for the sector.
A consummate French insider, Mr. Attali, a former banker and presidential advisor, has recruited big names as board members and advisors, including Bernard Kouchner, co-founder of the Nobel prize-winning Médecins Sans Frontières, now the French foreign minister; and Muhammad Yunus, the Nobel-winning founder of Grameen Bank, a pioneer in the field of microfinance. He has attracted a host of corporate partners, like SAP, the German software company, and BNP Paribas, the largest bank in France.
 The result — PlaNet Finance — now has a staff of 700, about 10 percent based in Saint-Ouen, active in more than 60 countries. Since 1998, it says it has provided help to 140,000 entrepreneurs and set up $80 million in financing.
 It also has an investment arm and offers technical assistance to donors and recipients. Some services, like ratings, have become benchmarks; others, like insurance, are less successful.
 The expansion illustrates just how microfinance — the providing of small business loans to individuals, usually in developing countries — has become big business. Companies like PlaNet Finance and BlueOrchard, based in Geneva, attract not only public investors, but private ones seeking a “double bottom line” of socially responsible returns. 
 Intermediaries, including major investment banks like Citigroup and J.P. Morgan, have jumped on the bandwagon, finding investors and offering services like bond issuance, initial public offerings of shares, ratings and insurance.
 But the growth and hoopla has some in the field worried that the industry, awash in liquidity despite the financial squeeze of the past year, may become overly driven by profit and lose sight of its original aim — reducing poverty. There are also persistent questions about debt burdens and regulation.
 “Wall Street became very excited a few years ago,” said Elizabeth Littlefield, chief executive of the Consultative Group to Assist the Poor, or CGAP, an independent research institute that is based at the World Bank. “There were elements of a bubble. In some countries, institutions were probably growing too fast.”
 Some in the industry privately chide Mr. Attali, for example, of exaggerating PlaNet Finance’s achievements for publicity purposes — but they decline to do so on the record because of his stature.
The company itself concedes it has gone through a bit of a learning curve. 
 “We burned a bit our fingers” in Mexico, where microfinance “developed extremely quickly, with many players entering the field very aggressively,” said Arnaud Ventura, vice president of PlanNet Finance. The results were defaults and a pullback. 
 During an interview, Mr. Attali agreed that “some people” in the industry “are using microfinance as a way for advertising themselves.” He did not name anyone in particular. 
 The aim of microfinance should be creating products that improve lives, Mr. Attali added, so it is not ideally suited to a purely commercial model. But he said that because PlaNet Finance had “very patient shareholders” the group did not have to chase profits. 
 Although PlaNet Finance is a nonprofit organization, he did not rule out going to the market with some products in the future
 Modern microfinance took root during the 1980s, although experiments in Bangladesh — with Mr. Yunus and Grameen — and in other countries occurred earlier. It differed from traditional aid by insisting that loans be repaid, charging interest and seeking poverty reduction via enterprise-building.
 The basic model involves the establishment by governments or investors of microfinance institutions, which channel money, directly or via funds, to local banks and credit offices to lend on. 
 According to research by the CGAP, to be published soon, financing from public and private investors passed $10 billion in December.
 More than half is managed by specialized funds, known as microfinance investment vehicles, run by players ranging from private equity to specialized managers.
 Assets under management grew 16 percent in the first quarter, to $6.6 billion, after rising 31 percent in 2008, and 72 percent in 2007. And fund managers are reporting few redemptions, the institute said. 
 BlueOrchard, the largest commercial microfinance intermediary, estimates that to meet projected demand over the next five years, microbankers will need $10 billion to $20 billion.
 Most of the funds are based in Europe for tax and regulatory reasons. 
 BlueOrchard co-manages the largest specialized fund, the $500 million Dexia Micro-Credit Fund. It has added about $100 million this year.
 Triodos Bank of the Netherlands, another large player, announced a new fund in March, bringing its microfinance funds to €185 million.
 Yet returns are moderating.
 The Symbiotics microfinance index, tracking six of the largest funds, has returned over 2 percent so far this year, compared with about 6 percent last year and in 2007. 
 Over all, the sector is weathering the financial storms “chastened but intact,” according to a CGAP report in February.
 Jean-Pierre Klumpp, BlueOrchard’s chief, said, “We have disbursed in the first half of the year a lot less than before.” But he added that “we actually have funding available. After the crisis in the third or fourth quarter, investors stopped investing.” 
 The financial storm has had other side effects.
 A report in July from the Center for the Study of Financial Innovation, based in London, concluded that lenders were now focusing on credit risk and liquidity; a year ago, management and regulation concerned them.
 “This very rapid growth put a huge strain on branches and management,” Mrs. Littlefield said. “Now there is some pullback” on funds coming in, she said, allowing more focus on improving delivery, which she called “a healthy adjustment.”
 More broadly, there are lingering questions about how funds are channeled and tracked.
 Loïc Sadoulet, a professor of economics at Insead, a French business school, said new rules might be needed to limit risk for the most vulnerable. Some recent reports have found that high rates are being charged — up to 60 percent in countries like Zambia and Bangladesh — and cite aggressive tactics in recouping loans.
 Mr. Attali said his company had been pushing two or three years for an international treaty to regulate microfinance. 
 Others, like Mrs. Littlefield, are not sure that more regulation is the solution. The sector has become more professional, most institutions are fully audited based on internal accountancy norms and nearly 1,000 of them are rated, she said.
 Further out, work needs to be done on the sector’s effects, as most studies so far have been inconclusive, said Dean Karlan, an economics professor at Yale University.
 Microfinance “didn’t transform people’s lives to the extent suggested by the hype,” he said. “We need to know more about how to target and how to design programs.”
 The ultimate benchmark, reducing poverty, suggests “very much a mixed picture,” he said, adding the emphasis should be on savings, rather than lending.
 Still, Mr. Ventura, of PlaNet Finance, points to “many tiny indicators” — surveys and anecdotal reports — “that tell us that the situation is better because of microcredit.”
Matthew Jodrell, a jazz musician, was riding the subway home after a Sunday night performance in Lower Manhattan. Then he made the mistake of nodding off. 
“When the train went under water, I fell asleep, somewhere there around Queensboro Plaza,” Mr. Jodrell said on Tuesday. “My pocket was slashed, but he did not manage to get my wallet. He was really slick. He must have slit my pants swiftly and quickly.”
The thief did not take Mr. Jodrell’s money, but he did take two beloved brass instruments: a flugelhorn made in Switzerland and a Bach Stradivarius trumpet, together worth nearly $10,000.
On Tuesday, the police released photos of the two horns, which were stolen from an N train around 4 a.m. on Aug. 24 after Mr. Jodrell, 29, had played a show at the Highline Ballroom in the meatpacking district. He had been part of the supporting act that night for McCoy Tyner, a former pianist for John Coltrane.
The thief moved so fast, Mr. Jodrell said, that he did not feel a thing. When he woke up, as the train approached the Astoria-Ditmars Boulevard stop, he saw that the black leather case holding the horns, as well as three mutes, three mouthpieces and other equipment, was gone from a spot on the floor between his legs.
Mr. Jodrell got off the train and ran to the previous stop, at Astoria Boulevard. “No one had seen it,” he said  not subway booth attendants, taxi drivers or people on the street. “No one saw anything.”
He went to the 114th Precinct station house to report the theft. He said he figured that he had slept through about five stops on the train, which made all local stops that morning.
Mr. Jodrell said the trumpet, which is brass with a brushed-lacquer finish, belonged to a professor of his at the Juilliard School and was worth about $3,500. He said he had borrowed it a few months ago, and used it in the Aug. 23 show. The flugelhorn, he said, is “raw brass,” without metal plating or lacquer, and was custom-made six years ago by Thomas Inderbinen, a musician and craftsman. It is worth about $6,000.
“I picked it up in Switzerland,” Mr. Jodrell said. “I went to his little factory. It was made for me by him, so it’s very unfortunate. It’s kind of like my baby.”
Mr. Jodrell, originally from Perth, Australia, and now living in Astoria, Queens, came to New York City about a year ago. Next week, he is planning to enter his second year at Juilliard.
In addition to playing at nightclubs, including Smoke Jazz and Supper Club-Lounge on the Upper West Side, he has been a substitute musician for the Broadway musical “Hair.” He also has performed on albums, including for an Australian brass player, James Morrison.
 Mr. Jodrell said he and his girlfriend had put out messages “everywhere” in the hope that someone would see the instruments, contact the police and help detectives crack the case. The police information line is 1-800-577-TIPS.
Being a crime victim has not soured Mr. Jodrell on New York. When asked if he would stay in town to work and study music, he said: “I think so, yeah. Other than this, I love it.”
Four years ago, an angry Donald J. Trump sued his former Hong Kong partners, claiming that they had failed to get the highest price for their 77-acre residential development on the West Side of Manhattan and evaded millions in taxes on the profits. It sounded a lot like sour grapes.
 That is until Thursday, when Robert M. Morgenthau, the Manhattan district attorney, indicted a central figure in the transaction.
Barry D. Gross, who worked for the Hong Kong investors and helped to broker the $1.76 billion transaction, which was then the largest residential real estate deal in the city’s history, has been charged with grand larceny and other crimes related to tax evasion.
 Prosecutors say that Mr. Gross, 45, disguised a $1 million bonus he received as a fee for Itamar Capital, a shell company he controlled, thereby avoiding city and state taxes.
Mr. Morgenthau revealed that the indictment arose from a two-year investigation into whether the Hong Kong partners evaded taxes on $17 million they may have received in addition to the sales price.
Investigators say that the Hong Kong partners, who operated under the name Hudson Waterfront Associates, told the buyers, the Extell Development Corporation and the Carlyle Group, to pay a $17 million finder’s fee to Fineview, a company based in the British Virgin Islands, Mr. Morgenthau said.
But prosecutors said they believed that Fineview was not a legitimate third-party broker and that the $17 million might have ended up in the hands of the Hong Kong partners.
Mr. Morgenthau said investigators were able to track the flow of the money, which was transferred to from the Channel Islands and to London, before ending up in Hong Kong in the hands of someone associated with the investors. By routing the $17 million through Fineview, Mr. Morgenthau said, the investors were able to avoid paying income taxes on it as part of the purchase.
Mr. Morgenthau said he hoped that more arrests were coming in the case, but his office was still trying to track financial records that would spell out the relationship between Fineview and the more than a dozen Hong Kong financiers with connections to Hudson Waterfront Associates. 
Prosecutors said that their investigation dealt with a case of potential tax evasion and had no direct link to Mr. Trump’s claims in the civil suit that the association priced the land too low in the sale. That suit is still pending.
Mr. Trump said Thursday, “I greatly commend the district attorney for his work and feel certain it will continue.” 
Mr. Morgenthau hinted in a press conference in his office that he was hoping for cooperation from Mr. Gross, who prosecutors said avoided paying more than $13,000 in state taxes. Mr. Gross, who faces up to seven years in prison if convicted of third-degree grand larceny, the top charge against him, pleaded not guilty Thursday in State Supreme Court in Manhattan.
A lawyer for Mr. Gross, Benjamin Brafman, said he hoped to persuade Mr. Morgenthau’s office to drop criminal charges.
“In my view, this should have been handled as a civil tax matter,” Mr. Brafman said outside the courtroom.
Mr. Gross’s father is a diamond merchant and business associate of Henry Cheng, chairman of New World Development Ltd. and a leader of the consortium that sold the property that runs from 59th Street to 72nd Street along the Hudson River.
Mr. Cheng and his partners  including Vincent Lo, chairman of Shui On Construction and Materials, and Edward Wong of the Edward Wong Group  bought Mr. Trump’s $300 million mortgage on the land for $82 million in 1994 after Mr. Trump was in danger of losing the still-vacant property to his lenders during the recession. But Mr. Trump retained a share of any profits from a sale.
Mr. Trump, who had first bought the former railyard in 1974 and whose name was characteristically stamped on some of the buildings, was outraged by the 2005 sale, filing a lawsuit claiming that the deal was a “staggering breach” of his partners’ duty to get the highest price. He said that the partners had ignored bids of nearly $3 billion from Colony Capital, an investment company in Los Angeles, and Richard LeFrak, a New York developer. 
 Further, the lawsuit claimed that the investment group led by Mr. Cheng had failed to report hundreds of millions of dollars of profit to “avoid paying taxes in China and the United States.” The suit said that Mr. Trump had uncovered “fraud by the Cheng group amounting to at least $19.7 million.”
Mr. Trump took further umbrage when the partners, instead of immediately handing him his 30 percent share  nearly $500 million used the proceeds to buy the Bank of America Center in San Francisco, and 1290 Avenue of the Americas, a 2 million-square-foot skyscraper in Manhattan. In 2007, the Hong Kong investors sold their stake in those two buildings to Vornado Realty Trust. Mr. Trump retained his portion.
The Emmy Awards telecast on CBS on Sunday attracted its most viewers in three years, but it was no match for “Sunday Night Football” on NBC, which appeared to attract the highest ratings for a regular-season football game in prime time in more than 10 years. Although Nielsen was not expected to release final figures for the New York Giants and Dallas Cowboys game until Tuesday, its overnight household rating of 16.5 easily eclipsed the 13.4 rating posted by last week’s “Sunday Night Football” broadcast, which Nielsen later determined had an audience of 21.1 million viewers. The last prime-time football game, excluding Super Bowls and playoffs, to top a preliminary rating of 16.5 was the December 1998 matchup of the Denver Broncos and Miami Dolphins, which garnered a 17.4 overnight rating and 23.8 million viewers. The Emmys, broadcast on CBS with Neil Patrick Harris as host, delivered an average of 13.3 million viewers, nearly a million more than last year. CBS ranked second on the night behind NBC, earning its highest ratings in the 7 p.m. hour before the Emmys with “60 Minutes” (18 million). Fox was third with reruns, and ABC finished fourth with its broadcast of the 2005 movie “King Kong” (3.9 million).
IT is a royal wedding in real estate circles: Ivanka Trump, 27, daughter of The Donald, and Jared Kushner, 28, the New York Observer publisher whose family owns thousands of apartments and office buildings in New York and New Jersey. For something old, Ms. Trump has said she is embracing Grace Kelly’s style. She has “borrowed” her father’s Bedminster, N.J., golf course for the 500-person reception Oct. 25. The “blue” requirement was met by using what she told brides.com were Tiffany invitations (an insert offered guests a free round of golf at one of Mr. Trump’s courses).
As for new, Ms. Trump has been chronicling her wedding plans on Twitter, starting July 16 with the announcement of her engagement (“truly the happiest day of my life!!!”). She has messaged about eating French fries before squeezing into her Vera Wang gown, meeting with her wedding planner, chanting the mantra “relax, it’s just another party, just another party, just another party ... sigh,” and being blindfolded and ushered to the Hudson River for her Aug. 22 bachelorette party. Ms. Trump told brides.com that she planned to post from her reception, something that at least one of her more than 300,000 followers, Shawn Rabideau, a New York event planner, said was not a good idea: “You should be focused on your guests.”
Those guests have been snapping up items on the couple’s registries at Tiffany, Crate & Barrel, and Williams-Sonoma. The 75 items, totaling nearly $9,000, do not include fine china  perhaps selected somewhere not glimpse-able by anyone with an Internet connection  and reflect a minimalist taste leaning toward glass and sterling. 
BARGAIN HUNTING At Williams-Sonoma, the couple selected four spatulas that each cost $10 or less, along with $19.95 stackable measuring cups. They registered for a dozen 16-ounce glasses and a dozen 10-ounce glasses at Crate & Barrel ($7.95 each), but seem to have received twice that number, according to the Web site. Earlier this week, the six grasscloth lapis placemats ($4.95 each) and matching cotton lapis napkins ($3.95) were taken. These and other kitchen items should all help with preparing and serving the “tuna tartare, rack of lamb, chicken marbella, broccoli kugel, tomato crisp and fresh fruit for dessert” that Ms. Trump posted about on Sept. 25.
A SWEET TOOTH It seems someone in the family likes to bake, or to be baked for. At Williams-Sonoma, the couple registered for half-sheet pans suitable for cookies, a $36 rolling pin, a stylish $34 cubist bundt-cake pan and the kitchen mainstay coveted by many aspiring bakers, the KitchenAid Artisan stand mixer ($299.95). Mr. Rabideau said the array of baking equipment was impressive and the choice of cake pan notably stylish. “There’s a lot of baking,” marveled Mr. Rabideau. “It’s not your average bundt cake — or, as they say in ‘My Big Fat Greek Wedding,’ BOONDT cake.”
FOUR-FIGURE GIFT The most expensive thing on the couple’s three public registries is a sterling silver, scalloped, footed bowl from Tiffany, for $1,350. (They originally requested two, then cut it back to one, which has already been purchased.) There are also sterling silver picture frames, two each at $500, $415 and $295. And while two $175 silver bottle stoppers and two $325 silver cake servers had been taken, they’d love another Elsa Peretti Padova carving fork ($225), carving knife ($225) or sauce ladle ($250). Such items may seem pricey for their limited use, but Mr. Rabideau said the selections show some restraint: “She’s not registering for the Versace everyday dinner set at $1,500 a plate,” he said.
The calendar says we are well on our way to winter, but for many technology companies, orders are starting to bloom like flowers after a spring rain. 
Strong and steady improvement, economists say, would suggest that the United States is truly emerging from the Great Recession. Yet if tech spending fades, it would mean that recovery is further off. 
So far, there are many encouraging signs. The technology giants Intel, I.B.M. and Google delivered better-than-expected quarterly financial results this week, and their executives expressed confidence that the worst was over and a rebound under way. Top executives at Dell, Cisco Systems and other tech companies have also been optimistic recently.
“The worst of the recession is clearly behind us and because of what we have seen, we now have the confidence to be optimistic about our future,” Eric E. Schmidt, Google’s chief executive, told analysts Thursday after the company’s strong earnings report.
Much depends on how the nascent revival in the technology sector plays out. Computer hardware and software are building blocks of the modern economy, as basic as iron ore and coal were to the industrial era. Together, technology products represent about half of all business spending on equipment.
Microchips and clever code animate consumer technology goods, like personal computers and Apple iPhones. Larger computers in data centers power e-mail, electronic commerce and the Internet. 
“This will be a technology-led recovery,” said Edward Yardeni, an economist and investment strategist. “And the improvement we’re seeing from the technology companies suggests the recovery has legs.” 
Paul S. Otellini, chief executive of Intel, the world’s largest semiconductor maker, pointed to his company’s solid third-quarter performance on Tuesday and said it showed that “computing is essential to people’s lives, proving the importance of technology innovation in leading an economic recovery.”
Computer chips like those made by Intel are a key ingredient of technology goods, and spending on the equipment used to make semiconductors is projected to rise by 47 percent in the second half of this year, according to Gartner, a research firm.
On Thursday, I.B.M., a leader in software and technology services sold to companies, reported profits and revenue that surpassed Wall Street’s expectations. 
 The company’s net income rose 14 percent from a year earlier to $3.2 billion, or $2.40 a share. I.B.M. lifted its guidance for full-year profits by 15 cents a share from its previous projection, and added that it expected year-on-year revenue to grow in the current quarter. Revenue in the third quarter fell by 5 percent, adjusted for currency movements, to $23.6 billion.
“We’re seeing more stability in the economy,” Mark Loughridge, I.B.M.’s chief financial officer, said in an interview. “That’s a big improvement over the relentless declines we had been seeing.”
The strongest markets for technology suppliers have been in developing nations, like China, India and Brazil. In the United States, much of the technology spending so far has been by consumers, especially buying personal computers and smartphones. 
But analysts caution that it is too early to tell whether the spending pickup will carry through to a key market: corporations. 
“We’re seeing glimmers of improvement, but it would be premature to say we’re on a strong recovery path,” said Richard Berner, an economist at Morgan Stanley.
Managers who make technology purchase decisions have yet to really open their wallets, although recent surveys of their intentions have become far more positive. Corporate buying tends to trail an economic recovery because companies routinely take several months to budget and plan technology projects. 
“We’re seeing corporate budgets stabilize, and with greater clarity on budgets, companies are able to plan better and move ahead on technology projects,” said Peter Sondergaard, senior vice president for research at Gartner.
Tech industry executives say corporations are preparing to replace their aging personal computers  purchases that were put off during the depths of the recession. There are already some signs that companies are buying new PCs again, executives say, and that could well accelerate after the introduction of the Windows 7 operating system, a Microsoft product that will be released next week.
Companies typically buy new PCs six months or so after Microsoft introduces a new operating system, after they have the chance to test the software and plan their rollout. 
“I think there is a very powerful refresh cycle that is coming,” Michael S. Dell, chief executive of Dell, said in a speech this week. “We are seeing the planning and early stages of this from the clients we serve, which would be about 85 percent of the organizations in the United States that have more than 500 people.”
John T. Chambers, chief executive of Cisco, was even more bullish recently, predicting a substantial increase in productivity at American companies driven by investments in Internet software and hardware. “I think we are entering a period very similar to 1997 to 2004, where you’ll see a decade run of productivity increases,” he said in an interview.
Rising confidence and investment eventually translate into stepped-up hiring. That phase has just begun.
Google, for example, began hiring again in August in response to a pickup in the company’s search and Internet advertising businesses, according to its chief executive, Mr. Schmidt. He said the company was also scouting for acquisitions again.
“I can’t prove it,” Mr. Schmidt said, “but I would hope we’re a leading indicator.”
Infosys, an Indian technology services and outsourcing company, plans to hire 1,000 workers in the United States over the next year. The move is part of its strategy to hire more locals as it expands in the American market. An improving economy would accelerate the program. “We are gaining momentum and will speed up the hiring,” said Nandita Gurjar, a senior vice president at Infosys.
The steady march of digital technology, in industry after industry, is pushing the demand for information technology. The recession curbed spending for a while, and forced organizations to improve the efficiency of their data centers and technology operations. But that goes only so far. In health care, for example, rising demand is being driven by the push for computerized health records, the adoption of digital radiography, digital pathology techniques and telemedicine.
“There is this huge growth in digital data coming in health care, and it is only going to add to the need for computing resources of all kinds,” said Daniel Drawbaugh, chief information officer of the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center, a large hospital and physician group.
Yet the pervasive spread of computing across industries and society, analysts say, also means the long-term growth trend in the tech sector is as much a mirror of the economy as an engine. 
“It is a reflection over all of how the economy is performing,” said Stephen Minton, an analyst at the research group IDC.
JERUSALEM  As the Obama administration tries to broker a resolution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, there is a dark truth lurking: force has produced clearer results in this dispute than talk. 
The results of the violence may prove short-lived  and possibly counterproductive; condemnation of Israel and Hamas is likely to grow after the United Nations Human Rights Council voted Friday to endorse a report detailing evidence of war crimes in Gaza. 
But the reality that war can work is playing a crucial role in the region’s festering conflicts. Some Palestinians are talking again about armed struggle. And Israeli officials, who say their censured military operations have been highly successful, are keeping track of a series of ticking clocks as they ponder still another military endeavor  against Iran.
The payoff from the use of force in the struggle between Israel and the Palestinians is evident. It was only after the first Palestinian uprising in the late 1980s that Israel recognized the Palestine Liberation Organization and started to consider a two-state solution, and after the second  and very bloody  uprising that it left Gaza in 2005. 
Meanwhile for many Israelis, the past decade looks like a model of the primacy of military action over diplomacy. 
Through relentless commando operations and numerous checkpoints, the Israeli Army ended suicide bombings and other terrorist acts from the West Bank; since its 2006 war with the Lebanese militia Hezbollah, widely dismissed as a failure at the time, the group has not fired one rocket at Israel; and Israel’s operation against Gaza last December has greatly curtailed years of Hamas rocket fire, returning a semblance of normality to the Israeli south. 
Two years ago, Israeli fighter planes destroyed what Israel and the United States say was a budding Syrian nuclear reactor; and last year in Syria, Israeli agents assassinated Imad Mugniyah, the top military operative for Hezbollah and a crucial link to its Iranian sponsors, a severe blow to both Hezbollah and Iran.
Diplomatic efforts, whether the Oslo peace talks of the 1990s or the Turkish-mediated negotiations with Syria last year have, by contrast, produced little. Every Israeli military operation of recent years  including the December invasion of Gaza that was condemned Friday by the United Nations Human Rights Council by a vote of 25 to 6 and referred to the Security Council following a report by a committee led by Richard Goldstone  has come under international censure. 
Today all are viewed here as having been judged prematurely and unfairly but having delivered the goods  keeping Israel safe through deterrence. 
Of course the military successes may be of limited value  a battle won but a war lost. The Palestinians may have driven Israel out of Gaza, but they ended up living in a vast network of barriers and military outposts of Israeli occupation in the West Bank and under harsh siege in Gaza. 
And for Israel, while the country is safer today, quieter and more prosperous than ever, it is facing a severe diplomatic crisis. As the storm over the United Nations report on Israel’s attack on Gaza shows, not only are the country’s tactics under assault but so is its very legitimacy as calls for boycott and criminal prosecution grow. Its important relationship with Turkey, a moderate Muslim country, is under threat. 
Ari Shavit, a columnist for the liberal newspaper Haaretz, wrote on Thursday that both Britain in 1917 and the United Nations in 1947 recognized the Jewish people’s right to establish a Jewish state. Yet “as Israel gets stronger, its legitimacy is melting away,” he wrote. “A national movement that began as ‘legitimacy without an entity’ is becoming ‘an entity without legitimacy’ before our very eyes.”
Many Israelis respond that their self-preservation comes ahead of their reputation, that the swiftness and harshness with which their actions are condemned show that the world judges them by a double standard. Others say the isolation looks worse abroad than here. 
Maj. Gen. Gadi Eisenkot, who leads Israel’s northern command, said in an interview that the border with Lebanon was “more peaceful than it has been since the 1960s.” Still, Israel’s enemies “want us gone, so they have pursued a two-part strategy  terror and delegitimization.”
He added that Hezbollah had more than 30,000 rockets in dozens of villages in southern Lebanon being held in reserve for retaliation against Israel should it attack Iran. 
 Israeli officials say no decision to attack Iran has been made, and they hope Iran’s nuclear program will be stopped by other means, like international sanctions.
But they say they believe that if Iran acquires nuclear weapons, the region will grow far more dangerous for Israel, spurring an arms race and offering immunity to Hezbollah and Hamas. And for Israel, whose unofficial motto is “Never Again,” denial of the Nazi Holocaust by Iran’s leaders and their rejection of Israel’s right to exist add up to an existential risk.
Israel is trying to determine the moment beyond which an attack on Iran would be ineffective. It knows an attack cannot end Iran’s nuclear program, only delay it by several years. And if Washington opposes taking military action, it will be very hard to do. 
The first ticking clock Israel is watching is Iran’s enrichment of uranium. Although the process creates low-enriched uranium for electricity but not for weapons, the more low-enriched uranium Iran produces, the less time it will need to turn it into enough high-enriched uranium for a weapon. Israeli analysts say that if Iran were to decide to build a bomb, it would need about 10 months. But after another year of low enrichment, it would need half that time, and after a third year, even less. 
Israel is also watching several other indicators of how long it can delay action. That list includes whether Iran bolsters its ability to withstand an attack by building and acquiring antiaircraft systems and whether Israel’s own scientists can design a missile defense system that could shield the country from retaliation in the form of Hezbollah and Hamas rockets. 
The other ticking clocks focus on internal Iranian politics  whether antigovernment sentiment after June’s election will lead to a slowing or an end to the nuclear program  and on the American-led diplomatic process aimed at getting Iran to abandon the program. Those talks resumed on Monday.
How fast any of the clocks are ticking is a matter of intense study here. If Iran’s program is stopped, Israel says, it will be far easier for it to make concessions that would lead to a Palestinian state on its border. 
But many of its leaders add something else  over the long term, only the Israeli military’s presence on its borders can ensure the country’s survival. Diplomacy, they say, can go only so far, and the Palestinian state will have to submit to severe restrictions on its military activities and pacts with foreign states. 
For their part, the Palestinians reject such restrictions but have similar sentiments about the importance of force. Armed struggle remains central to Hamas doctrine; the rival Fatah movement says it remains an important option. 
Ivanka M. Trump, the daughter of Ivana M. Trump of Palm Beach, Fla., and Donald J. Trump of New York, is to be married Sunday to Jared Kushner, a son of Seryl Kushner and Charles B. Kushner of Livingston, N.J. Rabbi Haskel Lookstein is to officiate at the Trump National Golf Club in Bedminster, N.J. 
The bride, 27, will continue to use her name professionally. She works in New York as the executive vice president for development and acquisitions at the Trump Organization, her father’s real estate company. She is also a principal in a jewelry company, the Ivanka Trump Collection, and is a host of “The Celebrity Apprentice” on NBC. She graduated from the University of Pennsylvania. 
The bride’s mother founded two companies in New York: Ivana Inc., which handles her speaking engagements, books and other commercial ventures; and Ivana Haute Couture, which sells jewelry, perfumes and cosmetics on television. The bride is a stepdaughter of Melania Trump. 
The bridegroom, 28, is the publisher of The New York Observer. He graduated from Harvard and received a law degree and an M.B.A. from New York University. The bridegroom is also a principal in the Kushner Companies in New York, which owns and manages commercial buildings and apartments in New York, New Jersey and Pennsylvania. The bridegroom’s father, who is a founder of his family’s real estate business, stepped down as the company’s chairman in 2004, owing to his legal problems, and has since resumed his title. 
Stocks mostly fell on Tuesday as mixed reports on home prices and consumer confidence gave investors little incentive to step into the market.
A decision by I.B.M. to double its stock repurchase plan propped up the Dow Jones industrial average, but the Nasdaq composite index slid after Baidu, the Chinese Internet search company, warned its revenue could take a hit as it switched its advertising system. Two stocks fell for every one that rose.
Bond prices rose as demand was strong at a government debt auction, signaling that investors were still seeking safety.
Stocks rose at the start of trading after the release of an index showing that home prices in 20 major metropolitan markets increased for a third consecutive month in August. That report, the Standard & Poor’s/Case-Shiller home price index, gained 1 percent in August from July.
The higher home prices were not enough, however, to offset worries that consumers might not be in a mood to spend this holiday season. The Conference Board said its consumer confidence index fell unexpectedly to 47.7 in October, its second-lowest reading since May. Analysts predicted a figure of 53.1.
Worries about consumers have been around for a while, but the confidence numbers took some of the sheen off corporate profit reports for the third quarter, which have been coming in ahead of expectations.
“When I look at the consumer, I think that is the next big test,” said Dave Hinnenkamp, chief executive of KDV Wealth Management in Minneapolis. “We’ve passed a big test on the earnings front.”
The Dow rose 14.21 points, or 0.1 percent, to 9,882.17. The broader Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index fell 3.54 points, or 0.3 percent, to 1,063.41, while Nasdaq fell 25.76 points, or 1.2 percent, to 2,116.09.
Bond prices rose after a Treasury Department auction of $44 billion in two-year notes drew robust demand. That pushed yields lower. The yield on the two-year note fell to 0.94 percent from 1.04 percent late Monday. The Treasury’s benchmark 10-year note rose 29/32, to 101 15/32, and the yield fell to 3.44 percent from 3.55 percent late Monday.
Stocks have fallen for most of the past week on worries about the economy. The Dow dropped 104 points Monday after a similar slide Friday. It was the first consecutive triple-digit loss for the Dow since mid-June.
The latest drops came as a strengthening dollar pushed commodity prices lower. The dollar mostly rose again Tuesday.
Analysts say the coming days could be choppy as traders look for fuel to extend the market’s climb. Frank Ingarra Jr., co-portfolio manager at Hennessy Funds in Stamford, Conn., said the market was about where it should be but could stall if more companies failed to show they would increase profits by bringing in more revenue and not just by slashing costs.
“We have a pretty good valuation here. To propel us to go forward we need to have good top-line growth and you’re just not seeing it,” he said.
Investors are also looking to the government’s first reading on economic output for the third quarter. The report on gross domestic product is due on Thursday and could signal an official end to the recession that many analysts have said is over.
Crude oil rose 87 cents to settle at $79.55 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange. 
I.B.M., one of the 30 companies that make up the Dow, rose after it added $5 billion to its stock repurchase fund. The total now stands at $9.2 billion. The stock advanced 54 cents, or 0.5 percent, to $120.65.
Baidu’s American Depositary shares slid $49.31, or 11.4 percent, to $383.66 after it its warning about revenue.
Following are the results of Tuesday’s Treasury auction of four-week bills and two-year notes: 
Donald J. Trump ended his war with bondholders of the casino company that bears his name, settling Tuesday for 10 percent of Trump Entertainment Resorts once it emerges from bankruptcy.
Mr. Trump announced that he and his daughter Ivanka were abandoning their battle over control of the company, which filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in February. It was the third such filing for the company or its corporate predecessors.
The company had been struggling with crushing debt that became even more painful when the economy soured and competition from casinos in Pennsylvania and New York increased.
The deal reached with 61 percent of the bondholders would give Mr. Trump common stock and warrants worth 10 percent of the reorganized company.
The three Atlantic City casinos  Trump Taj Mahal Casino Resort, Trump Plaza Hotel and Casino and Trump Marina Hotel Casino  will continue to use the Trump name. Mr. Trump will be permitted to use his name on other gambling ventures in states that do not compete directly with the New Jersey properties.
“I have always felt a tremendous responsibility to New Jersey, and especially to Atlantic City,” Mr. Trump said. “Therefore, I am motivated to give the properties the best chance to succeed on a reorganized basis. Had circumstances not changed, I would have aggressively continued to pursue the debtors’ plan with the objective of acquiring control of and revitalizing a company that I have not run for many years.”
But he said the company’s reorganization plan “has become mired in highly expensive and distracting litigation that threatens the entire enterprise. This prolonged and continued litigation and the associated cost to the estate would mean that whoever won under their plan would ultimately lose.”
The deal also would end the litigation by the Trumps against the bondholders, and release them from more than $100 million of claims against them.
Marc Lasry, chairman and chief executive of Avenue Capital Group, a member of the Ad Hoc Committee of creditors, said he was pleased with the agreement.
Kristopher M. Hansen, the lawyer for the bondholders, said the pact should bring a speedy end to a costly legal battle that had been set for a January showdown in federal bankruptcy court. 
Maria Jean Trumpler and Kathryn Marie Dudley were married Monday by the Rev. Johanna Nichols at the Champlain Valley Unitarian Universalist Society in Middlebury, Vt. 
Ms. Trumpler (left) 48, is the director of the Office of Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgender Studies at Yale and a senior lecturer in women’s gender and sexuality studies. She graduated from Princeton and received a Ph.D. in the history of medicine and life sciences from Yale.
 She is a daughter of Irma and William Trumpler of St. Pete Beach, Fla. 
Ms. Dudley, 50, is a professor of American Studies and anthropology at Yale. She is the author of “Debt and Dispossession: Farm Loss in America’s Heartland” and “The End of the Line: Lost Jobs, New Lives in Postindustrial America.” She graduated from the University of Wisconsin, Milwaukee, and received a Ph.D. in anthropology from Columbia.
 She is a daughter of Jack Dudley of Racine, Wis., and the late Marcia Dudley, who lived in Guilford, Conn.
Carl C. Icahn, the investor, agreed to buy most of Trump Entertainment Resorts’ bank debt, pitting Mr. Icahn against a bondholders’ reorganization plan for the casino operator. Mr. Icahn leads a group that will buy a secured loan from the Beal Bank, which is first in line among creditors, and agreed to back the lender’s reorganization plan for Trump Entertainment, according to a statement Friday. Trump Entertainment’s three casinos filed for bankruptcy protection for the third time in February, blaming a high debt load and falling revenue. The founder, Donald Trump, and his daughter, Ivanka, dropped Beal as a partner last month and backed a bondholder plan that would give him up to 10 percent of the reorganized company. 
 “Despite the current problems in Atlantic City I continue to have great faith in the city’s future,” Mr. Icahn said in the statement. The competing plan “is a roll of the dice to releverage these operations, which may well turn into a round-trip ticket to bankruptcy court,” he said. Beal Bank is based in Plano, Tex. Trump Entertainment, based in Atlantic City, owns the Trump Taj Mahal Resort, the Trump Plaza Hotel & Casino and the Trump Marina Hotel Casino.
